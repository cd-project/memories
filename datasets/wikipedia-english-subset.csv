"Major League Baseball All-Century Team

In 1999, the Major League Baseball All-Century Team was chosen by popular vote of fans. To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest Major League Baseball players from the past century. Over two million fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.

The top two vote-getters from each position, except outfielders (nine), and the top six pitchers were placed on the team. A select panel then added five legends to create a thirty-man team:—Warren Spahn (who finished #10 among pitchers), Christy Mathewson (#14 among pitchers), Lefty Grove (#18 among pitchers), Honus Wagner (#4 among shortstops), and Stan Musial (#11 among outfielders).

The nominees for the All-Century team were presented at the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Preceding Game 2 of the 1999 World Series, the members of the All-Century Team were revealed. Every living player named to the team attended.

For the complete list of the 100 players nominated, see The MLB All-Century Team.

Selected players

Pete Rose controversy
There was controversy over the inclusion in the All-Century Team of Pete Rose, who had been banned from baseball for life 10 years earlier. Some questioned Rose's presence on a team officially endorsed by Major League Baseball, but fans at the stadium gave him a standing ovation. During the on-field ceremony, which was emceed by Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, NBC Sports' Jim Gray questioned Rose about his refusal to admit to gambling on baseball.  Gray's interview became controversial, with some arguing that it was good journalism, while others objected that the occasion was an inappropriate setting for Gray's persistence.  After initially refusing to do so, Gray apologized a few days later.  On January 8, 2004, more than four years later, Rose admitted publicly to betting on baseball games in his autobiography My Prison Without Bars.

"Molly Henderson

Molly Henderson (born September 14, 1953) is a former Commissioner of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

The Commissioners are the chief executive and legislative officials of the County, which has 500,000 residents spread over  and an annual County budget of $300 million. 
 Henderson was elected in 2003 to a four-year term 
and was the lone Democrat on the Board of Commissioners in a County where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one.

Henderson was previously Head of Public Health for the City of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the County seat. 

Henderson was not re-elected as Lancaster County Commissioner on November 7, 2007.  Henderson was succeeded by Craig Lehman as the minority Commissioner.

Other careers
She is a former high school and college teacher, holding a doctorate degree from Temple University, a master's degree from West Chester University and her B.S. from James Madison University. Henderson is also a Respiratory Therapist and worked at Lancaster General Hospital prior to her teaching and government careers.

Henderson’s book Pressed: Public Money, Private Profit - A Cautionary Tale tells the story of the development, building, and financing of the Lancaster County Convention Center and Marriott Hotel in downtown Lancaster. The highly controversial “convention center project,” as it was known to those in Lancaster County (pop. 510,000), was originally proposed in 1999 as a $75 million “public-private” partnership. The project included a publicly-owned convention center ($30 million) and a privately-owned hotel ($45 million). By the time the convention center and hotel opened in 2009, the project’s cost had ballooned to more than $170 million, with more than 90% of the total cost of both the convention center and hotel borne by Pennsylvania taxpayers.

Political views
Henderson is a notable opponent of the Lancaster County Convention Center Authority's controversial $170 million hotel/convention center in downtown Lancaster on the site of the former Watt & Shand building.
 The project's supporters believe it would promote the revitalization of the city's center. Its opponents, however, feel it poses an unacceptable risk to taxpayers.
The hotel portion of the project is owned 50% by Lancaster Newspapers, Inc. which have been accused of using their monopoly print position in the County to promote the project and stifle opposition. Henderson has been referenced in more than 2,200 newspaper articles, over 700 of which concern the Lancaster County Convention Center project, many of them attacking her position.

Personal life
Henderson is married to Alex Henderson and has two children, Alexander ""Ander"" Henderson and Leslie Henderson.

"Florida National Cemetery

Florida National Cemetery is a United States National Cemetery located near the city of Bushnell in Sumter County, Florida. Administered by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs it encompasses  and began interments in 1988. It is now one of the busiest cemeteries in the United States.

History
Florida National Cemetery is located in the Withlacoochee State Forest, approximately  north of Tampa. The forest was acquired by the federal government from private landowners between 1936 and 1939 under the provisions of the U.S. Land Resettlement Administration. The United States Forest Service managed the property until a lease-purchase agreement transferred it to the Florida Board of Forestry in 1958. Currently, Withlacoochee State Forest is the second-largest state forest in Florida, divided into eight distinct tracts of land.

In 1842, Congress encouraged settlement here by establishing the Armed Occupation Act. The law granted a patent for  to any man who kept a gun and ammunition, built a house, cultivated  of the land and remained there for at least five years. Settlers moved in to take advantage of the generous offer. The area contained abundant timber and suitable farmland, appealing attributes to frontiersmen. In 1845 Florida was granted statehood.

During the Civil War, a sugar mill on the Homosassa River supplied sugar to the Confederacy. A robust citrus-growing industry developed in the eastern part of the area and became a focus of intense economic expansion soon after the war.

In 1980, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that it would establish a new national cemetery in Florida, its fourth. Two major locations for the cemetery were studied: property near the Cross Florida Barge Canal and the Withlacoochee State Forest. The Withlacoochee site, though more environmentally sensitive, was supported by government officials. In February 1983, the state transferred land to the VA for the development of a Florida National Cemetery. The first burial was in 1988 and a columbarium was opened in November 2001.

In 1999, federal officials asked the Florida Cabinet to grant land for the expansion of the Florida National Cemetery, providing 65,000 to 100,000 grave sites for veterans in the state. Environmentalists argued that Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Forestry Division officials did not state whether the 179 acres of land within the Withlacoochee State Forest was surplus in accordance to a Florida constitutional amendment concerning the acquisition of land for conservation. Before the Florida Cabinet meeting on October 26, the Department Veterans Affairs and the Florida Cabinet agreed that 42 acres would be removed as they served as the habitat for several endangered species. Florida governor Jeb Bush and the Florida Cabinet voted 7-0 in favor of selling 137 acres of land to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the cemetery's expansion.

"Mai-Mai

The term Mayi-Mayi or Mai-Mai refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of Rwandan forces and Rwanda-affiliated Congolese rebel groups, but some may have formed to exploit the war for their own advantage by looting, cattle rustling or banditry.

Groups that fall under the umbrella term ""Mai-Mai"" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated resistance fighters. Because Mai Mai have had only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.

Mai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, North Kivu and South Kivu (the ""Kivus""), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied Banyamulenge-dominated rebel faction, the Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma (RCD-Goma) during the Second Congo War. While militias have long been common in the Kivus, particularly among the minority Batembo and Babembe ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai-Mai. Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 Lusaka Accord meant to end the Second Congo War, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict and the lack of cooperation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process.

Mai-Mai in North and South Kivu

According to a 2001 UN report, 20,000 to 30,000 Mai-Mai were active in the two Kivu provinces. The two most powerful and well-organized Mai-Mai groups in the Kivus were led by Generals Padiri and Dunia. Currently most active is a group which is called Mai-Mai Yakutumba, was organized in 2007 by General Yakutumba. They were reported to have received aid from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and are widely viewed by other Mai Mai groups as the leaders, though not the commanders, of the Kivu Mai-Mai. A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the Mudundu 40/Front de Résistance et de Défense du Kivu (FRDKI) and Mouvement de Lutte contre l'Agression au Zaïre/Forces Unies de Résistance Nationale contre l'Agression de la Républíque Démocratique du Congo (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the Rwandan military and Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma (RCD-Goma).

Walikale and Masisi north of Goma were the centres of Mai-Mai activity in North Kivu.  In South Kivu, there have historically been concentrations around Walungu and Bunyakiri south of Lake Kivu, around Uvira and Mwenaga at the northern end of Lake Tanganyika, further south around Fizi, and around Shabunda, between the Rwandan border and Kindu.

A Mai-Mai leader, Colonel Mayele, was arrested by UN forces in October 2010, allegedly being the leader behind mass rapes in the Walikale region of North Kivu province.

Mai-Mai in Katanga

A former leader of the Mai-Mai, Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga, turned himself over to MONUC troops in May 2006. He was found guilty of numerous war crimes between October 2003 and May 2006 and was sentenced to death by the Kipushi Military Tribunal in Katanga Province on 6 March 2009. He escaped from prison in September 2011 and formed the Mai-Mai Kata Katanga (""Secede Katanga"").

Other Mai-Mai groups

There was a large Mai-Mai presence in Maniema, in particular around Kindu and Kalemie.  Province Orientale also hosts a number of Mai-Mai, but these groups were apparently involved in long-standing ethnic disputes.

Mai-Mai Gedeon is also commanded by Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga and loosely tied to his Mai-Mai Kata Katanga. The Corak Kata Katanga also known as the Co-ordination for a Referendum on Self-determination for Katanga, composed mainly of former Katanga Tigers, a separatist group active in the 1960s. They claim to be behind the attack on the Katanga airport in February 2011. It is unclear to what extent all these groups are co-ordinated.

The Nduma Defense of Congo (or Mai-Mai Sheka) was formed in 2009 by former minerals trader Ntabo Ntaberi Sheka, an ethnic Nyanga. Sheka claims the group was formed to liberate the mines of Walikale Territory in North Kivu. The NDC are accused of a mass rape of at least 387 women, men, and children over a three day span in Walikale in 2010.

Mai-Mai and the mountain gorillas

In May 2007, Mai-Mai killed two wildlife officers in Virunga National Park and threatened to kill mountain gorillas if the government retaliated. The Mai-Mai are also suspected of the killings of nine mountain gorillas, with the use of machetes, and automatic weapons. In an October 2012 incident, Mai-Mai killed two park staff and a soldier, while three soldiers were injured. From 1990 to 2018 some 170 Virunga Rangers have died in such attacks, according to the World Wildlife Foundation. 

Six Virunga Park Rangers were reported to have been killed in Virunga National Park. Five rangers and a driver were killed in an ambush and a sixth ranger was injured in the Central section of the vast reserve on April 9, 2018. Officials suspected the attacks were by the Mai-Mai.

"Neighbors (novel)

Neighbors is a 1980 novel by American author Thomas Berger. It is a satire of manners and suburbia, and a comment on emotional alienation with echoes of the works of Franz Kafka. Earl Keese’s character and situation begin realistically but become increasingly fantastic. Keese is an Everyman whose life is swiftly turned upside down. As he scrambles to reclaim his sense of normalcy and dignity, he comes to think that everyone, including his family, is against him.

Plot summary 

Earl Keese is a middle-aged, middle-class suburbanite with a wife, Enid, and teenage daughter, Elaine. Earl is content with his dull, unexceptional life, but this changes when a younger, less sophisticated couple, Harry and Ramona, move in next door. Harry is physically intimidating and vulgar; Ramona is sexually aggressive, and both impose themselves on the Keese household. Their free-spirited personalities and overbearing and boorish behavior endear them to Enid and Elaine, but Earl fears that he is losing control of his life and his family. Over the course of one night, the antagonism between Earl and his new neighbors escalates into suburban warfare.

Analysis 
Berger's off-kilter tone blurs the line between paranoia and reality, defense and offense, action and intention, ally and adversary. Harry and Ramona seem to constantly undergo changes in their respective personalities and Enid and Elaine appear to choose sides against Earl at random, but Berger also implies that it is Earl’s sense of reality that is skewed and deluded.

Earl is frustrated because he can never prove that Harry and Ramona are doing anything wrong on purpose, and the more he attempts to expose them, the more ridiculous he makes himself. Yet Earl comes to realize that Harry and Ramona have served as the crucible of his redemption: being forced out of his comfort zone of complacency and habit has provided him with an excitement he has never known before. As Earl comes to recognize value in his neighbors, he realizes that his wife is a distrustful alcoholic, his daughter is an underachiever and petty thief, and that his new neighbors can provide him with an escape from his existence of insignificance and emotional impotence. From a nightmare comes hope and a strengthened resolve to survive. In his study of Berger, writer Stanley Trachtenberg describes Neighbors as an existentialist parable in which ""the loss of coherence between various aspects of self comically fragments the notion of identity and thus fictionalizes the existential concept of authenticity as a shaping condition of it."" 

In a 1980 newspaper interview, Berger said of Neighbors, ""As my 10th novel, begun at the close of my 20th year as a published novelist, it is appropriately a bizarre celebration of whatever gift I have, the strangest of all my narratives . . . the morality of this work, like that of all my other volumes, will be in doubt until the end of the narrative – and perhaps to the end of eternity, now that I think about it.""

Adaptations

"Brown Man of the Muirs

In the folklore of the Anglo-Scottish border the Brown Man of the Muirs is a dwarf who serves as a guardian spirit of wild animals.

Folklore
William Henderson provides an account of the Brown Man and a pair of hunters in Folklore of the Northern Counties (1879), taken from a letter sent by the historian Robert Surtees to Sir Walter Scott:

In the year before the Great Rebellion two young men from Newcastle were sporting on the high moors above Elsdon, and at last sat down to refresh themselves in a green glen near a mountain stream. The younger lad went to drink at the brook, and raising his head again saw the ""Brown man of the Muirs"", a dwarf very strong and stoutly built, his dress brown like withered bracken, his head covered with
frizzled red hair, his countenance ferocious, and his eyes glowing like those of a bull. After some parley, in which the stranger reproved the hunter for trespassing on his demesnes and slaying the creatures who were his subjects, and informed him how he himself lived only on whortleberries, nuts, and apples, he invited him home. The youth was on the point of accepting the invitation and springing
across the brook, when he was arrested by the voice of his companion, who thought he had tarried long, and looking round again ""the wee brown man was fled."" It was thought that had the young man crossed the water the dwarf would have torn him to pieces. As it was he died within the year, in consequence, it was supposed, of his slighting the dwarf's admonition, and continuing his sport on the way home.Taylor, George and Raine, James (1852). A Memoir of Robert Surtees. Durham: George Andrews. pp. 81–2.

Walter Scott in a return letter to Surtees suggested that the Brown Man may be related to the duergar (dwarfs) of Northumberland.

Fairy tales
In folklore the Brown Man appears as a solitary fairy, but in fairy tale literature he is a member of a tribe of similar beings. They once lived all over England and Scotland, but in the wake of human progress they dwindled in number and now live in a cave in Cumberland. Known as the Brown Men of the Moors and Mountains, they have great strength that allows them to hurl small boulders. By day they mine the mountains for gold and diamonds, and by night they feast in their underground hall or dance on the moors. They kidnap human children and kill any man they catch alone in the wilderness. However, they can be made subservient by repeating the incantation, ""Munko tiggle snobart tolwol dixy crambo"".

"Frederick Lohden

Frederick Charles Lohden OBE (13 June 1871 – 13 April 1954) was an English sportsman who played rugby union as a forward at international level for England in a single game during the 1893 Home Nations Championship. After retiring from playing sport he became a sports administrator, most notably as the chairman of the Lawn Tennis Association.

Personal history
Lohden was born in Hartlepool in the north of England on 13 June 1871 to Jacob and Mary Lohden, and christened at Christ Church, Hartlepool on 12 July of that year. He attended Durham School as a youth, completing his education in France and Germany. In 1898 he was married to Margaret Emily Marshall of Broadwater, Sussex.

With the outbreak of the First World War, Lohden, who already had military experience, was promoted to Lieutenant in the 4th Durham Volunteer Artillery. He later joined the East Surrey Regiment. In 1917 he was transferred to the Ministry of Shipping and was placed in charge of Standard Steamers, Russian Steamers and Oilers. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours for his work for the Ministry of Shipping. He later moved to Cheam on the border between London and Surrey where he worked as a shipping broker. Lohden later became the mayor of Sutton and Cheam, and was also made a Justice of the Peace.

Sporting history
Lohden showed promise as a sportsman while a youth, making the Durham School rugby XV while still a 15-year-old, the biggest forward in his team. On his return from education in mainland Europe he joined Hartlepool Rovers, and by the age of 19 he was selected to play at county level for Durham. By the 1892/93 season he was playing for one of England's premier clubs, Blackheath. While representing Blackheath he came to the attention of the English selectors and was chosen for the South of England team in the trials of the England squad. He was given his first and only cap in the opening game of the 1893 Home Nations Championship against Wales at the Cardiff Arms Park. The game started well for the English side, opening a 7–0 lead in the first half, one of the two tries scored by Lohden. A further England try at the start of the second half appeared to give England an overwhelming lead only to see an historic Welsh comeback, led by their talismanic captain Arthur Gould, which snatched victory from England in the final minutes. Although Lohden never played for England again, a series of minor injuries ending his career by 1896, he was selected for invitational tourists the Barbarians in 1893, and also represented Surrey county. After retiring from playing he kept up his connection with the sport of rugby by being elected onto the Durham County Rugby Union committee, serving them from 1896 to 1902.

As well as rugby, Lohden was a keen sports shooter, and won the Baltic Exchange 'miniature' Championship for three years running. On returning to civilian life after the war, Lohden became increasingly active in the world of racket sports. A skillful badminton player he represented Surrey County playing in four consecutive London Badminton doubles finals in 1920. This was followed by the title of Veteran's Doubles Champion of England in 1921. That year Lohden also set up the Surrey Badminton Association, becoming their first honorary secretary.

In 1907 Lohden put his sporting administrative abilities to further use when he was elected to the Surrey branch of the Lawn Tennis Association. He progressed to becoming the organisations chairman, and then in 1911 he joined the Council of the LTA. In 1933 he became chairman of the LTA and the year later its vice-president.

"Association of Chief Police Officers

The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), officially The Association of Chief Police Officers of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, was a not-for-profit private limited company that for many years led the development of policing practices in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Established in 1948, ACPO provided a forum for chief police officers to share ideas and coordinate their strategic operational responses, and advised government in matters such as terrorist attacks and civil emergencies. ACPO coordinated national police operations, major investigations, cross-border policing, and joint law enforcement. ACPO designated Senior Investigative Officers for major investigations and appointed officers to head ACPO units specialising in various areas of policing and crime reduction.

ACPO was led by Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde, QPM, who was, until 2009, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland.  He was elected as president by fellow members of ACPO in April 2009.

ACPO was funded by Home Office grants, profits from commercial activities and contributions from the 44 police authorities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

Following the Parker Review into ACPO, it was replaced in 2015 by a new body, the National Police Chiefs' Council, set up under a police collaboration agreement under Section 22A of the Police Act 1996.

Background

UK policing sprang from local communities in the 1800s. Since the origins of policing, chief officers have regularly associated to discuss and share policing issues. Although ACPO as now recognised was formed in 1948, records of prior bodies go back to the early 1900s. The UK retains a decentralised model of policing based around the settlement which emerged from the Royal Commission on the work of the Police in 1962.

ACPO continued to provide a forum for chief officers across 44 local police forces and 13 national areas across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and provided local forces with agreed national policies and guidelines.

ACPO failed to convince its sponsors to contribute to its survival and in May 2011 the BBC reported that ACPO would run out of money in February 2012 without extra funding. ACPO was half-funded by the Home Office and half by 44 police authorities. A third of police authorities refused to pay in 2010 and another third were undecided. The Association of Police Authorities said the withdrawal of funding by police authorities was ""partly due to a squeeze on their income"". ACPO was due to wind up formally in April 2015.

Constitutional status

Over time, demands for coordination across the police service increased as society changed, for example to take account of new developments in international terrorism and organised crime, or roles such as monitoring offenders on release from prison or working with young people to divert them from crime.

In 1997 ACPO was incorporated as a private company limited by guarantee. As a private company, ACPO was not subject to freedom of information legislation. It was not a staff association; the staff association for senior police officers was a separate body, the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA).

The change in structure from a ""band of volunteers"" to a limited company allowed the organisation to employ staff, enter into contracts for accommodation and publish accounts.

A number of options were considered for the status of ACPO, including charitable status, but all were discounted.

Chief Constables and Commissioners are responsible for the direction and control of policing in their force areas. Although a national body and recognized by the government for consultation, ACPO had no powers of its own, nor any mandate to instruct chief officers.  However, the organisation allowed chief officers to form a national policy rather than replicate the work in each of their forces. For example, after the 1980–81 riots in 27 British cities including in St. Pauls and Brixton ACPO began to prepare the Public Order Manual of Tactical Operations and Related Matters.  Police forces began training in its tactics late in 1983.

Membership
ACPO was not a staff association. It acted for the police service, not its members. The separate Chief Police Officers Staff Association acts for chief officers.

ACPO was composed of the chief police officers of the 44 police forces in England & Wales and Northern Ireland, the Deputy Chief Constable and Assistant Chief Constable of 42 of those forces and the Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Assistant Commissioner and Commanders of the remaining two - the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. Certain senior non-police staff and senior members of national police agencies and certain other specialised and non-geographical forces in the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands were also members.

As of March 2010 there were 349 members of ACPO. The membership elected a full-time President, who held the office of Chief Constable under the Police Reform Act 2002.

ACPO bodies
ACPO was responsible for several ancillary bodies, which it either funded or which received Home Office funding but which reported to ACPO:

ACPO Criminal Records Office
The ACPO Criminal Records Office (ACRO) was set up in 2006 in response to a perceived gap in the police service's ability to manage criminal records and in particular to improve links to biometric data. The initial aim of ACRO was to provide operational support relating to criminal records and associated biometric data, including DNA and fingerprint recognition.

It also issues police certificates, for a fee, needed to obtain immigration visas for countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States.

The organization continues under the style ""ACRO Criminal Records Office"" under the control of Hampshire Constabulary.

ACPO Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service
The Association of Chief Police Officers Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS), later the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NAVCIS), was managed by ACPO, and was responsible for combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime.

National Community Tension Team
The National Community Tension Team (NCTT) was an ACPO body which monitored religious, racial, or other tensions within communities, and provided liaison between police forces and community organisations.

National Counter Terrorism Security Office
The National Counter Terrorism Security Office was funded by, and reported to, ACPO and advised the British government on its counter terrorism strategy.

Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre
ACPO was responsible for coordinating the national mobilisation of police resources at times of national need through the Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre (PNICC), which it set up in 2003. This included ensuring policing resilience during major events such as emergency response to serious flooding or the investigation of a terrorist attack. PNICC sat alongside the government in COBR (Cabinet Office Briefing Room) to advise on national issues. PNICC also handled support to overseas crises involving UK nationals.

It employed three full-time staff, with other staff seconded to it as needed and is funded by contributions from each of the police forces.

Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit

The Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) was set up in 2010 by ACPO (and run by the Metropolitan Police) to remove unlawful terrorist material content from the Internet with a focus on UK based material.

The December 2013 report of the Prime Minister's Extremism task force said that it would ""work with internet companies to restrict access to terrorist material online which is hosted overseas but illegal under UK law"" and ""work with the internet industry to help them in their continuing efforts to identify extremist content to include in family-friendly filters"" which would likely involve lobbying ISPs to add the CTIRU list to their filters without the need for additional legislation.

National Wildlife Crime Unit
The National Wildlife Crime Unit is a national police unit that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies.

Controversies

Freedom of information
ACPO had been criticised as being unaccountable to Parliament or the public by virtue of its limited company status. In October 2009 Sir Hugh Orde stated that ACPO would be ""more than happy"" to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. On 30 March 2010, the Ministry of Justice announced that ACPO would be included under the FOI Act from October 2011. In its response, the organisation stated that ""Although organisations cannot voluntarily comply with the Act, a large proportion of ACPO's work is public already or available under FOI through any police force"". In January 2011 its website still said it: ""is unable to do is to respond to requests for information under the Act. The organisation is too small and there are too few members of staff to be able to conduct the necessary research and to compile the responses"". From November 2011, however, FOI requests could be made to ACPO.

Confidential Intelligence Unit
In February 2009, the Mail on Sunday highlighted the involvement of ACPO in setting up the ""Confidential Intelligence Unit"" as a specialised unit to monitor left-wing and right-wing political groups throughout the UK.

Commercial activities
The February 2009 Mail on Sunday investigation also highlighted other activities of the ACPO including selling information from the Police National Computer for £70 despite it costing them only 60p to access it, marketing ""police approval"" logos to firms selling anti-theft devices and operating a separate private firm offering training to speed camera operators.

Apartments
The organisation was criticised in February 2010 for allegedly spending £1.6 million per year from government anti-terrorist funding grants on renting up to 80 apartments in the centre of London which were reported as being empty most of the time. The organisation responded that it had reviewed this policy and would reduce the number of apartments.

Undercover activities
As a result of The Guardian articles with regards to the activities and accusations of PC Mark Kennedy of the National Public Order Intelligence Unit within the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit, and the collapse of the subsequent trial of six activists, a number of initiatives and changes were announced:
Acknowledging that ""something had gone very wrong"" in the Kennedy case to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Home Office minister Nick Herbert stated that ACPO would lose control of three teams involved in tackling domestic extremism. Herbert announced that the units would be transferred to the Metropolitan Police, with acting commissioner Tim Godwin confirming that this would occur at the earliest possible timescale.
Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary announced that Bernard Hogan-Howe would lead an investigation into ACPO, to assess whether undercover operations had been ""authorised in accordance with law"" and ""proportionate"".
The Association of Police Authorities said it was ending its annual £850,000 grant to ACPO.

DNA database

ACPO has supervised the creation of one of the world's largest per-capita DNA databases, containing the DNA profiles of more than one million innocent people. ACPO's guidelines that these profiles should only be deleted in ""exceptional circumstances"" were found to be unlawful by the UK Supreme Court in May 2011. They were found to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, following the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in S and Marper v United Kingdom. On 1 May 2012, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 completed its passage through Parliament and received Royal Assent. To date, ACPO has not reissued revised guidelines to replace its unlawful DNA exceptional procedure. Big Brother Watch, in a report of June 2012, concludes that despite the Protection of Freedoms Act, the retention of DNA in England and Wales remains an uncertain and illiberal regime.

Fake uniforms

During the summer of 2011, Hugh Orde, then president of the ACPO, was seen wearing a dark blue police-style uniform with ACPO insignia, and was accused of wearing a fake uniform. Senior police officers claimed that the uniform was not that of any police force in the country but ""closely resembled"" the uniform worn by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Paul Stephenson. Sam Leith, an author, journalist and literary editor of The Spectator, mocked Orde's decision ""to wear this Gadaffi-style pretend uniform on television"", and suggested it was ""a subliminal pitch for the Met Commissioner's job."" Brian Paddick, at the time the Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, said: ""It's unusual for the president of ACPO to appear in all these interviews in uniform. He is sending a clear signal: how would I look in the commissioner's uniform?"" One officer noted: ""If anything, Hugh should be wearing the uniform of the Police Service of Northern Ireland because that's where he served. But their uniform is green, not the dark blue he currently wears."" An ACPO spokesperson stated that the ""Police Reform Act 2002 states that the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers holds the rank of chief constable. Not being a member of a particular force, the President wears a generic police uniform"".

Parker Review 
In 2013, an independent review of ACPO by General Sir Nick Parker was published. It recommended that ACPO be replaced by a new body, in the interests of greater transparency and cost effectiveness.  On the basis of these recommendations, a new organization, the National Police Chiefs' Council, was set up to replace ACPO, which it did on 1 April 2015.

"Sand Ridge State Forest

Sand Ridge State Forest is a conservation area located in the U.S. state of Illinois.  Containing , it is the largest state forest in Illinois.  It is located in northern Mason County.  The nearest town is Manito, Illinois and the nearest numbered highway is U.S. Highway 136.  It is located on a low bluff, or ""sand ridge"", overlooking the Illinois River, hence the name.  The sand ridge is believed to be an artifact of the post-glacial Kankakee Torrent.

The Sand Ridge State Forest largely dates back to 1939, when the state of Illinois purchased parcels of submarginal sandy farmland for conservation purposes.  The Civilian Conservation Corps planted pine trees on much of the land.  Today, the  state forest contains  of dryland oak-hickory woodlands,  of pine woodlands, and  of open fields and sand prairies. Endemic species include the prickly pear cactus, Opuntia, more familiar to Mexicans and residents of the U.S. Southwest.   

The Sand Ridge State Forest contains the Clear Lake Site, an archeological site listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Current status

In the 2010s, Sand Ridge is managed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) as open space for active recreational purposes, especially whitetail deer hunting.  Revis Hill Prairie, also located within Mason County, is operated by IDNR as a disjunct area of Sand Ridge State Forest.  

In early 2012, Sand Ridge State Forest lost about  to a fire caused by a man burning brush in high winds which sparked the trees.

"Manhattan Airport Foundation

The Manhattan Airport Foundation is a parody advocacy organization lobbying, as part of a hoax, for the development of an international airport replacing Central Park between 59th Street and 110th Street in Manhattan. The Foundation claims to have been founded in 2006 and that it is composed of members of civic, environmental and community groups as well as elected officials and city and state agencies.

The Foundation states that their proposed 'Manhattan International Airport' would be the largest public works project to be undertaken in New York since the creation of Central Park. Once built, the Airport would provide a much needed international air hub offering vital transportation access to individuals living and working in the center of Manhattan.

"Stone flaming

Stone flaming or thermaling is the application of high temperature to the surface of stone to make it look like natural weathering.  The sudden application of a torch to the surface of stone causes the surface layer to expand and flake off, exposing rough stone.    

Flaming works well on granite, because granite is made up of minerals with differing heat expansion rates.

Process

After removing a rock from a quarry, the rock is sliced into multiple flat slabs using a diamond gang saw.  The saw leaves flat surfaces with circular marks.   Flaming is done by wetting, and then running an oxygen-acetylene or oxygen-propane torch over the surface.  As seen in both photos, the torch is usually kept at a 45 degree angle to the stone.

Alternatives
Alternative techniques for creating a rough surface on sawed stone include:

 bush hammering 
 sandblasting
 hydrofinishing

"Avalancha de Éxitos

Avalancha de Éxitos (Avalanche of Hits) was Café Tacuba's third album. In 1996, two years after their acclaimed Re, the band had amassed enough new music to fill four CDs, but couldn't winnow it down to a single album. So instead, they covered eight songs by other Spanish-speaking artists, who ranged from totally obscure to well-known.

Track listing

All the covers are very different from the originals - and from each other. Chilanga Banda is a hip-hop piece in Mexican slang (featuring the sound ""ch""), and Ojalá Que Llueva Café is marked by fast-paced fiddle and rapid switching from chest register to head register - reminiscent, in fact, of yodeling. This is a continuation of the precedent the band established with Re, their previous album, of constant genre-shifting.

"Burry Port railway station

Burry Port railway station served the town of Burry Port (). It continued to serve the inhabitants of the area near Llanelli between 1909 and 1953 and was one of several basic halts opened on the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway in Carmarthenshire, Wales ().

History

The station was opened as Burry Port in 1898 but regular passenger services began on 02 August 1909 by the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway on the Kidwelly and Burry Port section of the line and was closed by the British Transport Commission in 1953 with the last passenger train running on Saturday 19 September 1953. It was on the southern section of the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway with Pembrey to the north and Burry Port as the termuinus of the passenger line.

The line had been built on the course of an old canal with resulting tight curves, low bridge clearance and a tendency to flooding. The freight service continued for coal traffic on the Cwmmawr branch to Kidwelly until 1996 by which time the last of the local collieries had closed down and the washery closure followed.

Pembrey amd Burry Port on the West wales line lies to the east.

Infrastructure

The station had a single short platform, a brick built toilet block and a substantial corrugated iron ticket office and waiting room with a canopy on the northern side of the single line. The station had a run round passing loop and two carriage sidings, one of which also served a goods shed. Signalling was present.

The Kidwelly route was used for coal trains, resulting in the lifting of track between Trimsaran Road and Burry Port by 2005.

Burry Port railway station on the West Wales line stood close to the site of the old Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway.

Services
The station was open for use by the general public by 1909.

Remnants
The section of the old line between Burry Port and Craiglon Bridge Halt is now a footpath and the NCN 4 cyclepath. The station site is now part of a roundabout.

"Šeduva

Šeduva () is a city in the Radviliškis district municipality, Lithuania. It is located  east of Radviliškis.

Šeduva was an agricultural town dealing in  cereals, flax and linseed, pigs and geese and horses, at the site of a royal estate and beside a road from Kaunas to Riga.   The population from the fifteenth century was Catholic and Jewish. Until then, Lithuania had been the last pagan kingdom in Europe and allowed freedom of worship and toleration of Jews and other religions. The first Catholic shrine of Šeduva, the Church of the Invention of the Holy Cross, was built and the parish founded between 1512 and 1529.  The present brick church Cross was built in Šeduva in 1643 with a donation from bishop Jurgis Tiškevičius of Vilnius. During the 18th century the bell tower was added to the structure, with further renovations and extensions in 1905.  Baroque and renaissance architectural styles characterise both the exterior and interior of the church. It has a cruciform plan with an apse, low sacristy and five altars.

During the 15th century the region was redefined as the Voivodeship of Trakai and Vilnius. Later it became part of  the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until the Union of Lublin in 1569 created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The Šeduva coat of arms were granted on June 25, 1654 by John II Casimir Vasa, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania and at the same time the city was granted burger rights at the request of Maria Ludvika, Queen of Poland. She descended from the Princes of Gonzaga, from Mantua in Italy. The arms of the family showed a black eagle. The small breastshield shows the French fleur-de-lis, because the Gonzaga family was related to the French Royal family.  The eagle was made white in reference to the white eagle of Poland.

1792 Stanislaw II August Poniatowski, the last royal proprietor of Šeduva, concluded an agreement with the town's citizens, giving them rights to be excused from labour on the estate for a fee.  In 1795, the year of a terrible fire in Šeduva,  Lithuania became part of Russia when Poland was partitioned.  From 1798, Baron Theodore von Ropp did not acknowledge the rights of Šeduva citizens and required of the citizens to perform labour in the town's manor. The citizens  petitioned for their rights  to the Russian Senate. In 1812, the Senate passed the decision to recognise the former charters of Šeduva.

Between 1696 and 1762, a Jesuit mission, connected with their college at Pašiaušė, was active in the town, operating a lower school with 96 pupils up until 1828.  After an insurrection in 1863 (the January Uprising), all parish schools in Šeduva were closed and replaced by public Russian language schools. In the same year a Russian Orthodox Church, designed by the architect Ustinas Golinevicius, was built and in 1866 a wooden Synagogue was added near the central market square.

The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between Nazi Germany and Communist Russia  in August 1939 and the German-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty a month later placed Lithuania under  Soviet control.   By June 1940 the Soviets had set up a pro-Soviet government and stationed many Red Army troops in Lithuania as part of the Mutual Assistance Pact between the countries. President Antanas Smetona was forced to leave as 15 Red Army divisions came in.

The  pro-Soviet puppet government was controlled by Vladimir Dekanozov and Justas Paleckis, and Lithuania was made part of the  Soviet Union. A Sovietisation programme began immediately. Land, banks and large businesses were nationalised. All religious, cultural, and political organizations were abolished except the Communist party. 17,000 people  were deported to Siberia, where many would perish.

During the years of Lithuanian anti-Soviet partisan resistance (1944–1953) in Šeduva and neighbouring districts Lithuanian Žalioji rinktinė (The Green Squad), belonging to partisans' Algimantas military district was active.

Industry

Šeduva is famous for sheep farming, Lithuanian Black-headed sheep are grown. The state enterprise Šeduvos avininkystė is responsible for the preservation of the genetic stock of Lithuanian Black-Headed sheep.

The Holocaust in Shadeve

The German army invaded Lithuania on 22 June 1941, taking Shadova - Šeduva a few days later as part of Operation Barbarossa. At first the Lithuanian population considered the Nazis to be liberators saving them from the Red Army. Five hundred years of Jewish life in Shadova - Šeduva ended in just two days of slaughter.  Shadova's Jews attempted to flee east to Russia but were badly treated by Lithuanian nationalists and most returned to their homes. The German forces entered Shadova - Šeduva on 25 June 1941 and were received with flowers by many locals.  By the beginning of July, Jews had to wear the yellow Star of David.  Jews who had participated in the  Soviet  rule were immediately arrested and executed.   Jews  were taken to dismantle the remnants of the munitions factory in Linkaičiai, and were then accused of stealing and  executed. Others were forced into labour gangs.  They were set to work cleaning the streets and at the warehouses of the rail station.  All the work was guarded  by armed Lithuanian militi. Next all the Jews of Shadova - Šeduva had to gather in the market place with no more than a small package each, and to hand over the keys to their houses to the police. Under guard, they were escorted at night to the village of Pavartyčiai, five kilometres north-west of Shadova - Šeduva, where they were crowded into two unfinished Soviet barracks surrounded with barbed wire.  The Jews were ordered to hand over all their valuables and cash.  Some were shot in the next few days.

On 25 August 1941 the remaining Jews of Shadova - Šeduva were loaded on trucks and taken to Liaudiškiai, ten kilometres south-west of the town where the Rollcommando Hamann of Einsatzcommando 3 and Lithuanian collaborators of  the 3rd company of the Tautinio Darbo Apsaugos Batalionas were waiting for them.  Over the coming two days the entire Jewish community of Shadova was shot and buried in two pre-prepared mass graves.  One site was located 400 meters north of the Shadova - Šeduva road and a second 900 meters north west of the same road, close to a path in the forest. The lists of mass graves in the book The Popular Massacres of Lithuania, Part II, include the following: Liaudiskiai forest about 10 km southwest of Šeduva, one site 400 meters north of the Šeduva road and a second site 900 meters northwest of the same road, close to a path in the forest. The Jäger report concludes that Einsatzcommando 3 registered the murder in Šeduva on the 25 and 26 August 1941 of 230 Jewish men, 275 Jewish women and 159 Jewish children, a total of 664 people.

"Dominick & Dickerman

Dominick and Dickerman is an investment and merchant banking firm, located in New York City.  From 1899 through 2015, the firm was known as Dominick and Dominick.  Following the sale of the wealth management business, the firm reverted to its original name, Dominick and Dickerman.

The firm was founded in 1870 and is one of the oldest, continuously operated financial services institutions in the United States.  Dominick & Dickerman LLC services its individual and corporate clients primarily through three business divisions: Private Wealth Management, Investment Banking and Institutional Sales.  Private Wealth Management offers wealth management advise, including investment strategies, asset allocation, wealth and estate planning, insurance products and alternative investments.  The Investment Banking team services public and private corporations around the world by raising capital, developing and implementing strategic merger and acquisition plans, and advising senior management teams on a variety of governance, operations and growth issues.  Institutional Sales recommends and executes trading strategies for institutional clients in the United States and abroad.  Dominick & Dominick LLC is headquartered in New York City and has offices in  Basel, Switzerland.  Dominick & Dominick LLC is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

History

Founding
The company was founded on June 15, 1870 as Dominick & Dickerman by William Gayer Dominick and Watson Bradley Dickerman. Dominick was born in Chicago, and moved to New York as a child. In 1869, at the age of 25, he purchased membership on the New York Stock Exchange. At the NYSE, Dominick met Connecticut-born Dickerman and they went into business forming a stock brokerage firm. Dominick's brothers, George and Bayard Dominick, also joined the Exchange and became partners in the firm.

Dominick & Dickerman opened its first branch in 1889 in Cincinnati, where the firm was one of only two exchange members. A year later, Dickerman left the firm when he was elected president of the New York Stock Exchange. He would serve as president from 1890 to 1892, then return to the firm. His cofounder, William Dominick, died in 1895 at the age of 50 to typhoid fever. Dickerman would retire in 1909, passing away at the age of 77 in 1923.

Dominick & Dickerman changed its name in 1899 to Dominick & Dominick, adding several new partners including Milnor B. Dominick, Andrew V. Stout, J.A. Barnard, and Bernon S. Prentice. The firm was one of the original sources for closed-end funds, launching The Dominick fund, Inc in 1920 by selling 200,000 shares for a raise of $10 million. Despite the stock market crash in 1929, the fund survived and was listed in 1959 on the NYSE before it was merged with Putnam Fund in 1973.

Expansion

In 1936 Dominick & Dominick expanded through acquisition, merging with A. Iselin & Co., also one of Wall Street's oldest firms. Several months earlier the patriarch of the firm, Adrian Iselin, died at the age of 89. He had joined the firm, which his father formed, as a 22-year-old in 1868. At the time of the merger, Dominick & Dominick had 13 partners, including Gayer G. Dominick (senior partner since 1926), Bayard Dominick, and Gardner Dominick Stout. It next picked up several partners from Iselin & Co., as well as Iselin Securities Corporation, which brought with it an office in Paris, and the Iselin Corporation of Canada with its office in Montreal. Because Dominick & Dominick already maintained a London office, the London office of Iselin Securities was closed.
Other European offices were subsequently opened, and Dominick & Dominick soon had a presence in all of the major cities in Europe.

World War II

A large number of the firm's employees and partners entered the military, including Gayer Dominick. The firm was content to just keep its doors opened and operate. Gayer Dominick had been with the firm since 1909 after graduating from Yale University. In 1935 he was elected a governor of the New York Stock Exchange and helped to hire the first paid president of the Exchange, at the behest of the new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He then left the family firm in 1938 to enter public service, working for the Office of Price Administration in the Roosevelt administration.

Post-War expansion

After World War II came to an end and following a brief economic recession as the United States reverted to a peacetime footing, the economy enjoyed a long period of growth. Dominick & Dominick benefited from the country's prosperity. Some of the firm's most notable transactions during the postwar years involved Yonkers, New York-based  Alexander Smith Carpet Company and Canada's Great Plains Oil. In the late 1950s Dominick & Dominick was also part of a banking syndicate that managed the initial public offering (IPO) of stock issued by Arvida Corporation, which was formed in Florida in 1958 to sell the real estate holdings of Arthur Vining Davis. The IPO gained attention because of objections raised by the SEC to the way the managers had announced the stock sale before filing a registration statement with the SEC, a violation of the law.

Dominick & Dominick ended registration as a partnership, reorganizing as a corporation in 1964. The 1960s also saw the firm spread its operation across the country, taking advantage of a bull market to build up a domestic retail brokerage business. In 1962 an office in Chicago was opened. Dominick & Dominick gained a major presence in New England in 1966 by acquiring the firm of Townsend, Dabney, Tyson. Not only did the firm pick up a large Boston office but another 15 offices throughout the Northeast. About 30 additional branch offices across the United States were opened by the end of the 1960s.

In 1970 Dominick & Dominick pursued a merger with Clark, Dodge & Co., Inc., a similar size firm, but called it off, electing instead to continue a program of opening new offices and pursuing the acquisition of smaller firms. This plan was also eventually terminated, however, as the stock market began to experience one of the worst bear markets in a generation, and Dominick & Dominick found that it had stretched itself far too thin.

Dark period
Strapped for cash the firm sold four of its five seats on the New York Stock Exchange and one of two seats on the American Stock Exchange. It also sold a significant stake in the business for $7.25 million to an investment group led by Pierce National Life Insurance Company (now Liberty Corporation), which was in turn controlled by Joe L. Allbritton, founder of Allbritton Communications Company. While the infusion of capital was welcome, Dominick & Dominick still found itself in a difficult position and decided to exit the domestic retail brokerage business and to sell the bulk of its branch offices.
The firm's chairman and chief executive, Peter M. Kennedy, explained to the New York Times that ""a national retail structure is not right for a firm of our size. We either had to be bigger or smaller."" He added, ""We are not going out of business. We are just changing the nature of our business.""
Dominick & Dominick retained a modest retail business but mostly chose to focus on core strengths, including institutional business, money management, corporate finance, municipal bonds, and its international business. It was also in 1973 The Dominick fund, which had about $55 million in assets, was taken over by Putnam Fund.

Over the next 20 years, Dominick & Dominick reduced its work force and closed offices in an attempt to focus on more profitable financial services such as research. The firm also became involved in the fixed income area, making corporate and municipal bonds, Eurobonds, and Treasury Notes available to its clients, and launched managed futures programs to participate in the global currency markets. The firm also did a healthy business providing clearing services to more than 100 National Association of Securities Dealers firms; its Dominick & Dominick Advisors unit provided investment and portfolio management services to high-net-worth investors and institutions in the United States, Europe, and Asia.

21st century
By the start of the new century, Dominick & Dominick was in decline and needed an infusion of partner capital. In October 2003 the firm brought in a new president and CEO, hiring 58-year-old Michael J. Campbell, a former Marine who had 30 years of experience in the industry, including a 25-year tenure with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) and a stint with Credit Suisse First Boston after Credit Suisse acquired DLJ. With DLJ Campbell managed the private client group, expanding the firm's high-net-worth and midsized institutional investor brokerage business from 75 advisors to a network of more than 500 investment professionals.

Campbell joined Dominick & Dominick in 2003, bringing senior management from DLJ and Credit Suisse First Boston. The new management relocated the firm headquarters from lower Manhattan to Midtown Manhattan to an office on 52nd St. In addition, Campbell wasted little time in recruiting new advisors from Credit Suisse and other major financial firms.

Dominick & Dominick's first branch office to open under Campbell's management was in the fall of 2004 when an operation in Miami was opened to focus on wealthy Central and South American residents. It was not an acquisition, as Dominick was absorbing the Miami office of Pennsylvania-based First Security Investments, which had been opened by another former DLJ employee, Alain O'Hayon, who stayed on to manage the office. Campbell was very familiar with the potential of a Miami operation, having built up an office in the city for DLJ from just two brokers to more than 70.

In 2006 another regional office was added in Atlanta.

A year later, in 2007, Dominick & Dominick launched a new risk arbitrage group with the hope to develop synergies with the firm's existing institutional and high-net-worth client base.

Stanford Financial Group receivership
On November 13, 2009, the US District Court ordered the Brokerage Accounts of Stanford Financial Group Brokerage to be transferred to Dominick & Dominick LLC. The Stanford Group was the firm run by Allen Stanford. Both Stanford Group Company and Dominick & Dominick LLC use Pershing LLC as their clearing firm. The transfer became effective on January 20, 2010.

"Jordan Morris

Jordan Perry Morris (born October 26, 1994) is an American soccer player who plays as a forward for Seattle Sounders FC in Major League Soccer, and the United States national team.

Club career

Youth, college and amateur
Morris, from Mercer Island, Washington, began his youth career with Eastside FC, where he played from 2004 to 2012, from U11 to U17, with the Eastside FC B94 Red team, coached by Dan Strom, and helped the team to six of its seven Washington State titles as well as two third-place finishes at the US Youth Soccer National Championships in 2011 and 2012: he was named to the Best XI in 2011, and was the Golden Ball winner in 2012. Morris was also named NSCAA Washington State Player of the Year and NSCAA High School All-American in 2012.

He joined the Sounders FC youth academy and played in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy for one season. On February 6, 2012, Morris signed a letter of intent to play college soccer at Stanford University.

In his freshman year with the Cardinal, Morris appeared in all 21 matches and led all Pac-12 freshman with seven assists and 19 points and tied for the lead with six goals and helped lead his team to their first NCAA Tournament since 2009 where they would eventually fall 1–0 to #2 seed Washington in the Round of 16. He went on to be named first team All-Pac-12 that year. Morris also spent time with Seattle Sounders FC U-23 in the Premier Development League.

In his sophomore year, Morris helped lead Stanford to its first Pac-12 championship since 2001.

In his junior year, Morris scored 13 goals and had 3 assists. He led the Cardinal to both the Pac-12 and the NCAA Championships. In the NCAA tournament, Morris scored 5 of Stanford's total of 12 goals. In the championship game against Clemson, Morris scored his first of two goals in the game only 87 seconds into the contest.

On January 8, 2016, Morris was awarded the Hermann Trophy as the best player in NCAA Division I soccer.

Seattle Sounders
After winning the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship, there was speculation that Morris would begin to play professionally. Coach Jürgen Klinsmann stated that Morris ""obviously has to"" turn pro. On January 5, 2016, Morris announced he decided to forgo his senior season at Stanford to turn pro. It was widely speculated that Morris would sign with the Sounders, the club for which his father works, and also holds his amateur rights. On January 21, 2016, Morris signed with Seattle Sounders FC, being given MLS's highest-ever Homegrown Player contract worth roughly $250,000 a year. He joined the Sounders' preseason training camp in Arizona, debuting in a friendly against Celaya F.C. on February 9, 2016. On February 23, 2016, Morris made his professional debut against Club América in the CONCACAF Champions League, starting the match. The following week, he debuted in the Sounders' first Major League Soccer game of the season against Sporting Kansas City.

Morris scored his first Major League Soccer goal for the Sounders on April 16, 2016, against the Philadelphia Union. He then went on to score in his next three consecutive games, matching the Seattle rookie scoring record, his next goal then surpassed the rookie goalscoring record which had been set by Steve Zakuani in 2009. He has since helped his team to win the MLS Cup after a run from ninth place into fourth, along with the help of Nicolas Lodeiro, a new midseason acquisition made by Seattle.

On February 22, 2018 while playing in El Salvador against Santa Tecla in the Sounders' first match of the 2018 CONCACAF Champions League, Morris collapsed untouched in the 85th minute with a torn ACL. He was reported to likely miss 6–9 months. After missing the entirety of the 2018 MLS season, Morris was signed to a five-year contract extension with the Sounders in December 2018.

Werder Bremen trial
On January 5, 2016, it was reported that Morris was set to train with Werder Bremen at their winter camp, which Bremen chief executive Thomas Eichin claimed was ""an opportunity for us to get to know the player better. Nothing more and nothing less"". On January 13, 2016, it was reported that Bremen extended the trial of Morris who then played in a friendly match against Inter Baku PIK and recorded an assist. On January 18, 2016, it was reported that Bremen had offered a contract to Morris, and Eichin claimed he was confident that they would sign him. However, it was later reported by Werder Bremen that Morris had turned down their offer in favor of playing in the United States.

International career

In May 2013, Morris was one of 22 players named to the U.S. under-20 squad for the Toulon Tournament where he made three appearances. He also made appearances for the U.S. under-23 national team on August 6, 2014 and scored in a 5–1 win over Barbados.

On August 28, 2014, Morris received his first senior call up to the U.S. men's national team for a friendly against the Czech Republic, making him the first college player to be called into squad since Chris Albright was called up in 1999 while he was still playing at the University of Virginia. While he was left on the bench, he would make his international debut in a 4–1 defeat to Ireland in November.

On April 15, 2015, he scored his first U.S. men's national team goal against Mexico in an international friendly. In the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup Final, Morris scored the winning goal for the United States, assuring a victory over Jamaica and becoming joint top scorer of the tournament with three goals.

International goals
As of matches played November 19, 2019. Scores and results list the United States's goal tally first.

Personal life
Morris was born in Seattle, Washington, to Michael and Leslie Morris. His father, Dr. Michael Morris, is the chief medical director of Seattle Sounders FC. He has three siblings named Christopher, Julian and Talia. He attended Mercer Island High School, where he played high school soccer prior to joining the Sounders Academy.

Morris was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of nine and is one of the few professional athletes with the condition to play. He said that having diabetes has helped shape him. His tattoo ""T1D"" on his inner arm is a tribute to the armband people with diabetes have to wear.

"Xsan

Xsan () is Apple Inc.'s storage area network (SAN) or clustered file system for macOS. Xsan enables multiple Mac desktop and Xserve systems to access shared block storage over a Fibre Channel network.  With the Xsan file system installed, these computers can read and write to the same storage volume at the same time. Xsan is a complete SAN solution that includes the metadata controller software, the file system client software, and integrated setup, management and monitoring tools.

Xsan has all the normal features to be expected in an enterprise shared disk file system, including support for large files and file systems, multiple mounted file systems, metadata controller failover for fault tolerance, and support for multiple operating systems.

Interoperability

Xsan is based on the StorNext File System made by Quantum Corporation. The StorNext File System and the Xsan file system share the same file system layout and the same protocol when talking to the metadata server. They also seem to share a common code base or very close development based on the new features developed for both file systems.

The Xsan website claims complete interoperability with the StorNext File System: ""And because Xsan is completely interoperable with Quantum’s StorNext File System, you can even provide clients on Windows, Linux, and other UNIX platforms with direct Fibre Channel block-level access to the data in your Xsan-managed storage pool.""

Quantum Corporation claims: ""Complete interoperability with Apple’s Xsan and Promise RAID and Allows Xsan and Xserve RAID to support AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, Red Hat Linux, SuSE Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows clients, including support for 64 Bit Windows and Windows Vista.""

Some of the command line tools for Xsan begin with the letters cv, which stand for CentraVision – the original name for the file system. XSan clients use TCP ports 49152–65535, with TCP/63146 frequently showing in log files.

Data representation
Xsan file system uses several logical storages to distribute information. The two main classes of information appear on Xsan: the user data (such as files) and the file system metadata (such as folders, file names, file allocation information and so on). Most configurations use different storages for data and metadata.
The file system supports dynamic expansion and distribution of both data and metadata areas.

History

On January 4, 2005, Apple announced shipping of Xsan.

In May 2006, Apple released Xsan 1.2 with support for volume sizes of nearly 2 petabytes.

On August 7, 2006, Apple announced Xsan 1.4, which is available for Intel-based Macintosh computers as a Universal binary and supports file system access control lists.

On December 5, 2006, Apple released Xsan 1.4.1.

On October 18, 2007, Apple released Xsan 1.4.2, which resolves several reliability and compatibility issues.

On February 19, 2008, Apple released Xsan 2, the first major update, which introduces MultiSAN, and completely redesigned administration tools. 2.1 was introduced on June 10, 2008. 2.1.1 was introduced on October 15, 2008. 2.2 was released September 14, 2009.

On July 20, 2011, Apple released Xsan 2.3, included in Mac OS X Lion. This was the first version of Xsan included with macOS.

On August 25, 2011, Apple released Xsan 2.2.2, which brought along several reliability fixes.

On July 25, 2012, Apple released Xsan 3, included in OS X Mountain Lion.

On October 17, 2014, Apple released Xsan 4 with OS X Yosemite.

On September 20, 2016, Apple released Xsan 5 with macOS Sierra and macOS Server 5.2.

"Phullu

Phullu is a 2017 Indian drama film directed by  Abhishek Saxena. Produced by Pushpa Chaudhary, Dr. Anmol Kapoor, Kshitij Chaudhary & Raman Kapoor under the Kapoor Film Inc Kc Production Pvt.Ltd banner. The film was released worldwide on June 16, 2017. The film stars Sharib Hashmi, Jyotii Sethi, and Nutan Surya which is inspired from the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social activist from Tamil Nadu. 

Phullu is about Phullu, an errand boy who eventually makes low-cost menstruation pads.

Plot

Phullu  the titular character (portrayed by Sharib Hashmi) that's the typical good guy. Phullu's mother sells quilts because he doesn't have a job. He helps out his mom by procuring all the raw material for the quilts from the nearby town. In addition, he also picks up all the other stuff the women in his village may need from there.

When Phullu gets married, he realises that his wife keeps taking away pieces of red cloth from the material he gathers for the quilts. He wonders about it, but doesn't connect the dots as he knows nothing about menstruation. Neither his wife or mother explain the concept to him.

The women in his life also want Phullu to move to a big city and find work. But he's adamant about staying back in the village.

Finally, a turning point in Phullu's life comes when he finds out about menstruation through a female doctor at a chemist's shop on one of his city visits. He finally begins to understand why his wife needs the cloth, and why she suffers from itching every night.

He then takes rather drastic step of using all the money reserved for the last installment payment for his sister's jewellery to get a whole lot of sanitary pads. His furious mother kicks him out of the house, saying that he's wasted the money she earned with so much difficulty. When he tries to protest that the sanitary napkins are more important, his mother says her grandmother used wood to get rid of the itching and went on to live for 102 years, so pads are irrelevant.

Phullu goes to the city, where he gets in touch with the doctor who'd educated him about menstruation. He manages to create a sanitary napkin of his own. However, his mother and sister refuse to test it, as do the other women in the village for whom he used to run errands in the city. His wife is pregnant at this time, so she can't help him out either but is in how supportive Phullu's wife is, of his endeavour to manufacture low-cost sanitary napkins.

"KTLO-FM

KTLO-FM 97.9 FM is a radio station licensed to Mountain Home, Arkansas. The station broadcasts an Adult Standards format and is owned by Mountain Lakes Broadcasting Corp.

History

On January 7, 1969, Mountain Home Broadcasting Corporation, the owner of KTLO (1240 AM), filed with the Federal Communications Commission to build a new FM radio station in Mountain Home. The construction permit was granted on July 1, 1970, and KTLO-FM began broadcasting at 98.3 MHz on January 11, 1971. $30,000 in new equipment was installed at the KTLO studios on Highway 5 to prepare for the launch of the stereo outlet. KTLO-FM broadcast from a hilltop tower located west of the studios and AM transmitter site. Early FM programming was in a block format, with contemporary and country music interspersed with news features. KTLO-AM-FM was sold in 1975 to four new investors for $400,000.

By the mid-1980s, KTLO had settled into a middle-of-the-road music format known as ""Stardust 98"". The 1990s saw ownership and technical changes for KTLO-FM. The former began with a $775,000 sale of KTLO-AM-FM to Charles and Scottie Earls in late 1994. The Earls oversaw a major technical overhaul for the FM outlet: in 1996, it increased its power to 50,000 watts and relocated to 97.9 MHz from a transmitter on Crystal Mountain, with the programming remaining the same. The Earls divested their remaining shares in KTLO-AM-FM and KCTT-FM 101.7 to the Ward and Knight families in 2010 in a transaction that gave the Earls full control of KOMC-FM and KRZK in Branson, Missouri; the two families had previously been minority owners in Mountain Lakes.

Among KTLO-FM's regular programs is Talk of the Town, an interview show. Talk of the Town had previously been hosted by Brenda Nelson, who retired after 34 years on air in 2009 after airing some 8,000 interviews.

"Cummings Machine Works

Cummings Machine Works was a Boston, Massachusetts based business. It was founded by Henry Havelock Cummings in 1881, when Cummings was 23 years old. The company was awarded a United States Defense Department contract to manufacture fixtures in March 1941. The contract amounted to $17,893. The company was among the firms which contributed to the building of the Boston Opera House, completed in 1909, supplying steelworks used in the construction of the stage.

Cummings Machine Works has been credited with the development of the sally saw. A patent filed in 1945, and assigned to the company, describes a saw with a circular blade. The blade could be rotated between horizontal and vertical, thus allowing a tree to be felled, limbed, and bucked with one saw. Other inventions included a hydraulic hospital bed, automatic doughnut machine, teardrop vehicle and Hookups.

Last owners were Robert M. Mustard, Sr., Pres., and Lewis W. Mustard, Treas. Last known address was 10 Melcher Street in Boston, MA. Went out of business in 1958.

"1942 Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks football team

The 1942 Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks football team represented the United States Navy pre-flight aviation training school at the University of Iowa as an independent during the 1942 college football season. The team compiled a 7–3 record and outscored opponents by a total of 211 to 121. The 1942 team was known for its difficult schedule, including Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, Minnesota, Indiana, Nebraska, and Missouri. The team was ranked No. 2 among the service teams in a poll of 91 sports writers conducted by the Associated Press.

The Navy's pre-flight aviation training school opened on April 15, 1942, with a 27-minute ceremony during which Iowa Governor George A. Wilson turned over certain facilities at the University of Iowa to be used for the training of naval aviators. At the time, Wilson said, ""We are glad it is possible to place the facilities of this university and all the force and power of the state of Iowa in a service that is today most vital to safeguarding our liberties."" The first group of 600 air cadets was schedule to arrive on May 28.

Bernie Bierman, then holding the rank of major, was placed in charge of the physical conditioning program at the school. Bieman had been the head coach of Minnesota from 1932 to 1941 and served as the head coach of the Iowa Pre-Flight team in 1942. Larry Snyder, previously the track coach at Ohio State, was assigned as Bierman's assistant.  Don Heap, Dallas Ward, Babe LeVoir, and Trevor Reese were assigned as assistant coaches for the football team.

In June 1942, Bierman addressed the ""misconception"" that the Iowa pre-flight school was ""merely a place for varsity athletics."" He said: ""Our purpose here is to turn out the toughest bunch of flyers the world has ever seen and not first class athletes.""

Two Seahawks were named to the 1942 All-Navy All-America football team: George Svendsen at center and Dick Fisher at left halfback. In addition, Bill Kolens (right tackle), Judd Ringer (right end), George Benson (quarterback), and Bill Schatzer (left halfback) were named to the 1942 All-Navy Preflight Cadet All-America team.

"Frithy and Chadacre Woods

Frithy and Chadacre Woods is a 28.7 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in the parishes of Lawshall and Shimpling in Suffolk, England.

Description
Three ancient and semi-natural woods form the SSSI, namely Frithy Wood in Lawshall parish and Ashen Wood and Bavins Wood on the Chadacre Estate in Shimpling parish.

All three woods are of the wet ash (Fraxinus excelsior) / maple (Acer campestre) type, with hazel (Corylus avellana) also present in considerable quantity. There are pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) trees and other tree and shrub species include aspen (Populus tremula), wild cherry (Prunus avium), midland hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), crab apple (Malus sylvestris), holly (Ilex aquifolium), spindle (Euonymus europaeus) and common dogwood (Cornus sanguinea). The structure of the woods has been greatly influenced by management of the coppice.

The three woods have a diverse woodland floor vegetation, which is dominated by either dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis) or brambles (Rubus spp.). They contain a number of plants characteristic of woodlands of this type including herb paris (Paris quadrifolia) in Ashen Wood and wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides), woodruff (Galium odoratum), sanicle (Sanicula europaea) and stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) in Frithy Wood. The SSSI lies within the distribution of oxlip (Primula elatior) and all three woods contain this species. There are many other woodland floor plants including early purple orchid (Orchis mascula), twayblade (Neottia ovata), gromwell (Lithospermum officinale) and bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scriptus).

There are several well-vegetated rides in the group of woods that support a mixture of woodland and meadow plant species and which attract considerable numbers of common butterflies. Frithy Wood also contains an area of pasture which projects into the wood which is partly shaded by a number of standard trees.

The birdlife of Frithy Wood has been recorded in detail with species including the nightingale, European green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker and lesser spotted woodpecker which breed regularly.

Roe deer, fallow deer and muntjac can also be seen in the woods but they have caused considerable damage to the ground vegetation.

Forest school
Forest school sessions are held in Frithy Wood by permission of the landowners.  The 'school' represents an initiative of All Saints Primary School, Lawshall and the Green Light Trust, an environmental and educational charity.

History
Oliver Rackham has stated that ""a wood now called The Frith is almost certain to be pre-conquest, from Old English Fyrhp.""  In a later book he stated that ""an Anglo-Saxon (parallel) is fyrth, a wood, which has given rise to many Frith or Frithy Woods.""  

There is documentary evidence for the existence of Frithy (formerly Frith) Wood back to 1545 and its Saxon name would imply that the wood is much older than that.  All three woods are part of ancient woodland and contain broad boundary banks and ditches typical of coppice woods dating from the medieval period or before.

In more recent times in the twentieth century pigs were kept in Frithy Wood and at one time the wood extended as far as The Street.

Newspaper records
On 31 August 1921 it was reported in the Suffolk Free Press that the remains of George Nunn aged 55 of Lawshall were discovered hanging in Frithy Wood. He had been missing for around 4 months since 22 April and was found a short distance from where he lived.

Access
The woods are not private with easy access.

"Hugh Lucas-Tooth

Sir Hugh Vere Huntly Duff Munro-Lucas-Tooth, 1st Baronet (13 January 1903 – 18 November 1985), born and baptised Hugh Vere Huntly Duff Warrand and known as Sir Hugh Vere Huntly Duff Lucas-Tooth, 1st Baronet, from 1920 to 1965, was a Scottish British Conservative politician. Elected to parliament in 1924 at the age of 21, he was the first British MP to have been born in the 20th century.

Family
Warrand's father was Hugh Munro Warrand (8 July 1870 – 11 June 1935, married 24 April 1901), Major in the 3rd Battalion of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and son of Alexander John Cruikshank Warrand of Bught, Inverness-shire.

Warrand's mother Beatrice Maude Lucas Lucas-Tooth (died 25 June 1944) was a daughter of Sir Robert Lucas-Tooth, 1st Baronet. Warrand's great-grandfather was Robert Tooth, a prominent Australian businessman. His brother Selwyn John Power Warrand (6 February 1904 – 24 May 1941), who married 25 March 1933 to Frena Lingen Crace, daughter of Everard Crace, from Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, by whom he had two children.

Selwyn John Power Warrand was a Commander in the service of the Royal Navy, fought in World War II and was killed in action on board of HMS Hood (51) and his widow remarried in 1947 Henry Richard Charles Humphries. His sister Beatrice Helen Fitzhardinge Warrand (born 1908), married on 27 September 1941 another World War II veteran, Lieutenant Colonel Lyndall Fownes Urwick, Military Cross, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, son of Sir Henry Urwick of Malvern, Worcestershire, Justice of the Peace.

Biography
Warrand was educated at Eton College, and graduated from Balliol College in 1924 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He adopted the legally changed name Hugh Vere Huntly Duff Lucas-Tooth of Teanich by Royal Licence in 1920 when he gained the recreated baronetcy of his maternal grandfather, the first baronet, whose three sons had died in World War I, being created 1st Baronet Lucas-Tooth, of Bught, County Inverness, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 1 December 1920, with special remainder to the heirs male of the body of his mother.

Lucas-Tooth was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1924 general election as Conservative Member of Parliament for the Isle of Ely from October 1924 to May 1929. Aged 21, he became the youngest MP, known as ""Baby of the House"". He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Arthur Samuel, Secretary for Overseas Trade. Lucas-Tooth was called to the bar in 1933 at Lincoln's Inn entitled to practise as a barrister. He also became a lieutenant colonel in the service of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders.

During the 1930s Lucas-Tooth helped established the Lucas-Tooth gymnasium at Tooley Street in south London for the benefit of unemployed men from the Northern coalfields and unemployed areas. A new style of physical exercises helped improve the fitness of these men. It was featured in a British Pathe newsreel in 1938 titled 'Fit – Fitter – Fittest'.

He was defeated in the 1929 general election by the Liberal candidate, James A. de Rothschild. Lucas-Tooth stood again for parliament in the 1945 general election for Hendon South, and was elected, taking his seat in July 1945. He retained the seat in subsequent general elections until 1970 and was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department between February 1952 and December 1955.

On 3 February 1965 Lucas-Tooth legally changed his name once again by Deed Poll to Hugh Vere Huntly Duff Munro-Lucas-Tooth of Teaninich, to reflect the Scottish lairdship Munro of Teaninich.

He retired from Parliament at the 1970 general election.

Marriage and issue
He married on 10 September 1925 Laetitia Florence Findlay (died 1978), daughter of Sir John Ritchie Findlay, 1st Baronet, of Aberlour; the couple had three children, Laetitia (born 1926), Jennifer (born 1929), and Hugh (born 1932). Hugh succeeded his father as Baronet.

"Helderberg Escarpment

The Helderberg Escarpment, also known as the Helderberg Mountains, is an escarpment and mountain range in eastern New York, United States, roughly  west of the city of Albany.  The escarpment rises steeply from the Hudson Valley below, with an elevation difference of approximately 700 feet (from 400 to 1,100 feet) over a horizontal distance of approximately 2,000 feet. Much of the escarpment is within John Boyd Thacher State Park, and has views of the Hudson Valley and the Albany area.

Geology

The escarpment is geologically related to three other escarpments, the Niagara Escarpment,
the Black River Escarpment, and the Onondaga Escarpment.
The rocks exposed in the escarpment date back to the Middle Ordovician to Early Devonian.

In 1934 the Schenectady Gazette described how the Tory Cave, one of the limestone caves to be found in the escarpment, routinely had stalagmites of ice in the springtime.

Transmission towers
Most of the Capital District's television stations installed their transmission towers at the escarpment to take advantage of its high ground. In 2003 a  tower was built on the highest point of the escarpment, for transmitting digital television signals.

History
Dutch settlers first homesteaded the plateau above the escarpment in the 17th century. Helderberg is a Dutch name meaning ""clear mountain"".

The Open Space Institute and the Mohawk Hudson Land Conservancy are working to keep escarpment lands from being developed for housing or industrial uses.
Farmers farming land near the escarpment can apply to sell their development rights, to help make sure that land is not developed. In 2003 the Ten Eyck family, owners of the Indian Ladder Farm just below the escarpment, sold the development rights to their farm for $848,000.  Two real estate assessment were done, one on the value of the property as a working farm, the other on its value as a potential site for urban development.  The Ten Eycks were paid the difference in return for agreeing to keep the property as a working farm. They were the first property owners to sell their development rights in Albany County.

"Direct-shift gearbox

A direct-shift gearbox (), commonly abbreviated to DSG, is an electronically controlled dual-clutch multiple-shaft gearbox in a transaxle design, with automatic clutch operation and with fully automatic or semi-manual gear selection. The first actual dual-clutch transmissions were derived from Porsche in-house development for their Model 962 racing cars in the 1980s.

In simple terms, a DSG automates two separate ""manual"" gearboxes (and clutches) contained within one housing and working as one unit. It was designed by BorgWarner and is licensed to the Volkswagen Group, with support by IAV GmbH. By using two independent clutches, a DSG can achieve faster shift times and eliminates the torque converter of a conventional epicyclic automatic transmission.

Overview

Transverse DSG
At the time of launch in 2003, it became the world's first automated dual-clutch transmission in a series-production car, in the German-market Volkswagen Golf Mk4 R32, and shortly afterwards worldwide, in the original Audi TT 3.2. and the 2004+ New Beetle TDI. For the first few years of production, this original DSG transmission was only available in transversely oriented front-engine, front-wheel-drive and Haldex Traction-based four-wheel-drive vehicle layouts.

The first DSG transaxle that went into production for the Volkswagen Group mainstream marques had six forward speeds (and one reverse) and used wet/submerged multi-plate clutch packs (Volkswagen Group internal code: DQ250, parts code prefix: 02E). It has been paired to engines with up to  of torque. The two-wheel-drive version weighs .  It is manufactured at Volkswagen Group's Kassel plant, with a daily production output of 1,500 units.

At the start of 2008, another world-first  seven-speed DSG transaxle (Volkswagen Group internal code: DQ200, parts code prefix: 0AM) became available.  It differs from the six-speed DSG, in that it uses two single-plate dry clutches (of similar diameter). This clutch pack was designed by LuK Clutch Systems, Gmbh. This seven-speed DSG is used in smaller front-wheel-drive cars with smaller-displacement engines with lower torque outputs, such as the latest Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Polo Mk5, and the new SEAT Ibiza. It has been paired to engines with up to . It has considerably less oil capacity than the six-speed DQ250; this new DQ200 uses just  of transmission fluid.

In September 2010, VW launched a new seven-speed DSG built to support up to , the DQ500.

Audi longitudinal DSG
In late 2008, an all-new seven-speed longitudinal S tronic version of the DSG transaxle went into series production (Volkswagen Group internal code: DL501, parts code prefix: 0B5). Initially, from early 2009, it is only used in certain Audi cars, and only with longitudinally mounted engines. Like the original six-speed DSG, it features a concentric dual wet multi-plate clutch. However, this particular variant uses notably more plates – the larger outer clutch (for the odd-numbered gears) uses 10 plates, whereas the smaller inner clutch (driving even-numbered gears and reverse) uses 12 plates. Another notable change over the original transverse DSGs is the lubrication system  – Audi now utilise two totally separate oil circuits. One oil circuit, consisting of , lubricates the hydraulic clutches and mechatronics with fully synthetic specialist automatic transmission fluid (ATF), whilst the other oil circuit lubricates the gear trains and front and centre differentials with  of conventional hypoid gear oil. This dual circuit lubrication is aimed at increasing overall reliability, due to eliminating cross-contamination of debris and wear particles. It has a torque handling limit of up to , and engine power outputs of up to . It has a total mass, including all lubricants and the dual-mass flywheel of .

This was initially available in their quattro all-wheel-drive variants, and is very similar to the new ZF Friedrichshafen-supplied Porsche Doppel-Kupplung (PDK).

List of DSG variants

Operational introduction
The internal combustion engine drives two clutch packs. The outer clutch pack drives gears 1, 3, 5 (and 7 when fitted), and reverse – the outer clutch pack has a larger diameter compared to the inner clutch, and can therefore handle greater torque loadings. The inner clutch pack drives gears 2, 4, and 6. Instead of a standard large dry single-plate clutch, each clutch pack for the six-speed DSG is a collection of four small wet interleaved clutch plates (similar to a motorcycle wet multi-plate clutch). Due to space constraints, the two clutch assemblies are concentric, and the shafts within the gearbox are hollow and also concentric. Because the alternate clutch pack's gear-sets can be pre-selected (predictive shifts enabled via the unloaded section of the gearbox), un-powered time while shifting is avoided because the transmission of torque is simply switched from one clutch-pack to the other. While the DSG has one of the fastest shift times on the market, the claim that the DSG takes only about 8 milliseconds to upshift is un-proven with 3-party data nor claimed by the manufacturer.

DSG controls
The direct-shift gearbox uses a floor-mounted transmission shift lever, very similar to that of a conventional automatic transmission. The lever is operated in a straight 'fore and aft' plane (without any 'dog-leg' offset movements), and uses an additional button to help prevent an inadvertent selection of an inappropriate shift lever position.

P 
P position of the floor-mounted gear shift lever means that the transmission is set in park.  Both clutch packs are fully disengaged, all gear-sets are disengaged, and a solid mechanical transmission lock is applied to the crown wheel of the DSG's internal differential.  This position must only be used when the motor vehicle is stationary.  Furthermore, this is the position which must be set on the shift lever before the vehicle ignition key can be removed.

N 
N position of the floor-mounted shift lever means that the transmission is in neutral. Similar to P above, both clutch packs and all gear-sets are fully disengaged; however, the parking lock is also disengaged.

D mode
Whilst the motor vehicle is stationary and in neutral (N), the driver can select D for drive (after first pressing the foot brake pedal). The transmission's reverse gear is selected on the first shaft K1, and the outer clutch K2 engages at the start of the bite point. At the same time, on the alternate gear shaft, the reverse gear clutch K1 is also selected (pre-selected), as the gearbox doesn't know whether the driver wants to go forward or reverse. The clutch pack for second gear (K2) gets ready to engage. When the driver releases the brake pedal, the K2 clutch pack increases the clamping force, allowing the second gear to take up the drive through an increase of the bite point, and thereby transferring the torque from the engine through the transmission to the drive shafts and road wheels, causing the vehicle to move forward. Depressing the accelerator pedal engages the clutch and causes an increase of forward vehicle speed. Pressing the throttle pedal to the floor (hard acceleration) will cause the gearbox to ""kick down"" to first gear to provide the acceleration associated with first, although there will be a slight hesitation while the gearbox deselects second gear and selects first gear. As the vehicle accelerates, the transmission's computer determines when the second gear (which is connected to the second clutch) should be fully used. Depending on the vehicle speed and amount of engine power being requested by the driver (determined by the position of the throttle pedal), the DSG then up-shifts. During this sequence, the DSG disengages the first outer clutch whilst simultaneously engaging the second inner clutch (all power from the engine is now going through the second shaft), thus completing the shift sequence. This sequence in a fraction of a second (aided by pre-selection), and can happen even with full throttle opening, and as a result, there is minimal power loss.

Once the vehicle has completed the shift to second gear, the first gear is immediately de-selected, and third gear (being on the same shaft as 1st and 5th) is pre-selected, and is pending. Once the time comes to shift into 3rd, the second clutch disengages and the first clutch re-engages. This method of operation continues in the same manner for the remaining forward gears.

Downshifting is similar to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600 milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the throttle so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear shaft speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a lower gear on the shaft not in use, and then completes the downshift.

The actual shift points are determined by the DSG's transmission ECU, which commands a hydro-mechanical unit. The transmission ECU, combined with the hydro-mechanical unit, are collectively called a mechatronics unit or module. Because the DSG's ECU uses fuzzy logic, the operation of the DSG is said to be adaptive; that is, the DSG will ""learn"" how the user drives the car, and will progressively tailor the shift points accordingly to suit the habits of the driver.

In the vehicle instrument display, between the speedometer and tachometer, the available shift-lever positions are shown, the current position of the shift-lever is highlighted (emboldened), and the current gear ratio in use is also displayed as a number.

Under ""normal"", progressive and linear acceleration and deceleration, the DSG shifts in a sequential manner; i.e., under acceleration: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th → 5th → 6th, and the same sequence reversed for deceleration. However, the DSG can also skip the normal sequential method, by missing gears, and shift two or more gears. This is most apparent if the car is being driven at sedate speeds in one of the higher gears with a light throttle opening, and the accelerator pedal is then pressed down, engaging the kick-down function. During kick-down, the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and throttle opening. This kick-down may be engaged by any increased accelerator pedal opening, and is completely independent of the additional resistance to be found when the pedal is pressed fully to the floor, which will activate a similar kick-down function when in Manual operation mode. The seven-speed unit in the 2007 Audi variants will not automatically shift to 6th gear; rather, it stays at 5th to keep power available at a high RPM while cruising.

When the floor-mounted gear selector lever is in position D, the DSG works in fully automatic mode, with emphasis placed on gear shifts programmed to deliver maximum fuel economy. That means that shifts will change up and down very early in the rev-range. As an example, on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 GTI, sixth gear will be engaged around , when initially using the DSG transmission with the default ECU adaptation; although with an ""aggressive"" or ""sporty"" driving style, the adaptive shift pattern will increase the vehicle speed at which sixth gear engages.

S mode 
The floor selector lever also has an S position. When S is selected, sport mode is activated in the DSG. Sport mode still functions as a fully automatic mode, identical in operation to D mode, but upshifts and downshifts are made much higher up the engine rev-range. This aids a more sporty driving manner, by utilising considerably more of the available engine power, and also maximising engine braking. However, this mode does have a detrimental effect on the vehicle fuel consumption, when compared to D mode. This mode may not be ideal to use when wanting to drive in a sedate manner; nor when road conditions are very slippery, due to ice, snow or torrential rain – because loss of tire traction may be experienced (wheel spin during acceleration, and may also result in road wheel locking during downshifts at high engine rpms under closed throttle). On 4motion or quattro-equipped vehicles this may be partially offset by the drivetrain maintaining full-time engagement of the rear differential in S mode, so power distribution under loss of front-wheel traction may be marginally improved.

S is highlighted in the instrument display, and like D mode, the currently used gear ratio is also displayed as a number.

R 
R position of the floor-mounted shift lever means that the transmission is in reverse.  This functions in a similar way to D, but there is just one reverse gear. When selected, R is highlighted in the instrument display.

Manual mode
Additionally, the floor shift lever also has another plane of operation, for manual mode, with spring-loaded + and − positions. This plane is selected by moving the stick away from the driver (in vehicles with the driver's seat on the right, the lever is pushed to the left, and in left-hand drive cars, the stick is pushed to the right) when in D mode only. When this plane is selected, the DSG can now be controlled like a manual gearbox, albeit only under a sequential shift pattern.

In most (VW) applications, the readout in the instrument display changes to 6 5 4 3 2 1, and just like the automatic modes, the currently used gear ratio is highlighted or emboldened. In other versions (e.g., on the Audi TT) the display shows just M followed by the gear currently selected; e.g., M1, M2, etc.

To change up a gear, the lever is pushed forward (against a spring pressure) towards the +, and to change down, the lever is pulled rearward towards the −. The DSG transmission can now be operated with the gear changes being (primarily) determined by the driver. This method of operation is commonly called tiptronic. In the interests of engine preservation, when accelerating in Manual/tiptronic mode, the DSG will still automatically change up just before the redline, and when decelerating, it will change down automatically at very low revs, just before the engine idle speed (tickover). Furthermore, if the driver calls for a gear when it is not appropriate (e.g., requesting a downshift when engine speed is near the redline) the DSG will not change to the driver's requested gear.

Current variants of the DSG will still downshift to the lowest possible gear ratio when the kick-down button is activated during full throttle whilst in manual mode. In Manual mode this kick-down is only activated by an additional button at the bottom of the accelerator pedal travel; unless this is pressed the DSG will not downshift, and will simply perform a full-throttle acceleration in whatever gear was previously being utilised.

Paddle shifters
Initially available on certain high-powered cars, and those with a ""sporty"" trim level – such as those using the 2.0 T FSI and 3.2/3.6 VR6 engines – steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters were available. However, these are now being offered (either as a standard inclusive fitment, or as a factory optional extra) on virtually all DSG-equipped cars, throughout all model ranges, including lesser power output applications, such as the 105 PS Volkswagen Golf Plus.

These operate in an identical manner as the floor mounted shift lever when it is placed across the gate in manual mode. The paddle shifters have two distinct advantages: the driver can safely keep both hands on the steering wheel when using the Manual/tiptronic mode; and the driver can temporarily manually override either of the automatic programmes (D or S), and gain instant manual control of the DSG transmission (within the above described constraints).

If the paddle-shift activated manual override of one of the automatic modes (D or S) is used intermittently the DSG transmission will default back to the previously selected automatic mode after a predetermined duration of inactivity of the paddles, or when the vehicle becomes stationary. Alternatively, should the driver wish to immediately revert to fully automatic control, this can be done by activating and holding the + paddle for at least two seconds.

Advantages and disadvantages

Advantages 
Better fuel economy (up to 15% improvement) than conventional planetary geared automatic transmission (due to lower parasitic losses from oil churning) and for some models with manual transmissions;
No loss of torque through the transmission from the engine to the driving wheels during gear shifts;
Short up-shift time of 8 milliseconds when shifting to a gear the alternate gear shaft has preselected;
Smooth gear-shift operations;
Consistent down-shift time of 600 milliseconds, regardless of throttle or operational mode;

Disadvantages 
Unreliable: By design, it is not possible to make it as reliable as a conventional torque-converter automatic transmission.  The slipping clutch mechanism has a limited lifespan;
Marginally worse overall mechanical efficiency compared to a conventional manual transmission, especially on wet-clutch variants (due to electronics and hydraulic systems);
Expensive specialist transmission fluids/lubricants with dedicated additives are required, which need regular changes;
Relatively expensive to manufacture, and therefore increases new vehicle purchase price;
Relatively lengthy shift time when shifting to a gear ratio which the transmission control unit did not anticipate (around 1100 ms, depending on the situation);
Torque handling capability constraints perceive a limit on after-market engine tuning modifications (though many tuners and users may exceed the official torque limits notwithstanding); (Later variants have been fitted to more powerful cars, such as the 300 bhp/350 Nm VW R36 and the 272 bhp/350 Nm Audi TTS.)
Heavier than a comparable Getrag conventional manual transmission ( vs. );
While the first generation DSG fuel economy was up to 15% worse than a manual, the second generation DSG (current) gets better fuel economy than the manual transmission.

Problems and recalls of DSG-equipped vehicles
The 7-speed DQ200 and 6-speed DQ250 gearboxes sometimes suffer from power-loss (gear disengaging) due to short-circuiting of wires caused by a build-up of sulphur in the transmission oil.

United States of America
In August 2009, Volkswagen of America issued two recalls of DSG-equipped vehicles. The first involved 13,500 vehicles, and was to address unplanned shifts to the neutral gear, while the second involved similar problems (by then attributed to faulty temperature sensors) and applied to 53,300 vehicles. These recalls arose as a result of investigations carried out by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), where owners reported to the NHTSA a loss of power whilst driving. This investigation preliminary found only 2008 and 2009 model year vehicles as being affected.

Australia
In November 2009, Volkswagen recalled certain Golf, Jetta, EOS, Passat & Caddy models equipped with 6-speed DQ250 DSG transmission because the gearbox may read the clutch temperature incorrectly, which leads to clutch protection mode, causing a loss of power.

China
Since 2009 there have been widespread concerns from Chinese consumers particularly among the online community, who expressed that Volkswagen has failed to respond to complaints about defects in its DSG-equipped vehicles. Typical issues associated with 6-speed DSG include abnormal noise and inability to change gear; while issues associated with 7-speed DSG include abnormal noise, excessive shift shock, abnormal increase in engine RPM, flashing gear indicator on the dashboard as well as inability to shift to even-numbered gears. In March 2012 China's quality watchdog the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said that it had been in contact with Volkswagen (China) and urged the carmaker to probe the issues. In a survey held by Gasgoo.com (China) of 2,937 industry experts and insiders, 83% of respondents believed that the carmaker should consider a full vehicle recall. In March 2012 Volkswagen Group China admitted that there could be an issue in its seven-speed DSG gearboxes that may affect approximately 500,000 vehicles from its various subsidiaries in China. A software upgrade has since been offered for the affected vehicles in an attempt to repair the problem.

According to 163.com - one of China's most popular web portals - in March 2012 about a quarter of the complaints about problems found in cars in China's automotive market were made against DSG-equipped vehicles manufactured by Volkswagen. The top five models that dominate those complaints were:
 Volkswagen Magotan - 6%
 Volkswagen Bora - 5.3%
 Volkswagen Sagitar - 5.3%
 Volkswagen Touareg - 4.7%
 Volkswagen Golf - 4%

Would be worth noting that Touareg has never been fitted with a DSG transmission.

On 15 March 2013, China Central Television aired a program for the World Consumer Rights Day. The program criticized the issue associated with DSG-equipped vehicles manufactured by Volkswagen. On 17 March 2013 Volkswagen Group China announced on its official Weibo that it will voluntarily recall vehicles equipped with DSG boxes. Some sources have estimated the failure rate of DSG-equipped vehicles sold in China to be greater than 20,000 per million sold.

Sweden
VW Sweden stopped selling the Passat EcoFuel DSG as a taxi after many cars had problems with the 7 speed DSG gearbox. They instead offered the Touran EcoFuel DSG, which is using an updated version of the same DSG gearbox.

Japan
The recall has been extended to Japan with 91,000 (VW and Audi using the same DSG) being recalled.

Malaysia
13 days after the Singapore recall, Volkswagen Malaysia also announced a recall for the 7-speed DSG. No official statement was released by the company, but it was stated that a total of 3,962 were involved in the unit recall exercise - units produced between June 2010 and June 2011, with affected vehicles being Golf, Polo, Scirocco, Cross Touran, Passat and Jetta models equipped with the transmission.

Worldwide recall
14 November 2013, Volkswagen Group announced a major worldwide recall over problems with the 7-speed DSG gearbox (model: DQ200) which might lead to loss of power, covering some 1.6m cars including those carrying the Audi, Skoda and SEAT badges.  Overall, once above 100k miles, repair may be needed immediately whenever strong vibration or gear up-shift/down-shift hesitation is detected.

Australian recall
15 October 2019, Australia recall of DSG 7-speed gearboxes.
Due to a production fault, over time a crack in the transmissions pressure accumulator can occur.
If the pressure accumulator cracks, oil and pressure is lost in the hydraulic system of the gearbox. As a result, the transmission of engine power via the gearbox is interrupted. The experience of this symptom would be comparable to depressing the clutch in a vehicle fitted with a manual transmission. This could increase the likelihood of an accident affecting the occupants of the vehicle and other road users.

"Stern John

Stern John, CM (born 30 October 1976) is a Trinidadian football manager and former player who is currently managing Central F.C. in the TT Pro League. He previously played for a number of American and English football clubs that included Columbus Crew, Bristol City, Nottingham Forest, Birmingham City, Sunderland, Southampton, Crystal Palace, Coventry City and Derby County.

Club career

Early Career in US
John was born in Tunapuna, Trinidad and Tobago and moved to the United States to attend Mercer County Community College in 1995. He joined the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer (MLS) from the now-defunct New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers of the A-League for the 1998 season. On the recommendation of his older cousin, Columbus Crew defender and Trinidad and Tobago international, Ansil Elcock, John received a try-out with Crew, where he became one of the most prolific scorers in league history. In 1998, John led the league with 26 goals, a record that currently puts him tied for fifth in MLS for goals in one season, and also with 57 points to be named the MLS Scoring Champion. He was named to the MLS Best XI that year as well, and tied for the lead with 18 goals in 1999.

Nottingham Forest
After the 1999 season with Columbus, John was acquired by Nottingham Forest of the English First Division for a fee of £1.5 million. However, eventual financial difficulties at Forest following the team's failed bid at promotion forced John's sale to Birmingham City in February 2002, then pushing for promotion to the Premier League, for the sum of £100,000. John scored 18 goals in 49 starts for Forest.

Birmingham City
At Birmingham, John rarely played, although he had some memorable moments in the blue shirt of Birmingham, such as his turn and finish away at West Ham in 2002; his last minute equaliser at Villa Park in the Birmingham derby; and his last minute goal away at Millwall which put Birmingham through to the Playoff Final in 2002. He then scored one of the penalties in the play-off final shootout to help them get promoted to the Premier League. Popular with the Birmingham fans for his crucial and sometimes brilliant goals, he nonetheless fell out of favour with management, and was sold to Coventry City on 14 September 2004.

Coventry City
In his first season with Coventry, John finished second in team scoring with 12 goals despite starting in barely half of Coventry's games.

Derby County

At the start of the 2005–06 season, following the signing of James Scowcroft, John found himself outside of manager Micky Adams's first-team plans. As a result, he was loaned to Derby County on 16 September 2005. He rejoined Coventry three months later.

Sunderland
On 29 January 2007, John was transferred to Sunderland for an undisclosed fee. The signing was Sunderland manager Roy Keane's sixth signing of the 2006–07 season January transfer window. He scored his first goals against Southend United in a 4–0 victory on 17 February 2007.

Southampton
On 29 August 2007, John moved to Southampton as part of a deal that took his international teammate Kenwyne Jones in the opposite direction.

He scored his first goals with two in a 3–2 win against West Bromwich Albion on 6 October 2007. From then on he scored regularly for ""The Saints"", with nine goals in his first fifteen appearances, including a second half hat trick against Hull City on 8 December 2007. He finished the 2007–08 season fourth highest scorer in the Championship with 19 goals for Southampton. (He had also scored once for Sunderland in the Premier League prior to his transfer.) Before being sent off for a second bookable offence, John scored two goals, including the match winner, in Southampton's final game of the season against Sheffield United, as the Saints narrowly avoided relegation to League One.

Bristol City

John was loaned to Bristol City in October 2008 until the end of the 2008–09 season. John made his first Bristol City appearance, coming on as a substitute, against Barnsley in a 0–0 draw. John scored his first goal for Bristol City in a 4–1 defeat to Reading at Ashton Gate Stadium on 1 November 2008.

Crystal Palace
On 29 July 2009 John signed for Crystal Palace on a year-long deal after turning down an offer to stay at Southampton. He made his debut on the opening day of the season against Plymouth Argyle, he had to come off after 35 minutes due to an injury. He returned in mid-October, but joined Ipswich Town on a one-month loan at the end of November. He scored his first goal for Ipswich in a 3–2 win over Coventry City on 16 January 2010. Upon his return to Palace he scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 win at Watford on 30 March 2010.
New Palace manager George Burley had hoped to discuss the player's future at the end of the season, but no discussion occurred, and John left the club.

Solihull Moors
In August 2012, after two seasons out of English football, John returned, signing for Solihull Moors. However, as of November 2012, he had yet to make an appearance in any competition for the club.

WASA FC
John retired and moved back to his native Trinidad and Tobago after his spell at Solihull Moors. He came out of retirement a second time in order to join WASA FC of the National Super League of Trinidad and Tobago in January 2014. He scored on his debut

Central F.C.
John came out of retirement once again in 2016 when he was appointed as player-coach of Central F.C. in the TT Pro League.

International career
John made his international debut for Trinidad and Tobago national football team on 15 February 1995 against Finland in a Friendly match at the Queen's Park Oval, scoring one goal on his debut. John has been a vital player for the Soca Warriors, currently the team's all-time leading scorer with 70 goals in 115 caps (as of 9 February 2011), and is also the 7th highest international goalscorer according to the list of Top international association football goal scorers by country, behind Pelé, Ferenc Puskás and Ali Daei. He is also the all-time top CONCACAF goal scorer. He was instrumental in helping his country qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and played in all three of his country's World Cup group matches at Germany 2006. In Germany, he scored an offside goal. He was also named Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation Player of the Year in 2002. John is currently the second most capped Trinidad and Tobago international behind former teammate Angus Eve. He was the only player to score in 12 consecutive international matches, from 1998 to 1999.

Reception

In a 2014 review, Elena Opris wrote in Softpedia, ""The Good: LibreOffice's best features are applicable in all modules. Draw sports numerous options and configuration parameters for defining each part of the graphical plan as well as for the general elements in the interface (such as toolbars and keyboard shortcuts). The styles and formatting presets simplify the entire layout designing process. The document recovery feature usually comes to the rescue when experiencing system crashes."" Opris noted, ""The Bad: The program often takes a while to paste pictures as well as to load some features. It froze several times during our evaluation when inserting files with unsupported formats, which eventually led us to restarting Draw.""

Writing in December 2017 for It's FOSS, Ankush Das, said, ""LibreOffice Draw module is one of the best open source alternatives to Microsoft Visio. With the help of it, you can either choose to make a quick sketch of an idea or a complex professional floor plan for presentation. Flowcharts, organization charts, network diagrams, brochures, posters, and what not! All that without even requiring to spend a penny.""

PAT Research described Draw in a 2018 review, ""LibreOffice Draw is a powerful office and flowchart software that provides a clean interface and tools that enable users to unleash their creativity and enhance their productivity"".

GoFree wrote, ""it is simply amazing that a free vector graphics editor like this can deliver such professional results.""

"Upper Lusatian Heath and Pond Landscape

The Upper Lusatian Heath and Pond Landscape (also ... District or ... Lake District, ) is a natural region in Saxony. It runs from a line between Wittichenau and Kamenz for roughly 60 kilometres in an east-west direction as far as the River Neisse. Its width between the bordering natural regions of the Upper Lusatian Gefilde and Eastern Upper Lusatia to the south and the Muskau Heath and Upper Lusatian Mining Region to the north is between 15 and 20 kilometres.

The landscape is a transition zone between the hilly southern part of Upper Lusatia and Lower Lusatia. Its central part takes in the Upper Lusatian Heath and Pond Landscape Biosphere Reserve, whose core zone is a nature reserve.

The region is part of the Saalian glaciation meltwater valley or urstromtal. Valley sands close to the groundwater level at heights of between 130 and 150 metres alternate with stretches of valley bottom over 500 metres wide and only a few metres lower. Dry areas lie next to waterlogged or even boggy areas.

Almost 10% of the area is made up of 335 ponds, which makes the Upper Lusatian Heath and Lake District the largest economically utilized pond region in Europe.

Part of the original landscape was destroyed by the brown coal open-cast mine around the Boxberg Power Station, however the pits left behind have been flooded and now form a new part of the countryside.

The potential natural vegetation (pnV) is birch and oak-pine woods, with alder and ash woods in the water meadows.

"Marie C. Couvent Elementary School

Marie C. Couvent Elementary was a historic elementary school in New Orleans, Louisiana named for Marie Couvent, an African American former slave who married successful African American businessman Bernard Couvent and deeded property for a school for orphans in her community (Institute Catholique). The school was built in 1940 in Faubourg Marigny and originally named Marigny Elementary School. It was renamed for Marie Couvent and renamed again in 1997 to A. P. Tureaud Elementary School because the Couvents had slaves.

History
In 1989 Sun Ra performed in front of the school. In the 1990s a campaign was launched to rename city public schools that venerated slaveholders. Since Couvent and her husband owned slaves, and the school changed its name in 1997 to A. P. Tureaud Elementary School for A.P. Tureaud. Manumission may have been illegal during the era they lived so their options to free people may have been limited. The school closed in 2013.

"Scott Report

The Scott Report (the Report of the Inquiry into the Export of Defence Equipment and Dual-Use Goods to Iraq and Related Prosecutions) was a judicial inquiry commissioned in 1992 after reports of arms sales to Iraq in the 1980s by British companies surfaced. The report was conducted by Sir Richard Scott, then a Lord Justice of Appeal. It was published in 1996. Much of the report was secret.

Background
In the late 1980s, Matrix Churchill, a British (Coventry) aerospace quality machine tools manufacturer that had been bought by the Iraqi government, was exporting machines used in weapons manufacture to Iraq. According to the International Atomic Energy Authority, the products later found in Iraq were among the highest quality of their kind in the world. They were 'dual use' machines that could be used to manufacture weapons parts. Such exports are subject to government control, and Matrix Churchill had the appropriate government permissions, following a 1988 relaxation of export controls. Crucially, however, this relaxation had not been announced to Parliament – indeed, when asked in Parliament whether controls had been relaxed, the then-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry replied incorrectly that they had not.

Matrix Churchill was contacted by HM Customs and Excise, under suspicion of exporting arms components to Iraq without permission. It had this permission but this was denied by the government, in line with the most recently announced policy on the matter. Matrix Churchill's directors were therefore prosecuted in 1991 by Customs and Excise for breaching export controls.

The trial did not go well for the government – public interest immunity certificates obtained by the government to suppress some critical evidence (supposedly on grounds of national security) were quickly overturned by the trial judge, forcing the documents to be handed over to the defence. The trial eventually collapsed when former minister Alan Clark admitted he had been 'economical with the actualité in answer to parliamentary questions regarding what he knew about export licenses to Iraq.

Report
The Scott Report represents possibly the most exhaustive study produced to that date of the individual responsibility of ministers to Parliament. Scott comments on the difficulty of extracting from departments the required documents (some 130,000 of them in all) and notes how Customs and Excise could not find out what Ministry of Defence export policy was, and how intelligence reports were not passed on to those who needed to know. The Economist commented that ""Sir Richard exposed an excessively secretive government machine, riddled with incompetence, slippery with the truth and willing to mislead Parliament"". The report characterised the nature of the government as:

Scott identified three main areas of democratic concern. First, the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939 was emergency legislation passed at the outbreak of the Second World War. It allowed the government to issue regulations which were not subject to resolutions in Parliament, for the duration of the emergency, which would make it a criminal offence to export particular goods to particular countries. While the Act should have been lapsed in 1945, it remained in force, and had been modified in 1990 so as to become part of the Import and Export Control Act 1990.

The second area was the failure of ministerial accountability; the principle that ""for every action of a servant of the crown a minister is answerable to Parliament"".

The third area was that of public-interest immunity certificates, which had been issued during the Matrix Churchill trial. As a result of these certificates, innocent men were in danger of being sent to prison, because the government would not allow the defence counsel to see the documents that would exonerate their clients.  While some of these contained potentially sensitive intelligence material, many were simply internal communications: the certificates were intended to protect the ministers and civil servants who had written the communications, rather than the public interest. Scott states:

Publication 
The publication of the report was seen by many as the nadir of the 1990s Conservative governments of the UK. Prior to the report's publication, those ministers who were criticised were given the opportunity to comment and request revisions. The 1,806-page report was published, along with a press pack which included a few relatively positive extracts from the report presented as if representative of the entire report, at 3:30pm. Given a then largely pro-government press, this proved effective at stalling an extensive analysis in the media.

The report had to be debated in Parliament. Ministers criticised in the report were given advanced access to the report and briefed extensively on how to defend themselves against the report's criticisms. In contrast, according to senior Labour MP Robin Cook, the opposition were given just two hours to read the million-plus words, during which scrutiny they were supervised and prevented from making copies of the report. Finally, the Prime Minister, John Major, stated that a vote against the Government would be in effect a vote of no confidence, ensuring that Conservative MPs would not vote against, while a vote for was a vote exonerating the Government of any wrongdoing. Robin Cook worked with a team of researchers to scrutinise the report, and delivered ""what was regarded as a bravura performance"". Nonetheless, the Government won the vote 320–319.

"Clackmannanshire and Dunblane (Scottish Parliament constituency)

Clackmannanshire and Dunblane is a constituency of the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood). It elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the plurality (first past the post) method of election. It is also one of nine constituencies in the Mid Scotland and Fife electoral region, which elects seven additional members, in addition to the nine constituency MSPs, to produce a form of proportional representation for the region as a whole. Created in 2011, the constituency covers much of the area previously in the abolished Ochil.

Electoral region 

The other eight constituencies of the Mid Scotland and Fife region are Cowdenbeath, Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy, Mid Fife and Glenrothes, North East Fife, Perthshire North, Perthshire South and Kinross-shire and Stirling.

The region covers all of the Clackmannanshire council area, all of the Fife council area, all of the Perth and Kinross council area and all of the Stirling council area.

Constituency boundaries and council areas 

The Ochil constituency was created at the same time as the Scottish Parliament, in 1999, with the name and boundaries of a pre-existing Westminster (House of Commons) constituency. In 2005, however, Scottish Westminster constituencies were mostly replaced with new constituencies. The Ochil Westminster constituency, was divided between the Ochil and South Perthshire Westminster constituency and the Stirling Westminster constituency.

The constituency covers all of the Clackmannanshire council area, while the rest of the Stirling council area is covered by the Stirling constituency.

From the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Ochil was largely replaced by an expanded constituency of Clackmannanshire and Dunblane.

The electoral wards used in the creation of Clackmannshire and Dunblane are:

"Nasr ibn Sayyar

Naṣr ibn Sayyār al-Lāythi al-Kināni (; 663–748) was an Arab general and the last Umayyad governor of Khurasan in 738–748. Nasr played a distinguished role in the wars against the Turgesh, although he failed to decisively confront the rebellion of al-Harith ibn Surayj in its early stages. Although respected as a soldier and a statesman, he owed his appointment as governor more to his obscure tribal background, which rendered him dependent on the Caliph. His tenure was nevertheless successful, as Nasr introduced long-overdue tax reforms that alleviated social tension and largely restored and stabilized Umayyad control in Transoxiana, which had been greatly reduced under the Turgesh onslaught. His last years were occupied by inter-tribal rivalries and uprisings, however, as the Caliphate itself descended into a period of civil war. In 746 Nasr was driven from his capital by Ibn Surayj and Juday al-Kirmani, but returned after the latter fell out among themselves, resulting in Ibn Surayj's death. Preoccupied with this conflict, Nasr was unable to stop the outbreak and spread of the Abbasid Revolution, whose leader, Abu Muslim, exploited the situation to his advantage. Evicted from his province in early 748, he fled to Persia pursued by the Abbasid forces, where he died on 9 December 748.

Early life and career 

Nasr was a military leader with long service and experience in Khurasan. As early as 705 he participated in a campaign along the upper Oxus River, led by Salih, the brother of Qutayba ibn Muslim, the general who had been tasked with subduing Transoxiana. For his service during this campaign, Nasr was awarded an entire village in this region. Despite the successes of Qutayba, much of Central Asia east of the Oxus remained outside effective Arab control; while garrisons had been established in places like Samarkand, Balkh, or Bukhara, the Caliphate largely relied on cliental relationships with the multitude of local rulers, who became tributary to the Umayyads. In addition, clashes with the Chinese-backed Türgesh, the ambiguous policy followed regarding conversion of the native population (mass conversions would lessen the taxable population and hence the amount of tribute received) and increasing inter-Arab tribal factionalism weakened Umayyad control over the region and necessitated increased military activity.

In 724, Nasr is recorded as heading a Mudari army sent against Balkh, where restive Yemenite troops refused to participate in the expedition against Ferghana that resulted in the disastrous ""Day of Thirst"". His troops, reinforced by men from the subject Hephthalite principality of Chaghaniyan, clashed with the Yemenis at Baruqan and prevailed over them. This led to resentment towards his person among the Yemenis, especially from those around Balkh; and during the governorship of the Yemeni Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri, along with other Mudari leaders, Nasr fell into disfavour and was mistreated.

Nasr was one of the few Muslim leaders to distinguish himself in the disastrous Battle of the Defile in July 731. In 734 he was appointed as governor of Balkh, after arresting the previous governor. There he faced the rebellion of the local Khurasani troops under al-Harith ibn Surayj, who called for reforms in taxation and the ending of discrimination towards the native converts (mawali). Ibn Surayj marched on Balkh and took the city with only 4,000 followers, even though Nasr commanded 10,000 men. It is unclear from the sources whether the town was seized from Nasr, or whether it was captured in his absence and then successfully held against him. In any case, Nasr and his army remained passive for the remainder of the revolt; they did not aid the provincial capital, Merv, when the rebels attacked it, and this stance encouraged several local tribes to join the uprising. Eventually however the rebels were defeated by Juday al-Kirmani, with Ibn Surayj fleeing across the Oxus to the Türgesh.

Appointment as governor of Khurasan 

In July 738, at the age of 74, Nasr was appointed as governor of Khurasan. Despite his age, he was widely respected both for his military record, his knowledge of the affairs of Khurasan and his abilities as a statesman. Julius Wellhausen wrote of him that ""His age did not affect the freshness of his mind, as is testified not only by his deeds, but also by the verses in which he gave expression to his feelings till the very end of his life"". However, in the climate of the times, his nomination owed more to his appropriate tribal affiliation than his personal qualities.

From the early days of the Muslim conquests, Arab armies were divided into regiments drawn from individual tribes or tribal confederations (butun or ʿashaʿir). Despite the fact that many of these groupings were recent creations, created for reasons of military efficiency rather than any common ancestry, they soon developed a strong and distinct identity. Eventually, and certainly by the beginning of the Umayyad period, this system progressed to the formation of ever-larger super-groupings, culminating in the two super-groups: the northern Arab Mudaris or Qaysis, and the southern Arabs or ""Yemenis"" (Yaman), dominated by the Azd and Rabi'ah tribes. By the 8th century, this division had become firmly established across the Caliphate and was a source of constant internal instability, as the two groups formed in essence two rival political parties, jockeying for power and separated by a fierce hatred for each other. During Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik's reign, the Umayyad government appointed Mudaris as governors in Khurasan, except for Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri's tenure in 735–738. Nasr's appointment came four months after Asad's death. In the interim, the sources report variously that the province was run either by the Syrian general Ja'far ibn Hanzala al-Bahrani or by Asad's lieutenant Juday al-Kirmani. At any rate, the sources agree that al-Kirmani stood at the time as the most prominent man in Khurasan and should have been the clear choice for governor. His Yemeni roots (he was the leader of the Azd in Khurasan), however, made him unpalatable to the Caliph.

Nasr on the other hand, in addition to his other qualities, was a Mudari and married to a Tamimi wife. He would therefore be acceptable to the numerous Mudari element of the Khurasani army, which outnumbered the Yemenis, but could also, as a local, help to reduce the Khurasani Arabs' discontent towards the Syria-centric Umayyad government. Nasr's own relatively obscure tribal background—from a non-noble family of the Layth tribe from Kinanah—also suited the Caliph's purposes, as it meant that he lacked any local power base of his own. Indeed, Nasr's rule throughout his tenure was not fully accepted by many Arab tribesmen: aside from the Yemenis, who favoured their ""own"" candidate al-Kirmani and resented the shift in power back towards the Mudaris, the Qays around Nishapur refused to support him, and even the Syrian contingent sided with his opponents. Nasr was hence mostly reliant on the support of his wife's powerful Tamim tribe living around Marv. As long as he was supported by a strong central government in Damascus, Nasr was able to keep his internal enemies in check, but in the troubles that followed Hisham's death in 743, that support vanished. In the event, Nasr would succeed in retaining his office for a decade, despite the turmoil that swept the Caliphate after 743. When Yazid III came to power in early 744, he initially ordered Nasr replaced. Nasr refused to accept this, and held on to the post, being eventually confirmed to it a few months later. After Marwan II's rise to power in December 744, he likewise affirmed Nasr's position.

Reforms and campaigns 
Nasr gave his province an unprecedented period of good government, stability and prosperity, so that, in the words of the 9th-century historian al-Mada'ini, ""Khurasan was built up as it had never been before"". His major achievements during his tenure were the reform of the tax system and the restoration of Umayyad control over Transoxiana.

The Khurasani tax system had been established at the time of the Muslim conquest and remained unchanged since. It relied on the collection of a fixed tribute by the local non-Muslim (mostly Zoroastrian) gentry, the dihqans, who often discriminated against the Muslim settlers and the native converts. This contributed to the latter's increasing resentment of Umayyad rule, and the demand for a tax reform had fuelled past revolts like that of Ibn Surayj. Consequently, Nasr streamlined the tax system in 739, implementing a blanket imposition (the kharaj) on all owners of agricultural land and forcing the non-Muslims to pay an additional poll tax (the jizyah). In this way, the chroniclers report, 30,000 Muslims were absolved of the jizyah, and 80,000 non-Muslims were forced to pay it instead. Attention was also paid to the accurate collection of the kharaj in accordance with treaties with the local rulers, as a result of which the tax burden was generally eased. This reform is traditionally held to have assisted in regaining the loyalty of the local populations and their princes, who returned quickly to the Arab fold. Other modern scholars however consider the effect of this belated reform on the prevailing anti-Umayyad climate as minimal. Upon his appointment, Nasr also moved the provincial capital back to Merv from Balkh, where Asad had established it. Additionally, for the first time in the province's history he appointed sub-governors. They were drawn from among his allies and supporters in order to reward them and to improve his own control of the province.

Taking advantage of the disintegration of the Türgesh khaganate after the murder of the khagan Suluk, Nasr moved aggressively across the Oxus. His first campaign, immediately after his appointment, was in the area of Chaghaniyan; his second campaign, in 740, recovered much territory in Sogdia, including Samarkand, with little apparent resistance. Aiming to recover all the lands previously conquered under Qutayba ibn Muslim and to curtail the activities of the renegade Ibn Surayj, who was based there, Nasr then launched an expedition targeting al-Shash (Tashkent). The principality of Usrushana submitted peacefully, but when the Muslim army reached the Jaxartes, it was confronted by a 15,000-strong force from Shash along with Ibn Surayj's men and some Türgesh; according to Arab tradition, the latter were led by Suluk's murderer and successor, Kursul. According to the Arab sources, Nasr was able to drive off the Türgesh and scored a victory against one of their detachments, killing its chief. He apparently failed to subdue al-Shash, for he was forced to content himself with an agreement with the ruler of Shash, whereby Ibn Surayj was evicted to Farab, where the latter was left unmolested to continue his opposition to the Umayyads. Nasr also launched two expeditions against Ferghana, which plundered and ravaged the countryside and took many captives. It seems, however, that the Muslim reconquest at this time did not extend much further than Samarkand, with occasional tribute being possibly levied from the remoter principalities. 
 
Outwardly at least, by 743 the Umayyad position in Khurasan appeared stronger than ever. The reality beneath the splendid façade however was different. Tension and mutual mistrust existed between the Khurasani Arab levies (muqatila) and the 20,000 Syrian troops introduced into the province as a security measure after the disastrous Battle of the Defile in 731, while tribal antagonisms continued to create trouble: apart from continued Yemeni resentment at Nasr, there was strong dislike of the Umayyads' Syrian regime, fanned by their unjust tax policies. Although Nasr tried to remedy the situation, it was too late.

In addition, Khurasan was a major center of early Shiism, and specifically of the Kaysanite sect of the Hashimiyya, which had gained wide acceptance in the province, especially among the mawali. In 742–743, Nasr confronted and defeated a revolt led by Yahya, son of Zayd ibn Ali and the leader of the Hashimiyya in Khurasan. Yahya was captured and executed, and the resulting vacuum in Hashimi leadership opened the path for the Khurasani branch of the movement to come under the control of the Abbasid family. It is however, a testament to the ""respect and even affection"" (Gibb) with which Nasr was regarded by the native population in Transoxiana, that in contrast to Khurasan no native city there welcomed the Hashimi missionaries, and that they remained loyal to him even during the later Abbasid Revolution.

Civil wars and the Abbasid Revolution 

In 743, after the death of Caliph Hisham, his successor Walid II reconfirmed Nasr in his post, but the influential governor of Iraq, Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, an opponent of Nasr, tried to lure him away from his province by calling him to Iraq. Nasr delayed his departure, stalling for time, and was saved by the murder of Walid in April 744. Walid's successor, Yazid III, moved to install a regime dominated by the Yemeni Kalb tribe. Nasr's position was severely undermined, and the Yemeni faction now hoped to see their leader Juday al-Kirmani appointed governor in his stead. Indeed, Yazid appointed his favourite, the Kalbi Mansur ibn Jumhur, as governor of Iraq, and he in turn nominated his own brother as Nasr's replacement. Nasr refused to accept this, and was again fortunate in his persistence, for Mansur fell out of favour and was dismissed after only two months. Agitation among the Yemeni faction persisted, amidst rumours that Nasr had intercepted letters appointing al-Kirmani as governor, and a dispute on the payment of stipends to the muqatila. Nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al-Kirmani from his leadership of the Azd, as well as by trying to win over Azd and Rabi'ah leaders. This led to a general uprising by the Azd and Rabi'ah under al-Kirmani. It is indicative of the lingering inter-tribal antagonism of the late Umayyad world that the rebellion was launched in the name of revenge for the Muhallabids, an Azd family that had been purged after rebelling in 720—an act which had since become a symbol of Yemeni resentment of the Umayyads and their northern Arab-dominated regime.

On 13 July 744, Nasr captured and imprisoned al-Kirmani. After barely a month, the latter escaped, and his rebellion was joined not only by Azd soldiers, but also by many of the Arab settlers around Marv. A tentative truce was initially agreed upon, during which fruitless negotiations were conducted, but after Yazid reconfirmed Nasr in his post, al-Kirmani and the Yemenis—in reality, al-Kirmani's followers included other tribes as well, including most of the Syrians and even some Mudaris, but they were collectively called Yamaniyya in the sources—resumed their revolt. Nasr in turn tried to strengthen his own position by enlisting the services of al-Harith ibn Surayj, al-Kirmani's one-time adversary, who enjoyed considerable support among some Arab tribes and especially his fellow Tamimis. When Ibn Surayj arrived at Merv in July 745 he was enthusiastically received by the town's inhabitants. Scorning Nasr's proposals for cooperation, Ibn Surayj soon withdrew to the countryside and rose in rebellion as well. Ibn Surayj was also able to exploit the unpopularity of Marwan II among the Mudaris and Nasr's followers, even though Nasr recognized him as the legitimate Caliph in exchange for his own confirmation to his post. Exploiting this resentment, Ibn Surayj soon gathered around him an army of over 3,000 men.

In March 746 Ibn Surayj's army attacked Marv, but was repulsed with many casualties, and he then made common cause with al-Kirmani—of whose activities between his escape in 744 and this point nothing is known. With Marwan II still trying to consolidate his own position in Syria and Mesopotamia, Nasr was bereft of any hopes of reinforcement, and the allied armies of Ibn Surayj and al-Kirmani drove him out of Merv towards the end of 746. Nasr retreated to Nishapur, but within days al-Kirmani and Ibn Surayj fell out among themselves and clashed, resulting in the death of Ibn Surayj. Al-Kirmani then destroyed the Tamimi quarters in the city, a shocking act, as dwellings were traditionally considered exempt from warfare in Arab culture. As a result, the Mudari tribes, hitherto reserved towards Nasr, now came over to him. Backed by them, especially the Qays settled around Nishapur, Nasr now resolved to take back the capital. During summer 747, Nasr's and al-Kirmani's armies confronted each other before the walls of Marv, occupying two fortified camps and skirmishing with each other for several months. The fighting stopped only when news came of the start of the Hashimi uprising under Abu Muslim.

Negotiations commenced, but were almost broken off when a member of Nasr's entourage, an embittered son of Ibn Surayj, attacked and killed al-Kirmani. Calmer heads prevailed for the moment, the two sides were able to tentatively settle their differences, and Nasr re-occupied his seat in Marv. Tensions however remained and Abu Muslim soon managed to persuade al-Kirmani's son and successor Ali that Nasr had been involved in his father's murder. As a result, both Ali al-Kirmani and Nasr separately appealed  for aid against each other to Abu Muslim, who now held the balance of power. The latter eventually chose to support al-Kirmani. On 14 February 748, the Hashimi army occupied Marv, and Nasr again had to flee the city. Pursued by the Hashimi forces under Qahtaba ibn Shabib al-Ta'i, Nasr was forced to abandon Nishapur too after his son Tamim was defeated at Tus, and retreat to the region of Qumis, on the western borderlands of Khurasan. At this point, the long-awaited reinforcements from the Caliph arrived, but their general and Nasr failed to coordinate their movements, and Qahtaba was able to defeat the Caliph's army at Rayy and kill its commander. Nasr was now forced to abandon Qumis and flee towards Hamadan. On the way, in the town of Sawa, he fell ill and died on 9 December, at the age of 85.

His grandson, Rafi ibn al-Layth, led a large-scale rebellion against the misgovernment of the Abbasid governor Ali ibn Isa ibn Mahan in 807–810, which spread across Khurasan and Transoxiana.

Interstate 265 (I-265) is a  Interstate Highway encircling the Louisville, Kentucky, metropolitan area, which includes Southern Indiana. In Kentucky, it travels through Jefferson County, from I-65 in the southern part of Louisville, meeting I-65 again in Indiana, where the road continues west to I-64, where it ends.

The entire Kentucky stretch of the road is co-signed with Kentucky Route 841 (KY 841). An additional  stretch of freeway between US 31W/US 60/KY 1934 and I-65 in the south part of Louisville is solely designated as KY 841. The highway is named the Gene Snyder Freeway (originally named the Jefferson Freeway), after the former congressman, and usually called ""the Snyder"" by locals. It is considered part of Louisville's beltline.

Indiana

Interstate 265 (I-265) in the U.S. state of Indiana presently runs  from I-64 at the western edge of New Albany to the Lewis and Clark Bridge near Utica. Beginning at its western terminus, the freeway is concurrent with Indiana State Road 62 until Exit 10.

Kentucky
Interstate 265 (I-265) in the U.S. state of Kentucky presently runs  from the Lewis and Clark Bridge in northern Louisville to an interchange with I-65 in southern Louisville. The entire freeway is concurrent with Kentucky Route 841.

The Gene Snyder Freeway in which KY 841 and I-265 overlap for  between I-65 and the Indiana state line has seen an increase in serious accidents. The primary factors stem from its low-level grass median which offers little to no protection for crossover incidents. Driver inattention and increased traffic and congestion has led to a decline in the overall level-of-service. In 2006, cable barriers were installed in the median for  between I-71 and I-64, with further installation possible in the near future. Part of the road is currently signed in kilometers, which is unusual in the United States.

Kentucky Route 841

Kentucky Route 841 (KY 841) is a  state highway in the suburbs of Louisville. The route is a partial beltway, encircling Louisville on its southern and eastern sides. Compass direction changes to the north and south of exit 23, Taylorsville Road interchange. The western terminus of the route is at U.S. Route 31W (US 31W) and US 60 in the southwest Louisville community of Valley Station, where KY 841 continues to the west as KY 1934 while the northern terminus is at the Lewis and Clark Bridge and to the north of the East End Tunnel. The section between its terminus at KY 1934 and I-65 is solely designated as KY 841.

History

Originally signed just as KY 841, the Jefferson Freeway was constructed originally with two sections, one between KY 155 (Taylorsville Road) and US 60 (Shelbyville Road) and a second section between KY 1447 (Westport Road) and US 42 in the 1960s as short connectors to the eastern suburban expansion as well as a new Ford plant. I-264 by 1970 was woefully congested and was in dire need of reconstruction and other improvements, therefore I-265 was proposed as an outer beltway to provide pass-through motorists relief from the congestion of I-264. Construction started in the early 1980s and was finished later that decade and signed in 1987.

The road is signed as I-265 and KY 841 from the I-65 interchange to the Indiana state line. From I-65 west to US 31W (although it is up to Interstate Highway standards), is signed solely as KY 841 due to American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials numbering rules. KY 841 is signed throughout the entire designation of I-265. The exit numbering for the entire beltway starts at the western terminus of KY 841.

Indiana State Road 265

The segment of the highway between I-65 and SR 60 at Exit 10 in Indiana was formerly known as Indiana State Road 265. It was changed in June 2019 to an Interstate under approval by AASHTO.

Studies have also been conducted for the reconfiguration of the I-265 and I-64 interchange. It is currently an underpowered cloverleaf with no collector–distributor lanes, a relic of the original Jefferson Freeway.

In late 2005, members of the Louisville Metro Council proposed a committee to begin planning a western bridge to link the southwestern end of the highway in Kentucky to Indiana. However the proposal of the western bridge was not put into action yet.

On December 18, 2016, State Road 265 was extended east of State Road 62, which crosses the Ohio River connecting with KY 841, which was extended north of U.S. 42 in Kentucky as part of the Ohio River Bridges Project, creating a bypass around the eastern side of the city of Louisville.

On June 4, 2019, the two disjointed sections of I-265 were finally connected under AASHTO approval, with the Indiana State Road 265 designation decommissioned and replaced by I-265. However, the signage has not yet been replaced to reflect the AASHTO approval. The Kentucky Route 841 designation mostly concurrent with I-265 in Kentucky has remained.

Lewis and Clark Bridge

In various discussions for over 30 years, the Lewis and Clark Bridge (previously referred to as the East End Bridge) is part of a new  highway that connects State Road 265 in Indiana to KY 841 in Kentucky. The completion of the bridge connected the two disjointed highways to form a three-quarter beltway around the Louisville, Kentucky, metro area. The bridge was opened to traffic on December 18, 2016. There are currently no plans to construct a bridge on the west end of I-265.

"Salisbury (1818 ship)

Salisbury was launched c.1814 in the  almost certainly under another name and was possibly a prize. She was possibly captured by the British or sold to British owners in 1815. She made one voyage seal hunting in 1820 and transported settlers to South Africa in 1821. She was lost in 1827.

Origins and career
Salisbury origins and career are difficult to untangle because there were at various times several vessels by that name, all ranging between 117 and 125 tons burthen, and having similar trades. In 1821 Lloyd's Register (LR) carried two vessels named Salisbury, and the Register of Shipping carried four. It appears that LR missed one vessel completely and may have conflated two different vessels.

Salisbury first appeared in LR in 1815 with S. Creedy, master, London owners, and trade London–Sierra Leone. Her origins were given as a foreign prize. She first appeared in the Register of Shipping (RS) with J. Creedy, master, Craig, owner, and trade London–Africa. Her origins were given as Portugal, built in 1812.<ref name=RS1816>[https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015024214267?urlappend=%3Bseq=650 '""RS (1816), Seq.№1119.]</ref> However, in 1818 RS had two listings for Salisbury while LR had one that seemingly combined the two listings in RS.

Seal hunting voyage (1820–1821): On 8 September 1820 Messrs Cannan, Smith and Millars appointed Captain Thomas Hodges, late master of , to command of Salisbury to engage in seal hunting. He sailed from England on 15 September, bound for the South Shetland Islands. He arrived at New South Shetland in January 1821 and left on 16 February. Salisbury called at Buenos Aires and arrived in the Downs on 13 May and in the Thames by 22 May. She returned with 9000, or 9,821, or 8,926 seal skins.

FateSalisbury, of Liverpool, was lost off Cape Mount, Africa, on 1 June 1827. Her crew survived. Lloyd's List gave the name of her master as Bryan.

"Panamanian Chess Championship

The Panamanian Chess Championship is the individual national chess championship of Panama. The first edition was played in 1945 and won by Rubén Darío Cabrera.  It was originally a biennial event, and from 1945 to 1961 six championships were played, and from 1962 to 1971 eight championships.  From 1972 to 1976, it was held annually, but the tournament of 1977 never finished because the beginning of a long schism in Panamanian chess. From 1978 to 1988, it was again held annually.

In 1982 and 1989, and from 1991 to 2004, two organizations held separate events, resulting in two champions, but in 1990 there was a single competition, and therefore one champion.  In 2004 both federations made peace, and since 2005 then there has only been one championship each year.  At the end of the 1970s, the first women's chess championship was started, and it became an annual event in 2002. Panama is the only country in the world where a father and daughter have been champions in the same year twice: 2004 and 2008. To show the rise of new isthmian chess, Panama took 2008 the Centroamerican Championship by the hand of Jorge Baúles, first IM of Panama. In the youth categories, the signal (abs) show a champion in one big tournament with various categories at same time.

In 2010 there was no play because of official budget trouble with ""Pandeportes"", the government sports entity (which had three chiefs in only eleven months), and the tournament was played in the firsts months of 2011. In the final round of the 2014 tournament, two players were tied in all playoffs and were proclaimed champions. One is a foreigner, but changed his country flag as Panamanian in ratings.fide.com in March 2015, and is the fourth to win the title.  Usually the Panamanian common considered overseas with over five years of residence, as one of their own.

"SA Promo

SA Promo is a magazine published monthly in the United Kingdom since 2006. It is printed in A5-size format and is targeted at the community of approximately 1,500, 000 expatriate South Africans living in the United Kingdom.

History
SA Promo was founded in November 2006 by J. C. Muller and Justin Lester, who saw an opportunity after South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth post-apartheid. This allowed South Africans to apply for a working holiday visa to live and work in the United Kingdom for a period of two years. The United Kingdom saw an influx from South Africa, many of whom have subsequently settled in the country. On the 27 November 2008 the UK working holiday visa was replaced by a Point Based Visa System. The South African government does not have a reciprocal agreement with the British government and therefore no longer qualify for this category of visa. 

In 2014 the SA Promo changed focus to cater for all South Africans and not just South Africans abroad.

Circulation & Distribution

Internationally
With South Africans relocating all over the world the demand for media aimed at South Africans abroad has increased. SA Promo magazine is now available as an online magazine accessible from anywhere in the world.

Online

"Soviet prisoners of war in Finland

Soviet prisoners of war in Finland during World War II were captured in two Soviet-Finnish conflicts of that period: the Winter War and the Continuation War. The Finns took about 5,700 POWs during the Winter War, and due to the short length of the war they survived relatively well. However, during the Continuation War the Finns took 64,000 POWs, of whom almost 30 percent died.

Winter War

The number of Soviet prisoners of war during the Winter War (1939–1940) was 5,700, of whom 135 died. Most of them were captured in Finnish pockets (motti) north of Lake Ladoga. The war lasted only 105 days and most of the deceased POWs were either seriously wounded or sick. Some of the POWs, at least 152 men, enlisted in the so-called Russian Liberation Army in Finland. They were not allowed to take part in combat. After the war, some members of the Liberation Army managed to escape to a third country.

Continuation War
The number of Soviet prisoners of war during the Continuation War (1941–1944) was about 64,000. Most of them were captured in 1941 (56,000 persons). The first Soviet POWs were taken in June 1941 and were transferred to reserve prisons in Karvia, Köyliö, Huittinen and Pelso (a village in modern-day municipality of Vaala). Soon Finnish administration realized that the number of POWs was much greater than initially estimated, and established 32 new prison camps in 1941–1944. However, all of them were not used at the same time as POWs were used as a labour force in different projects around the country.

The Finns did not pay much attention to the living conditions of the Soviet POWs at the beginning of the war, as the war was expected to be of short duration. The quantity and quality of camp personnel was very low, as the more qualified men were at the front. It was not until the middle of 1942 that the quantity and quality of camp personnel was improved. There was a shortage of labour in Finland and authorities assigned POWs to forest and agricultural work, as well as the construction of fortification lines. Some Soviet officers cooperated with the Finnish authorities and were released from prison by the end of the war.

Finnic prisoners who were captured on the fronts or transferred by Germany  were separated from other Soviet POWs. At the end of 1942 volunteers could join the Finnish battalion Heimopataljoona 3, which consisted of Baltic Finns such as Karelians, Ingrian Finns, Votes and Veps.

Prisoner exchange with Germany 
About 2,600–2,800 Soviet prisoners of war were handed over to the Germans in exchange for roughly 2,200 Finnic prisoners of war held by the Germans. In November 2003, the Simon Wiesenthal Center submitted an official request to Finnish President Tarja Halonen for a full-scale investigation by the Finnish authorities of the prisoner exchange. In the subsequent study by Professor Heikki Ylikangas it turned out that about 2,000 of the exchanged prisoners joined the Russian Liberation Army. The rest, mostly army and political officers, (among them a name-based estimate of 74 Jews), most likely perished in Nazi concentration camps.

Deaths 
Most of the  deaths among Soviet POWs, 16,136, occurred in the ten-month period from December 1941 to September 1942. Prisoners died due to bad camp conditions and the poor supply of food, shelter, clothing, and health care. About a thousand POWs, 5 percent of total fatalities, were shot, primarily in escape attempts. Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest. Punishment for escape attempts or serious violations of camp rules included solitary confinement and execution. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, from 18,318 to 19,085 died  in Finnish prisoner of war camps.

In 1942 the number of prisoner deaths had a negative effect on Finland's international reputation. The Finnish administration decided to improve living conditions and allowed prisoners to work outside their camps.

Hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union ceased in September 1944, and the first Soviet POWs were handed over to the Soviet Union on 15 October 1944. The transfer was complete by the next month. Some of the POWs escaped during the transportation, and some of them were unwilling to return to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Finland handed over 2,546 German POWs from the Lapland War to the Soviet Union.

Trials in Finland 
According to the Moscow Armistice, signed by Finland and the victorious Allies, mainly the Soviet Union, the Finns were to try those who were responsible for the war and those who had committed war crimes. The Soviet Union allowed Finland to try its own war criminals, unlike other losing countries of the Second World War. The Finnish parliament had to create ex post facto laws for the trials, though in the case of war crimes the country had already signed the Hague IV Convention. In victorious Allied countries war-crime trials were exceptional, but Finland had to arrange full-scale investigations and trials, and report them for the Soviet Union.

Criminal charges were filed against 1,381 Finnish POW camp staff members, resulting in 723 convictions and 658 acquittals. They were accused of 42 murders and 342 other homicides. Nine persons were sentenced to life sentences, 17 to imprisonment for 10–15 years, 57 to imprisonment for five to ten years, and 447 to imprisonment varying from one month to five years. Fines or disciplinary corrections were levied out in 124 cases. Although the criminal charges were highly politicized, some war crime charges were filed already during the Continuation War. However, most of them were not processed during wartime.

Aftermath

Winter War POWs Returned to the Soviet Union 
After the Winter War, the Soviet POWs were returned to the USSR in accordance with the Moscow Peace Treaty. They were transported under heavy guard by the NKVD to special camps as suspected traitors. Prisoners were interrogated by 50 person research teams. After lengthy investigations about 500 of the prisoners were found guilty of high treason and sentenced to death. Some prisoners were released, but most of them, 4,354 men, were sentenced to five to eight years in labour camps (gulag). This would lead to the later death of some of the prisoners due to harsh camp conditions.

Continuation War POWs Returned to the Soviet Union 
After the Continuation War, Finland handed over all Soviet and German prisoners of war in accordance with the 10th article of the Moscow Armistice. Furthermore, the article also stipulated the return of all Soviet nationals who were deported to Finland during the Continuation War. This meant that Finland also had to hand over all those who moved to Finland voluntarily, as well as those who fought in the ranks of the Finnish army against the Soviet union, though some had Finnish citizenship. The return to the Soviet Union was in many cases fatal for these people, as some of them were executed as traitors at the Soviet train station at Vyborg and some died in harsh camp conditions in Siberia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union the survivors were allowed to return to Finland.

Some of the Soviet prisoners of war co-operated with the Finns during the war. Before the end of the war all related Finnish archives, including interrogation documents relating to co-operating prisoners, were destroyed; and these POWs' destinations after the war are uncertain. Some of them were secretly transported by Finnish army personnel to Sweden and some continued on as far as the United States. The highest ranking Soviet prisoner of war was Major General Vladimir Kirpichnikov, who returned to the Soviet Union. He was tried, convicted of high treason, and executed in 1950.

Legal position of Soviet POWs 
Finland had signed the 1907 Hague IV Convention in 1922 that covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. However, Finland announced that it could not completely obey the convention as the Soviet Union had not signed the same convention. The convention required ratification by both parties to the hostilities before going into effect. Finland did not sign the updated 1929 Third Geneva Convention, because it conflicted with some clauses of Finnish criminal law. Although the Soviet Union had not signed the Hague IV Convention, the reality was unclear and ambiguous. Soviet law specified that a Soviet soldier's surrender constituted treason which was punishable by death or imprisonment and seizure of the soldier's property.

"The Necessary Beggar

The Necessary Beggar is an adult science fiction novel written by Susan Palwick. Published on October 1, 2005 by Tor Books, it is the author's second novel. The book received the Alex Award in 2006 and was nominated for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award in 2007.

Plot 
The Necessary Beggar tells the story of alleged murderer Darroti and his family after he is exiled from the city of Lémabantunk in Gandiffri, a  paradisaical land built on the central idea of community. Murder is the sole unforgivable crime in this world, and as Darroti is accused of murdering a mendicant (a holy beggar), his crimes are considered particularly egregious. Darroti's family follows him through the glowing doorway that leads to the randomly selected realm of his exile. They emerge at the entrance of an American refugee camp. Unable to speak the language or explain their origins, the family is prohibited from being officially admitted into the country but impossible to deport. The situation is made worse by the heightened xenophobia present in this year 2022 version of America.

Faced with the guilt of his family’s exile, Darroti commits suicide to relieve his loved ones of his burden. Rather than be reincarnated in a new form as he would have been in his homeland, he becomes a ghost. To his dismay, his death throws his father into depression and embitters his other family members. He attempts to provide explanation by entering his father’s dreams, but his communications are interpreted as nightmares.

Lisa and Stan, camp volunteers and evangelists, help the family adapt to the new culture. Zamatryna, one of Darroti’s nieces, is the quickest to adapt thanks to her high intelligence. When a bomb planted by an anti-immigration group explodes in the camp, Lisa helps the family escape under the guise of death. She allows them to live in the home inherited from her mother with the loose promise of payback at a later date.

Zamatryna continues to flourish in school, convinced that education is the only way to make her family’s life easier, while the adults acquire work. She meets a boy named Jerry who slowly convinces her to consider her own desires and open up to those who wish to know her. The final push is made by Darroti when he manipulates the dreams of the more susceptible Jerry. Through Jerry, the family discovers that Darroti didn't murder the mendicant; she was in fact his lover, and under the impression that Darroti had been unfaithful, killed herself. With the truth now known, Darroti’s spirit is returned to Lémabantunk. Zama and Jerry marry so that she may gain citizenship and sponsor her family.

Characters 
 Darroti - Timbor's youngest child. Restless and impulsive, he was never quite as comfortable with life in Lémabantunk as the other members of the family. His displeasure with his place in life was expressed by excessive spending and alcoholism. It is when he locks himself in a friend's apartment to detox for his lover that she misinterprets his act of love as infidelity. 
 Zamatryna - Eroloit and Harani's daughter. She arrives in the United States as a child and is unable to recall much of Lémabantunk. In addition to being highly intelligent, she assimilates to the new culture with the most ease. This results in the burden of the family's future being placed on her shoulders. Zama also carries a beetle into the U.S. which continually traces an X, the symbol of silence in Lémabantunk, which causes her to hide its existence. This beetle is the ""murdered"" mendicant in her reincarnated form.
 Timbor - the family's patriarch and the father of Eroloit, Darroti, and Macsofo. Their mother, Frella, died before the events of the story took place. In his move from Lémabantunk to America, TImbor transitions from carpet merchant to taxi driver. He is the only character to form a bond with Stan. 
 Macsofo - the family member who harbors the most resentment towards Darroti and the situation that his alleged crime has put them in. He becomes short-tempered and verbally abusive to the point that his wife leaves the family home and takes the children with her.
 Gallicina - the mendicant Darroti is accused of murdering. It is unusual that she decides to become a mendicant, because it's normally a rite of passage reserved for men. In addition to being part of a protected class as a mendicant, she comes from a prestigious family which makes for a large class discrepancy between her and Darroti.
 Lisa's - Stan's wife. Her main occupation is helping Stan to grow the congregation of the small church that he operates from home. She is respectful of the family's culture and makes no overt attempts at converting them to Christianity. She served time in prison long ago.
 Stan - the pastor of a small, struggling church. He makes a concentrated effort to convert the family and considers the expression of their religion to be blasphemous. His portrayal of Christianity frightens the family making his efforts unsuccessful.

Reception 
Publishers Weekly called the novel ""a sharp meditation on refugees and displaced persons and a tragicomedy of cultural differences.""

"Olev Vinn

Olev Vinn  (January 26, 1971) is Estonian paleobiologist and paleontologist.

Vinn graduated from the biology class of Tallinn 3. Secondary School in 1989. He studied geology at the University of Tartu from 1989 to 1993. Vinn holds an M.Sc. 
degree in paleontology and stratigraphy from the University of Tartu in 1995 and a Ph.D. degree in geology from the same university in 2001. He is senior research fellow 
in paleontology at the University of Tartu since 2007. He has published more than 100 peer reviewed papers in international scientific journals.

Taxonomic studies
Vinn has described new genera and species of brachiopods, cornulitids, microconchids, serpulid polychaetes and trace fossils. He is a specialist of extinct tubicolous fossils. A microconchid species Microconchus vinni is named in honour of his taxonomic studies of tentaculitoid tubeworms.

Biomineralization studies
Vinn has described majority of annelid skeletal ultrastructures.
Oriented tube structures are present in many serpulid species and cannot
be explained by the standard carbonate slurry model. Vinn
and his co-authors have hypothesized that oriented structures in serpulid tubes have been
secreted in the same way as in mollusc shells, based on their ultrastructural similarity.
Vinn and his co-authors proposed alternative ways to explain the calcified secretory
granules described by Neff  in the lumen of the calcium-secreting glands in
serpulids. They proposed that worm actually produces calcium-saturated mucus in the glands. The mucus
is then deposited on the tube aperture, where crystallization of the structure is
controlled by an organic matrix, as in molluscs.The calcified granules in the glands may only
be an artifact of fixation and formed after the death of the worm.

Paleoecology studies
Vinn has studied evolution of symbiosis in several groups of early invertebrates such as cornulitids, microconchids, bryozoans, brachiopods, crinoids, stromatoporoids, tabulates and rugosans. He has described serpulid faunas of Mesozoic to Recent hydrocarbon seeps. A Late Devonian coral species ?Michelinia vinni is named in honour of his contribution to knowledge of ecology of Palaeozoic bioconstructing organisms. A crinoid species name Hiiumaacrinus vinni recognizes his
significant contributions to the Silurian paleontology of Estonia.

Publications
Some of Vinn's more important publications include:

"9th Intelligence Squadron

The United States Air Force's 9th Intelligence Squadron is an intelligence unit located at Beale Air Force Base, California. The 9th is associated with Lockheed U-2 and Distributed Common Ground System operations.  The squadron was first active during World War II as the 9th Photographic Technical Unit, serving in the European Theater of Operations.

The 9th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron was active from 1948 through 1950 and again from 1966 through 1991, primarily as the photographic interpretation unit of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing.  It was consolidated with the 9th Photographic Technical Unit in 1985 and the 9th Intelligence Squadron in 2009.

Mission
The 9th operates and maintains the $15M Deployable Shelterized System-Film, the Department of Defense's only mobile film processing capability, as part of the Air Force Distributed Common Ground System architecture.  The unit also processes, exploits, and disseminates broad area, high-resolution imagery collected by the Lockheed U-2 to meet combatant commander requirements.

History

World War II
The squadron was first organized in France during the fall of 1944 as the 9th Photographic Laboratory Section.  The section would provide processing of reconnaissance photography for XXIX Tactical Air Command (Provisional).  It continued this mission through V-E Day.  It briefly acted as part of the army of occupation, returning to the United States in November 1945, where it was inactivated at the Port of Embarkation.

Strategic reconnaissance support
The second predecessor of the squadron was activated  in July 1948 as the 12th Photographic Technical Squadron at Topeka Air Force Base, Kansas, where it was assigned to the 311th Air Division, which was the primary reconnaissance headquarters for Strategic Air Command (SAC).  In 1949, SAC reorganized its reconnaissance assets, assigning the squadron to the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and moving it to Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base, California as the 9th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron.

On 1 April 1950, however, the 9th Wing mission changed from long-range reconnaissance to strategic bombardment.  Ten days later, the 9th Squadron moved to Rapid City Air Force Base, South Dakota, where it was assigned to the 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing.  It was inactivated at the end of the month, with its assets forming the cadre for the 28th Reconnaissance Technical Squadron.

The squadron was again organized in late June 1966, at Beale Air Force Base, California, where it absorbed the mission, personnel and equipment of the 4203d Reconnaissance Technical Squadron, which was discontinued the same day.  The squadron processed reconnaissance products produced by the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing's Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird and, later, Lockheed U-2 Dragon Ladys until inactivating in July 1991.

Intelligence
The 9th Intelligence Support Squadron was activated at Beale in September 1991, the same day its predecessor was inactivated, assuming much of its mission, equipment and personnel.  The squadron dropped ""support"" from its name in 2003, and in July 2009, the two squadrons were consolidated.

"News broadcasting

News broadcasting is the medium of broadcasting of various news events and other information via television, radio, or internet in the field of broadcast journalism. The content is usually either produced locally in a radio studio or television studio newsroom, or by a broadcast network. It may also include additional material such as sports coverage weather forecasts, traffic reports, commentary, and other material that the broadcaster feels is relevant to their audience.

Television news
Television news refers to disseminating current events via the medium of television. A ""news bulletin"" or a ""newscast"" are television programs lasting from seconds to hours that provide updates on international, national, regional, and/or local news events.

There are numerous providers of broadcast news content such as BBC News, NBC News, CNN, Fox News Channel, and Al Jazeera, as well as numerous programs that regularly provide this content such as NBC Nightly News. In addition to general news outlets, there are specialized news outlets, for example about sports ESPNews, Fox Sports News, and Eurosport News, as well as finances, including CNBC, Bloomberg Television, and Fox Business Network.

Television news is very visually-based, showing video footage of many of the events that are reported; still photography is also used in reporting news stories, although not as much in recent years as in the early days of broadcast television. Television channels may provide news bulletins as part of a regularly scheduled news program. Less often, television shows may be interrupted or replaced by breaking news reports (""news flashes"") to provide news updates on events of great importance.

Radio news
Radio news is similar to television news, but is transmitted through the medium of the radio instead. It is based on the audio aspect rather than the visual aspect. Sound bites are captured through various reporters (generally through audio capture devices such as tape recorders) and played back through the radio. News updates occur more often on radio than on television – usually about once or twice an hour.

Structure, content, and style

Television
Newscasts, also known as bulletins or news program(me)s, differ in content, tone, and presentation style depending on the format of the channel/station on which they appear, and their timeslot. In most parts of the world, national television networks will have bulletins featuring national and international news. The top-rated shows will often air in the evening during ""prime time"", but there are also  morning newscasts of two to three hours in length. Rolling news channels broadcast news content 24 hours a day. The advent of the internet has allowed the regular 24-hour-a-day presentation of many video and audio news reports, which are updated when additional information becomes available; many television broadcasters provide content originally provided on-air as well as exclusive or supplementary news content on their websites. Local news may be presented by standalone local television stations, stations affiliated with national networks or by local studios which ""opt-out"" of national network programming at specified points. Different news programming may be aimed at different audiences, depending on age, socio-economic group, or those from particular sections of society. ""Magazine-style"" television shows (or newsmagazines) may mix news coverage with topical lifestyle issues, debates, or entertainment content. Public affairs programs provide analysis of and interviews about political, social, and economic issues.

News programs feature one or two (sometimes, three) anchors (or presenters, the terminology varies depending on the world) segueing into news stories filed by a reporter (or correspondent) by describing the story to be shown; however, some stories within the broadcast are read by the presenter themselves; in the former case, the anchor ""tosses"" to the reporter to introduce the featured story; likewise, the reporter ""tosses"" back to the anchor once the taped report has concluded and the reporter provides additional information. Often in situations necessitating long-form reporting on a story (usually during breaking news situations), the reporter is interviewed by the anchor, known as a 'two-way', or a guest involved in or offering analysis on the story is interviewed by a reporter or anchor. There may also be breaking news stories which will present live rolling coverage.

Television news organizations employ several anchors and reporters to provide reports (as many as ten anchors, and up to 20 reporters for local news operations or up to 30 for national news organizations). They may also employ specialty reporters that focus on reporting certain types of news content (such as traffic or entertainment), meteorologists or weather anchors (the latter term often refers to weather presenters that do not have degrees in meteorology earned at an educational institution) who provide weather forecasts – more common in local news and on network morning programs – and sports presenters that report on ongoing, concluded, or upcoming sporting events.

Packages will usually be filmed at a relevant location and edited in an editing suite in a newsroom or a remote contribution edit suite in a location some distance from the newsroom. They may also be edited in mobile editing vans, or satellite vans or trucks (such as electronic news gathering vehicles), and transmitted back to the newsroom. Live coverage will be broadcast from a relevant location and sent back to the newsroom via fixed cable links, microwave radio, production truck, satellite truck, or via online streaming. Roles associated with television news include a technical director, floor director audio technician, and a television crew of operators running character graphics (CG), teleprompters, and professional video cameras. Most news shows are broadcast live.

Radio
Radio news broadcasts can range from as little as one minute to as much as the station's entire schedule, such as the case of all-news radio, or talk radio. Stations dedicated to news or talk content will often feature newscasts, or bulletins, usually at the top of the hour, usually between three and eight minutes in length. They can be a mix of local, regional, national, and international news, as well as sport, entertainment, weather, and traffic reports, or they may be incorporated into separate bulletins. There may also be shorter bulletins at the bottom of the hour, or three at 15-minute intervals, or two at 20-minute intervals. All-news radio stations exist in some countries (most commonly in North America), primarily located in major metropolitan areas such as Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and Toronto, which often broadcast local, national, and international news and feature stories on a set time schedule (sometimes known as a ""wheel"" format, which schedules the presentation of certain segments focused on a specific type of news content at a specific point each hour).

News broadcasting by country

Canada

Terrestrial television
Unlike in the United States, most Canadian television stations have license requirements (enforced by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission) to offer locally produced newscasts (or any local programming, for that matter) in some form. Educational television stations are exempt from these requirements as are multicultural television stations, however some stations licensed as multicultural outlets do produce local newscasts in varied languages (such as the Omni Television station group). Canadian television stations normally broadcast newscasts between two and four times a day: usually at noon; 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 p.m. in the evening, and 11:00 p.m. (there are some variations to this: stations affiliated with CTV usually air their late evening newscasts at 11:30 p.m., due to the scheduling of the network's national evening news program CTV National News at 11:00 p.m. in all time zones; most CBC Television-owned stations formerly carried a 10-minute newscast at 10:55 p.m., following The National, these were expanded to a half-hour and moved to 11:00 p.m. during the fall of 2012).

Some stations carry morning newscasts (usually starting at 5:30 or 6:00 a.m., and ending at 9:00 a.m.). Unlike in the United States, primetime newscasts in the 10:00 p.m. timeslot are relatively uncommon (three Global owned-and-operated stations in Manitoba and Saskatchewan – CKND-DT, CFSK-DT, and CFRE-DT – and Victoria, British Columbia independent station CHEK-DT are the only television stations in the country carrying a primetime newscast); conversely, pre-5:00 a.m. local newscasts are also uncommon in Canada, Hamilton, Ontario independent station CHCH-DT, whose weekdaily programming consists largely of local news, is currently the only station in the country that starts its weekday morning newscasts before 5:30 a.m. (the station's morning news block begins at 4:00 a.m. on weekdays).

Like with U.S. television, many stations use varied titles for their newscasts; this is particularly true with owned-and-operated stations of Global and City (Global's stations use titles based on daypart such as News Hour for the noon and early evening newscasts and News Final for 11:00 p.m. newscasts, while all six City-owned broadcast stations produce morning news/talk programs under the umbrella title Breakfast Television and its flagship station CITY-DT/Toronto's evening newscasts are titled CityNews). Overall umbrella titles for news programming use the titling schemes ""(Network or system name) News"" for network-owned stations or ""(Callsign) News"" for affiliates not directly owned by a network or television system (although the latter title scheme was used on some network-owned stations prior to the early 2000s).

CBC Television, Global, and CTV each produce national evening newscasts (The National, Global National and CTV National News, respectively), which unlike the American network newscasts do not compete with one another in a common timeslot; while Global National airs at the same early evening time slot as the American evening network newscasts, The Nationals 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time slot competes against primetime entertainment programming on the private broadcast networks, while CTV National News airs against locally produced 11:00 p.m. newscasts on other stations. The National, which has aired on CBC Television since 1954, is the longest-running national network newscast in Canada. All three networks also produce weekly newsmagazines: CBC's The Fifth Estate (aired since 1975), Global's 16x9 (aired since 2008), and CTV's W5 (aired since 1966 and currently the longest-running network newsmagazine in Canada).

CTV's Canada AM, which has aired since 1975, is the sole national morning news program on broadcast television in Canada, although it has since been relegated to semi-national status as most CTV owned-and-operated stations west of the Ontario-Manitoba border dropped the program during the summer and fall of 2011 in favor of locally produced morning newscasts. The Sunday morning talk show is relatively uncommon on Canadian television; for many years, the closest program having similarities to the format was CTV's news and interview series Question Period; Global would eventually debut the political affairs show The West Block in November 2011, which closely follows the format.

Cable television
Canada is host to several 24-hour cable news channels, consisting of domestically-operated cable channels and news channels operated outside Canada or North America. Domestic national news channels include CTV News Channel and Sun News Network, which offer general news programming; Business News Network, which carries business news; and The Weather Network, which offers national and local forecasts. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates two national news networks: the English-language CBC News Network and the French-language Réseau de l'information (RDI). Other Canadian specialty news channels broadcasting in French include general news networks Argent and Le Canal Nouvelles, and MétéoMédia, a French-language sister to The Weather Network.

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission authorizes carriage of some cable channels from foreign countries on domestic cable and satellite operators provided that they are linked to a Canadian network. Amongst news channels, all four major U.S. cable news networks: CNN, HLN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel are available on most providers, along with channels from outside North America such as Al Jazeera English from Qatar, BBC World News from the United Kingdom, Deutsche Welle from Germany, and RT from Russia.

Regionally-based news channels are fairly uncommon in Canada in comparison to the United States. Two 24-hour regional news channels currently exist in the country: the Toronto-centered CP24 and the Vancouver-focused Global News: BC 1 (although CHCH-DT, a general entertainment station with a rolling daytime news block on weekdays (currently from 4:00 a.m.-4:30 p.m.) that has existed since August 2009 and hour-long local newscasts nightly at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m., serves as a de facto regional news channel for Southern Ontario's Golden Horseshoe region); CityNews Channel formerly operated as a competitor to CP24, although that channel shut down after a year-and-a-half of operation in May 2013.

United States

Broadcast television

Local newscasts
Local TV stations in the United States normally broadcast local news three to four times a day on average: commonly airing at 4:30, 5:00, 5:30, or 6:00 a.m.; noon; 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. in the early evening; and 10:00 or 11:00 p.m. Some stations carry morning newscasts at 4:00, 7:00, 8:00, or 9:00 a.m., midday newscasts at 11:00 or 11:30 a.m., late afternoon newscasts at 4:00 or 4:30 p.m., or early evening newscasts at 5:30 or 6:30 p.m. Many Fox affiliates, affiliates of minor networks (such as The CW and MyNetworkTV), and independent stations air newscasts in the final hour of primetime (i.e., 10:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones or 9:00 p.m. in the Mountain and Central time zones in the U.S.). Stations that produce local newscasts typically broadcast as little as one to as much over twelve hours of local news on weekdays and as little as one hour to as much as seven hours on weekends; news programming on weekends are typically limited to morning and evening newscasts as the variable scheduling of network sports programming (if a station is affiliated with a network with a sports division) usually prevents most stations from carrying midday newscasts (however a few stations located in the Eastern and Pacific time zones do produce weekend midday newscasts).

From the 1940s to the 1960s, broadcast television stations typically provided local news programs only one to two times each evening for 15 minutes (the normal length for many locally produced programs at the time); usually these programs aired as supplements to network-supplied evening news programs or leadouts for primetime programming. Reports featured on local and national television newscasts during this time were generally provided via film or still photography; eventually, videotape began to be used to provide live coverage of news events. The 1950s also saw the first use of airborne newsgathering; most notably, in 1958, Los Angeles television station KTLA began operating the ""Telecopter"", a helicopter equipped for newsgathering use that was the most advanced airborne television broadcast device of its time.

The modern-day coverage of major breaking news events came to fruition following the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963; the news of Kennedy's death was first announced by Eddie Barker, the news director at KRLD-TV (now KDFW) in Dallas, who passed along word from an official at Parkland Hospital; Barker's scoop appeared live simultaneously on CBS and ABC as a result of a local press pool arrangement. Many local and national news organizations such as Dallas station WFAA-TV and CBS News provided continuous coverage of the events and aftermath for five days. The November 24, 1963 assassination of Kennedy's accused killer Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby was fed to NBC by a remote unit on loan to its Dallas affiliate WBAP-TV (now KXAS-TV) from competitor KTVT, and was the first murder to have been witnessed live on U.S. network television. The coverage provided by the local stations eventually led to further investments and technological developments to provide real-time news; newsgathering vehicles equipped with satellites began to be used on the local and national levels beginning in the 1970s. During the 1960s and 1970s, many stations began to provide additional news programming, beginning with midday news programs; in the late 1970s, the first local morning news programs debuted.

Additional changes in local news content came during the 1980s and 1990s; in January 1989, WSVN in Miami became the first to adopt a news-intensive programming format; rather than fill its schedule with syndicated content as other Fox stations did at the time it joined that network, Ed Ansin (owner of WSVN parent Sunbeam Television) chose instead to heavily invest in the station's news department, and replace national newscasts and late-prime time network programs vacated as a result of losing its NBC affiliation (the byproduct of an affiliation switch caused by CBS and WSVN's former network partner NBC buying other stations in the market) with additional newscasts. This model was eventually replicated by many other stations affiliated with the post-1986 television networks as well as some news-producing independent stations (beginning with Fox's 1994 deals with New World Communications and SF Broadcasting that saw several major network stations change their affiliations), and also resulted in even NBC, CBS, and ABC affiliates adopting similar scheduling formats (tweaked to account for the larger amount of network programming that those networks carry). In 1990, WEWS-TV in Cleveland conceived a concept known as the ""24-Hour News Source"" (which has its origins in a news format used by short-lived Boston independent station WXPO-TV when it signed on in 1969), in which supplementary 30-second long news updates were produced at or near the top of each hour outside regular long-form newscasts during local commercial break inserts shown within network and syndicated programming. The format spread to other U.S. television stations (most notably, WISH-TV in Indianapolis, one of the few remaining users of the concept), most of which eventually disposed of the hourly update format by the early 2000s.

Since the early 1990s, independent stations and stations affiliated with a non-Big Three network have entered into ""news share agreements,"" in which news production is outsourced to a major network station (usually an affiliate of ABC, NBC, or CBS), often to avoid shouldering the cost of starting a news department from scratch or because of a lack of studio space. These commonly involve Fox, CW, and MyNetworkTV affiliates (and previously affiliate stations of the now-defunct predecessors of the latter two networks, The WB and UPN) and in some cases, independent stations; however such agreements exist in certain markets between two co-owned/co-managed Big Three affiliates. News share agreements are most common with stations co-owned with a larger network affiliate or whose operations are jointly managed through a shared service or local marketing agreement. In cases where a station with an existing news department enters into a news share agreement, it will result either the two departments merging or the outright conversion of newscast production from in-house to outsourced production. Minor network affiliates involved in news share agreements will often carry far fewer hours of local newscasts than would be conceivable with an in-house news department to avoid competition with the outsourcing partner's own newscasts, as a result, minor network affiliates involved in these NSAs often will carry a morning newscast from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. (in competition with the national network newscasts instead of airing competing with the Big Three affiliates' newscasts) or a primetime newscast at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific or 9:00 p.m. Central and Mountain Time, with limited to no newscasts in other traditional news time periods (midday, late afternoon, or early evening).

Because of the increased presence of duopolies and outsourcing agreements since the early 2000s, the number of minor network affiliates and independent stations that produce their own newscasts has markedly decreased compared to when duopolies were barred under Federal Communications Commission rules prior to 2000 (as of 2013, there are at least 15 minor network affiliates or independent stations that produce their own local newscasts, most are located within the 20 largest U.S. media markets). Duopolies and outsourcing agreements have also affected Fox stations in a similar manner; although Fox is considered to be a major network on the same level as NBC, ABC, and CBS and has urged its affiliates since the early 1990s to broadcast local news, about half of its stations broadcast local news programming through news share agreements with many of the remainder operating their own news departments. Several stations affiliated with Spanish-language networks (such as Univision and Telemundo) also broadcast their own newscasts, these stations often produce a substantially lower weekly newscast output compared to its English-language counterparts (usually limited to half-hour broadcasts in the evening, and often airing only on weeknights).

Unlike international broadcast stations which tend to brand under uniform newscast titles based solely on network affiliation, U.S. television stations tend to use varying umbrella titles for their newscasts; some title their newscasts utilizing the station's on-air branding (such as combining the network affiliation and channel number with the word ""News""), others use franchised brand names (like Eyewitness News, Action News and NewsChannel) for their news programming. Conversely, the naming conventions for a station's newscast are sometimes used as a universal on-air branding for the station itself, and may be used for general promotional purposes, even used in promoting syndicated and network programming (such as KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which uses the uniform news and general branding NewsChannel 4). Many stations title their newscasts with catchy names like Daybreak, Good Morning (city or region name), First at Four, Live at Five, Eleven @ 11:00, or Nightcast. These names are intended to set one station apart from the rest, especially for viewers who are chosen for audience measurement surveys. If the respondent was unable to provide a channel number or call letters, the newscast title is often enough for the appropriate station to receive Nielsen ratings credit.

Network world news programs
The Big Three broadcast television networks produce morning and evening national newscasts. These newscasts are focused on world news, national news, and sometimes local news items that have some national significance. (America This Morning, Good Morning America, and ABC World News are broadcast by ABC, CBS broadcasts the CBS Morning News, CBS This Morning, and the CBS Evening News, and NBC produces Early Today, Today, and NBC Nightly News) as well as weekly newsmagazine series (NBC's Dateline; ABC's 20/20 and Nightline; and CBS's CBS News Sunday Morning, 48 Hours, and 60 Minutes). 

Network morning newscasts usually air at 7:00 a.m. (English-language network morning shows air live in the Eastern Time Zone and tape delayed for the remaining time zones, while the Spanish-language morning shows air live in the Eastern, Central, and Mountain time zones and are tape delayed in the Pacific Time Zone); network evening newscasts usually are broadcast live at 6:30 p.m. on the East Coast and broadcast live in both the Eastern and Central Time Zones, with a secondary live broadcast (otherwise known as a 'Western Edition"") at 6:30 p.m. Pacific Time. Today was the first morning news program to be broadcast on American television and in the world, when it debuted on January 14, 1952; the earliest national evening news program was The Walter Compton News, a short-lived 15-minute newscast that aired on the DuMont Television Network from 1947 to 1948.

All four major English networks and the two largest Spanish networks also carry political talk programs on Sunday mornings (NBC's Meet the Press, ABC's This Week, CBS' Face the Nation, Fox's sole news program Fox News Sunday, Univision's Al Punto, and Telemundo's Enfoque); of these programs, Meet the Press holds the distinction of being the longest-running American television program as it has aired since November 6, 1947. The U.S. is one of the few countries in which broadcast networks provide overnight or early morning national news programs, in addition to those airing in the morning and early evening. CBS and ABC are currently the only networks that produce overnight news programs on weeknights in the form of Up to the Minute and World News Now, respectively; NBC previously produced overnight newscasts at different times, both of which have since been cancelled: NBC News Overnight from 1982 to 1983, and NBC Nightside from 1991 to 1998 (NBC currently does not offer a late night newscast, although the network currently airs rebroadcasts of the fourth hour of Today, and sister network CNBC's Mad Money on weeknights).

Spanish-language news programs are provided by Univision, which produces early and late evening editions of its flagship evening news program Noticiero Univision seven nights a week (and was the only nightly newscast on the major Spanish networks until Telemundo resumed its weekend newscasts in October 2014), along with weekday afternoon newsmagazine Primer Impacto and weekday morning program Despierta America); Telemundo, which has a daily flagship evening newscast Noticiero Telemundo, along with weekday morning program Un Nuevo Día and weekday afternoon newsmagazine Al Rojo Vivo; MundoFox, which produces the weekday-only flagship newscast Noticias MundoFox, along with a weekday afternoon newsmagazine MundoFox ¡Y Ya!; Estrella TV, which produces the weekday-only flagship news program Noticiero Estrella TV and the primetime newscast Cierre de Edición; and Azteca América, which produces morning, early and late evening newscasts on weekdays under the umbrella title Hechos. In the cases of Univision and Telemundo, both of their evening news programs compete with national evening news programs on their English-language competitors.

Fox, The CW, and MyNetworkTV do not produce national morning and evening news programs (although Fox made a brief attempt at a morning program from 1996 to 1997 with Fox After Breakfast; many CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates and independent stations air the syndicated news program The Daily Buzz, while some Tribune Broadcasting-owned CW and MyNetworkTV stations air a similar program called EyeOpener).

Cable television

24-hour news channels are devoted to current events around the clock. They are often referred to as cable news channels. The originator of this format from which the name derives is CNN (which following its 1980 launch, spun off other national and international networks using the brand such as CNN International, CNN en Español, and CNN-IBN), originally standing for Cable News Network in reference to the then-new phenomenon of cable television. As satellite and other forms of television have evolved, the term ""cable news"" has become something of an anachronism, but is still in common use; many other television channels have since been established, such as BBC World News, BBC News Channel, Sky News, Al Jazeera, Newsmax TV, ABC News 24, France 24, STAR News, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC. Some news channels specialize even further, such as ESPNews (sports news; sister channel to ESPN); The Weather Channel (weather, although its status as a specialty news channel has become ambiguous due to its recent incorporation of non-news entertainment programming) and WeatherNation (weather); CNBC, Bloomberg Television, and Fox Business Network (financial news).

Conversely, several cable news channels exist that carry news reports specifically geared toward a particular metropolitan area, region, or state such as New York City's NY1 (which focuses on the entire New York metropolitan area) and News 12 Networks (which serves portions of the area outside Manhattan), Orlando's News 13 (which is also carried in areas surrounding Greater Orlando), Tampa, Florida's Bay News 9, and Washington, D.C.'s NewsChannel 8. These channels are usually owned by a local cable operator and are distributed solely through cable television and IPTV system operators. Some broadcast television stations also operate cable channels (some of which are repeated through digital multicasting) that air the station's local newscasts in the form of live simulcasts from the television station, with rebroadcasts of the newscasts airing in time periods between the live broadcasts.

A term which has entered common parlance to differentiate cable news from traditional news broadcasts is network news, in reference to the traditional television networks on which such broadcasts air. A classic example is the cable news channel MSNBC, which overlaps with (and, in the case of very significant breaking news events, pre-empts) its network counterpart NBC News; in some cases, viewers may have trouble differentiating between the cable channel and either a counterpart network news organization or a local news operation, such as is the case with Fox News Channel and the Fox network's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates (most of which use the Fox (channel #) News brand for their newscasts), due to the network's controversially perceived conservative-leaning political content that differs from the Fox broadcast stations' independent and generally nonpartisan reporting. Most U.S. cable news networks do not air news programming 24 hours a day, often filling late afternoon, primetime, and late night hours with news-based talk programs, documentaries, and other specialty programming.

Radio

More often, AM radio stations will air a 6½-minute newscast at the top of the hour, which can be either a local report, a national report from a radio network such as CBS Radio, CNN Radio, NPR, Fox News Radio, or ABC News Radio, or a mix of both local and national content, including weather and traffic reports. Some stations also air a two-minute report at the bottom of the hour.

FM stations, unless they feature a talk radio format, usually only air an abbreviated weather forecast. Some also air minute-long news capsules featuring a quick review of events, and usually only in drive time periods or in critical emergencies, since FM stations usually focus more on playing music. Traffic reports also air on FM stations, depending on the market.

In some countries, radio news content may be syndicated by a website or company to many stations in a particular region or even the entire country. A notable example is Israel, where there are groups of radio stations that broadcast the same hourly news capsule by an Israeli news website and television station. There are currently two groups of local Israeli stations: one broadcasts news from YNET, the other broadcasts them from Channel 10. Israeli Army Radio general public stations broadcast the same news capsule every hour, and IBA's Kol Israel stations broadcast theirs.

"Ballymena

Ballymena  (, ) is a town in County Antrim, and the eighth largest in Northern Ireland. It is part of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim. It had a population of 29,551 people at the 2011 Census.

The town is built on land given to the Adair family by King Charles I in 1626, on the basis that the town holds two annual fairs and a free Saturday market in perpetuity. , the Saturday market still runs. It is a popular shopping hub within Northern Ireland and is home to Ballymena United F.C.

Ballymena incorporates an area of  and is home to large villages such as Cullybackey, Galgorm, Ahoghill and Broughshane. The town used to host Ireland's largest one-day agricultural show at the Ballymena Showgrounds. The town centre has many historic buildings. The Town Hall was built in 1924 on the site of the old Market House, and was refurbished in 2007 at a cost of roughly £20 million.

History

Early history
The recorded history of the Ballymena area dates to the Early Christian period from the 5th to the 7th centuries. Ringforts are found in the townland of Ballykeel and a site known as Camphill Fort in the townland of Ballee may also have been of this type. There are a number of souterrain sites within a  radius of the centre of Ballymena.

 north in the townland of Kirkinriola, the ancient parish church and graveyard possess several indicators of Early Christian settlement, including a souterrain. Also in 1868, a gravedigger found a large stone slab on which was carved a cross with the inscription ord do degen. This refers to Bishop Degen, who lived in Ireland during the 7th century. This stone is now in the porch of St. Patrick's Church of Ireland, at the end of Castle Street.

At the end of the 5th century, a church was founded in Connor,  south of Ballymena. This was followed by a monastery at Templemoyle, Kells. In 831, however, the Norse invaded the Ballymena area and burned the church.

In the 12th century, the Normans conquered much of County Antrim and County Down after having taken over England the century before. They created the core of the Earldom of Ulster. During this campaign, they built great mounds of earth topped by wooden towers, referred to as mottes, as defensive structures. The Harryville (Ulster-Scots: Herrieville) area's motte-and-bailey is one of the best examples of this type of fortification in Northern Ireland. Some sources, however, credit the Uí Fhloinn with building the mid-Antrim mottes and baileys in imitation of the invaders; the Uí Fhloinn defeated and repelled the Earl of Ulster, John de Courcy, in 1177 and 1178.

In 1315, Edward Bruce (brother of King Robert I of Scotland, known as ""Robert Bruce"") invaded Ireland. On 10 September 1315, at the Battle of Tawnybrack ( south of Ballymena at Kells), Edward conquered the army of Richard De Burgo, the Norman Earl of Ulster.

Post-medieval
In 1576, Queen Elizabeth I granted land, including the town of Ballymena, to Sir Thomas Smith. The lands had been forfeited to the crown after Shane O'Neill's resistance in the 1560s. Smith brought English settlers to the area, among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. By 1581, Smith's settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.

On 10 May 1607, King James I granted the native Irish chief, Ruairí Óg MacQuillan the Ballymena Estate. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland. The estate was temporarily renamed ""Kinhilstown"" after Adair's lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early 17th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid. In 1626 Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate; they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.

In 1641, the local Ballymena garrison were defeated by Irish rebels in the battle of Bundooragh. Ballymena's first market house (on the site of the present town hall) was built in 1684.

In 1690, the Duke of Württemberg, a Williamite general, used Galgorm Castle as his headquarters. Sir Robert Adair raised a Regiment of Foot for King William III and fought at the Battle of the Boyne.

By 1704, the population of Ballymena had reached 800. In 1707, the first Protestant (Church of Ireland) parish church was built. In 1740, the original Ballymena Castle burned down. The Gracehill Moravian settlement was founded in 1765. During the 1798 rebellion, Ballymena was occupied from 7 to 9 June by a force of around 10,000 United Irishmen. They stormed the Market House (now the Town Hall), killing three of its defenders.

The first modern Roman Catholic Church in Ballymena was consecrated in 1827. By 1834 the population of Ballymena was about 4,000. In 1848 the Belfast and Ballymena Railway was established. In 1865 Robert Alexander Shafto Adair (late Baron Waveney) started building Ballymena Castle, a magnificent family residence, in the Demesne. The castle was not completed until 1887.

In 1870 The People's Park was established.

Twentieth century

In 1900, Ballymena assumed urban status. Under the provisions of the Irish Land Act of 1903, the Adairs disposed of most of their Ballymena estate to the occupying tenants in 1904. The ""old"" town hall building, which also contained the post office and estate office, burned down in 1919. Prince Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI) laid the cornerstone to the new town hall on 24 July 1924, and it was officially opened on 20 November 1928.

The Urban District Council petitioned for borough status and the Charter was granted in December 1937. The first meeting of councillors as a borough Council was held on 23 May 1939. The population of Ballymena reached 13,000. Ballymena Castle was demolished in the 1950s. In 1973, the Urban and Rural District Councils were merged to create  Ballymena Borough Council. Following local government reoganisation in 2015, the Borough Council was merged with the Boroughs of Carrickfergus Borough Council and Larne Borough Council. During the Second World War, Ballymena was home to a large number of evacuees from Gibraltar. They were housed with local families.

In the 1950s St Patrick's Barracks in Ballymena was the Regimental Training Depot of the Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th). Many young men who had been conscripted on the United Kingdom mainland, along with others who had volunteered for service in the British Army, embarked upon their period of basic training in the Regimental Depot, prior to being posted to the regular regimental battalions. Many of these young men were to serve in Korea, Cyprus and with the British Army of the Rhine. In 1968 due to a series of government austerity measures, the remaining three Irish regiments, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers (27th) Royal Ulster Rifles (83rd & 86th) and the Royal Irish Fusiliers (89th) merged to become the Royal Irish Rangers. Early in the 1990s the Royal Irish Regiment, whose Regimental Headquarters was at St Patrick's Barracks, was granted the Freedom of the Borough.

Like other towns in Northern Ireland, Ballymena was affected by the Troubles, a lengthy period of religious and partisan tensions and armed confrontations from the 1960s through 1998. A total of eleven people were killed in or near the town by the IRA and various loyalist groups.

During the later half of the 20th century, Ballymena, like many other once prosperous industrial centres in Northern Ireland, experienced economic change and industrial restructuring; many of its former factories closed. Since the 2010s Ballymena has seen a decline in its retail and manufacturing sectors. Both Michelin and JTI have left the area. Local firm Wrightbus is also struggling citing a downturn in orders. It is hoped that the creation of a manufacturing hub at the former Michelin site will attract businesses to the area.

In March 2000, the actor Liam Neeson, a native of Ballymena, was offered the freedom of the borough by the council, which approved the action by a 12–9 vote. The Democratic Unionist Party objected to the offer and drew attention to his comments from an interview in 1999 with an American political magazine, George. Neeson declined the award, citing tensions, and affirmed he was proud of his connection to the town. Ian Paisley was eventually made a freeman of Ballymena in December 2004 instead.

Ballymena is described by some observers as being at the heart of Northern Ireland's equivalent of the Bible Belt. It has a large Protestant majority. In the early 1990s the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)-dominated town council banned a performance by the ELO Part II in the township, saying they would attract ""the four Ds Drink, Drugs, Devil and Debauchery"". The Council banned the screening of Brokeback Mountain (2005), starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger, as it featured a homosexual relationship. An impersonator of comic Roy 'Chubby' Brown was also banned.

The majority of the town's Catholic population is situated around the Broughshane and Cushendall Road areas. Recently there has been tension in the Dunclug area of the town which now has a Catholic majority. These tensions have been associated with internment bonfires and the flying of republican flags; the town has tried to reduce tensions.

Recreational drugs have been a major problem in the town, earning it the moniker ""the drugs capital of the North"". However major steps have been taken in recent times to deal with this.

In 2011 it was revealed that Ballymena has the third-highest level of legal gun ownership in Northern Ireland.

Slemish Mountain

Ballymena is about  from Slemish Mountain, the legendary first-known Irish home of Saint Patrick. The mountain rises about  above the surrounding plain, and it is the central core of an extinct volcano, commonly known as a volcanic plug. According to legend, following Patrick's capture and being brought as a slave to Ireland, the young man worked as a shepherd at Slemish Mountain for about six years, from ages 16 through 22, for a man named Milchu (or Miluic).

During this time Patrick turned to frequent prayer in his loneliness. In a vision he was encouraged to escape and return home. He did, became a Christian priest and returned to Ireland, allegedly to convert his old master. The legend tells that his true conversion occurred when he was on Slemish out in all weathers, communing with nature and praying continuously. As Patrick was not the first Christian bishop to visit Ireland, his ministry was confined to the North. Here he established churches and an episcopal system. One such church is thought to have been founded at the nearby site of Skerry Churchyard.

Large animals have been reported.

Slemish Mountain is open year-round, and on Saint Patrick's Day (17 March), large crowds hike to the top of the mountain as a pilgrimage. The 1.5-kilometre round walk to the summit and back takes approximately one hour in good weather. Excellent views can be had of the Antrim and Scottish coasts to the East. Ballymena town, Lough Neagh and the Sperrin Mountains are all normally visible to the West whilst the Bann Valley and the higher summits of the Antrim Hills can be seen to the North.

Troubles

Ballymena, throughout the course of The Troubles, had a large paramilitary presence in the town. The UDA South East Antrim Brigade was stationed here.

Economy

Ballymena was traditionally market town. The 1980s were a time of job losses in Ballymena as industry suffered and this has reoccurred in the 2010s

Notable employers were Michelin in Broughshane,  JTI Gallaher  in Galgorm and Wrightbus

November 2012, the Patton Group, a major builder entered administration with the loss of 320 jobs.

October 2014  JTI Gallagher's would be closing with a loss of 877 jobs.

November 2015 Michelin decided to close their Ballymena factory after 50 years, resulting in the loss of up to 850 jobs.

"Stationers' Register

The Stationers’ Register was a record book maintained by the Stationers' Company of London.  The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including  printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in England.  The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of copyright law.  The Company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books.

For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries—for the Elizabethan era, the Jacobean era, the Caroline era, and especially for English Renaissance theatre—the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the Master of the Revels (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.

By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work.  One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and Nathaniel Butter claimed the right to print ""A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde."" (They paid sixpence.)

Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the companies of actors appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.   

In 1710, the Copyright Act or Statute of Anne entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register.  The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000.

"Murder of Anni Dewani

Anni Ninna Dewani (née Hindocha; 12 March 1982 – 13 November 2010) was a Swedish woman of Indian origin who was murdered while on her honeymoon in South Africa after the taxi in which she and her husband were travelling was hijacked.

Arrests were made in the days following  the crime; hijackers Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni, and hotel receptionist Monde Mbolombo admitted to their involvement in an unintentionally  fatal robbery and kidnapping. Facing life in prison, Qwabe and Mbolombo later changed their stories to allege the crime had been a premeditated murder for hire at the behest of Anni's husband Shrien Dewani. Taxi driver Zola Tongo initially claimed to be an innocent victim of the incident but, faced with the weight of evidence implicating him in the crime and in the wake of his fellow conspirators' allegations of a ""murder for hire"" plot, he too changed his story to allege the husband was the instigator. Attractive plea bargains were offered to the conspirators in exchange for future testimony in legal proceedings related to the crime. The allegation of the husband's involvement made global headlines; Shrien Dewani's supporters emphatically denied the accusations, saying it was ""ludicrous"" to suggest he had solicited an attack on his wife from the first taxi driver he met within hours of their arrival in Cape Town.

Zola Tongo pleaded guilty to murder in December 2010 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.  Mziwamadoda Qwabe pleaded guilty to murder in August 2012 and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.  Xolile Mngeni was tried and convicted of murder in November 2012 and was sentenced to life in prison. Monde Mbolombo admitted his involvement but was offered immunity in exchange for testimony against the other men alleged to have been involved in the crime.

South African prosecutors formulated charges against Shrien Dewani based on the later-discredited confessions of Tongo, Qwabe and Mbolombo, who were found to have committed perjury. Charges were brought on the basis Anni had been the victim of a premeditated kidnapping and murder for hire that was staged to appear as a random carjacking at the alleged behest of her husband. Following a long legal battle, Shrien was extradited from the UK to South Africa to face trial. He was exonerated by a Western Cape High Court, which in December 2014 ruled there was no credible evidence to support the allegations against him nor to support the allegation the crime was a premeditated murder for hire.

Background

Anni Dewani
The Hindocha family was forced to leave Uganda in the early 1970s after the country's president Idi Amin expelled all Asians living there. They were granted residence in Sweden and settled in Mariestad, where their daughter Anni was born and raised.

Marriage
Anni Hindocha met Shrien Dewani in London in 2009; they maintained a long-distance relationship until Hindocha moved to the UK in March 2010, where they became engaged in May that year. The couple, whose relationship was sometimes troubled, married at Lake Powai near Mumbai, India, on 29 October 2010. They were planning to hold a civil ceremony in the UK in 2011 for friends who could not attend their wedding in India.

Robbery, kidnapping and murder

After landing at Cape Town International Airport on 7 November 2010, Dewani and her husband took a domestic flight and stayed at Kruger National Park for four nights. On 12 November, the couple returned to Cape Town International Airport, where they met and engaged taxi driver Zola Tongo to drive them to the five-star Cape Grace Hotel.

On 13 November, having retained Tongo as a tour guide, the couple were driven through the city in his VW Sharan into Gugulethu. Tongo drove past a BBQ restaurant (Mzolis) and they continued to Surfside Restaurant in Strand, where the couple dined. After their meal, Tongo drove the Dewanis back into Gugulethu. Shortly after turning off the main road, two armed men hijacked the vehicle. After driving a short distance, Tongo was ejected from the taxi. Shrien Dewani was robbed of his money, wallet, designer watch and mobile telephone, and after being driven for about 20 minutes, he was also ejected from the vehicle. On the street, a bystander assisted him by calling the police.

At 07:50 on 14 November, in Lingelethu West, Anni Dewani was found dead in the back of the VW Sharan taxi. She had suffered a single gunshot wound to her neck. Police later confirmed Anni's Giorgio Armani wristwatch, a white-gold and diamond bracelet, her handbag and her BlackBerry mobile telephone were missing, and assumed they were stolen. The items stolen in the robbery had an estimated value of R90,000.

Post-mortem examination, repatriation and cremation
Anni Dewani's body was taken to a Cape Town hospital.  The post-mortem examination revealed bruising on her inner leg, indicating she had been involved in a struggle. It also indicated she had died from a single gunshot that passed through her hand and neck, severing an artery. There was no sign of sexual assault. On 17 November, Dewani's body was released by the South African authorities and returned to the United Kingdom on a British Airways flight, accompanied by her husband.  Six months after her death, in a Hindu ceremony, her family scattered her ashes in her favourite area of the Vänern lake, close to her home town, Mariestad, Sweden.

Investigation: sequence of arrests and confessions
As a result of a palm print found on the abandoned taxi, Xolile Mngeni was arrested on Tuesday 16 November 2010. Mngeni made a videotaped confession in the presence of Captain Jonker of the South African Police Service, admitting involvement in a hijack, armed robbery and kidnapping operation. He described Shrien and Anni Dewani as victims and said Qwabe shot Anni Dewani during a struggle for her handbag.

Mziwamadoda Qwabe was arrested at around 01:00 on Thursday 18 November 2010 as a result of a tip-off from a trusted township informant. After initial denials, Qwabe was allowed to consult with arrested co-conspirators Mbolombo and Mngeni, and subsequently admitted involvement in the hijack, armed robbery and kidnapping. He described Shrien and Anni Dewani as victims. He changed his story during an interview recorded at 17:21 that day, saying the incident was a murder planned at the behest of Shrien Dewani.

Monde Mbolombo was arrested in the early hours of Thursday 18 November 2010 as a result of Qwabe providing his name to the police. After initially denying involvement, Mbolombo made a recorded confession at 16:30, admitting arranging a hijacking and armed robbery operation. The confession did not mention a planned murder or Shrien Dewani's involvement. The following day, Mbolombo changed his story, saying the operation was a planned murder at the behest of Shrien Dewani.

Taxi driver Zola Tongo reported the hijacking to a police station in Gugulethu after he was ejected from the vehicle, and made a statement saying he was an unknowing victim. On 17 November, Tongo gave a statement to Officer Hendrikse of the SAPS, again saying he was an innocent victim. The following day, Tongo appointed attorney William De Grass, and  on Saturday 20 November he surrendered to police and said the operation was a planned murder that was staged to appear as a random hijacking at the behest of Shrien Dewani.

Media coverage
In South Africa, there was much media coverage of the case following the discovery of the body. With an economy reliant on tourism, tour operators reported an immediate drop in bookings as potential visitors became aware of the country's murder rate; on average, 46 per day. There were also concerns the killing would negate the goodwill resulting from the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The assignment of the Police Hawks team, and the early arrests, conviction and statement implicating Shrien Dewani led to increased  media coverage.

BBC Panorama episode 
An episode of the BBC television documentary series Panorama in March 2012 reported that the original South African post-mortem report showed the bullet that killed Anni Dewani had passed through her left hand followed by her chest, and that the wound on her neck was an exit wound. The report said the bullet left ""an irregular gunshot exit wound"", which suggested there had been a struggle. A second Panorama programme broadcast in September 2013 revisited the case and highlighted numerous inconsistencies between the physical evidence, witness testimony, and the South African prosecutors' purported version of events. In particular it said the forensic evidence had not been collected properly and that it indicated an accidental shooting during a struggle rather than a deliberate killing.

Trials, convictions and sentencing

Plea bargains
Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Zola Tongo were offered reduced sentences in exchange for guilty pleas and the promise of truthful testimony against Shrien Dewani and in other criminal proceedings related to the crime. These plea deals were granted in accordance with Section 105A of the Criminal Procedure Act. Monde Mbolombo was granted full immunity from prosecution in exchange for his promise of truthful testimony against Shrien Dewani and in other criminal proceedings related to the crime. This plea deal was granted in accordance with Section 204 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

Conviction and sentencing of Zola Tongo 
On 7 December 2010, Zola Tongo appeared in the Western Cape High Court; in accordance with his plea deal under Section 105A of the Criminal Procedure Act, he pleaded guilty to the armed robbery, kidnapping and murder of Anni Dewani—crimes he alleged were committed at the behest of Shrien Dewani. According to the terms of his Section 105A agreement, Tongo was sentenced to 18 years in prison, contingent on him testifying truthfully against Dewani in any future legal proceedings.

Tongo was expected to give evidence in the trials of Mngeni and Qwabe in 2011 and 2012. Qwabe avoided trial by pleading guilty pursuant to a Section 105A plea deal. Tongo was not called as a witness at Mngeni's trial in 2012.

, Tongo was serving his 18-year sentence in Malmesbury Prison, and will be eligible for release in 2019.

Conviction and sentencing of Mziwamadoda Qwabe
In pre-trial hearings on 18 February at Wynberg Magistrates Court, counsel for Mziwamadoda Qwabe said the court was unable to provide a fair trial for his client. Thabo Nogemane said, ""I am instructed that some unknown police officer assaulted him by means of a big torch. He was hit all over his body. He said the statement was a suggestion put to him by the police. They already had the allegations so they told him: 'Just sign here'. I wouldn't refer to it as a confession, just a statement."" According to the terms of his Section 105A agreement, Qwabe was sentenced to 25 years in prison, contingent on him testifying truthfully in future legal proceedings relating to the case. Qwabe will be eligible for release in 2027.

Trial of Xolile Mngeni and surrounding events

In 2011, Mngeni's lawyer Vusi Tshabalala said his client had been suffocated with a plastic bag before signing a statement admitting his involvement in the killing, further saying police resorted to ""irregular methods"" because of the pressure they were under to solve the high-profile case. The start of Mngeni's trial was delayed, and on 13 June 2011 it was announced he had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour.

Despite having admitted to his role in the robbery and kidnapping of Anni Dewani in a videotaped confession, Mngeni pleaded not guilty at the start of his 2012 trial, saying he had an alibi and was not at the scene of the crime. Mngeni's lawyers said his initial confession should be ruled inadmissible as evidence because it was allegedly extracted using torture. Justice Robert Henney ruled against Mngeni and said the confession was admissible. Before testifying in the Mngeni trial, key witness Monde Mbolombo read out a prepared statement confessing to lying in his two previous affidavits and promised to tell the truth when testifying.

On 19 November 2012, Mngeni was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in jail. The court accepted Mziwamadoda Qwabe's and Monde Mbolombo's version of events, according to which the crime was a contract killing. Mngeni was ruled to have been the person who shot Anni Dewani. The court's findings were superseded by the judgement in the later trial of Shrien Dewani, in which the court found the earlier determinations had been made on the basis of flawed forensic evidence, and perjury of Qwabe and Mbolombo, the two key witnesses.

In July 2014, it was confirmed that a medical parole application had been made for Mngeni, who was terminally ill with a brain tumour. He was denied parole and died in jail at the Goodwood Centre of Excellence on 18 October 2014.

Extradition and trial of Shrien Dewani

After a long legal battle, Shrien Dewani was extradited from the United Kingdom to South Africa on 7 April 2014. Upon arrival he was arrested, charged and ordered to stand trial for allegedly arranging the murder of his wife. He was charged with five offences; conspiracy to commit kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, murder, kidnapping and obstructing the administration of justice. He pleaded not guilty to all five charges.

Dewani's trial began on 6 October 2014. Under cross examination, the key witnesses who alleged Dewani's involvement—Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Monde Mbolombo—contradicted their previous statements and each other on most of the key elements of the ""murder for hire"" story. Tongo and Mbolombo were found to have fabricated telephone calls and text messages that did not exist and refused to identify a fifth conspirator referred to in taped recordings. Qwabe refused to explain to the court why Anni was driven into a residential area.

On 24 November 2014, after the close of the prosecution's case, Dewani's counsel argued for the case to be dismissed under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Act, citing a lack of credible evidence linking his client to the crime. On 8 December, the application for dismissal under Section 174 was granted by the Honourable Judge Traverso; Dewani was acquitted and exonerated of all involvement with the crimes. In her judgement, Traverso ruled there was no credible evidence linking Shrien Dewani to the crime and explained her ruling by saying:

The court overturned the finding of Justice Henney in the Mngeni trial, ruling that Xolile Mngeni could not have been the person who shot Anni, and that some of the key conclusions reached in the 2012 Mngeni trial were erroneous, being based on flawed forensic evidence and the admitted lies of Monde Mbolombo.  The court also ruled that Monde Mbolombo had again committed perjury and would not be granted indemnity from prosecution. Judge Traverso said, ""Before Mr. Mbolombo proceeded with his evidence, he delivered a pre-prepared speech which, from the record, appears to be virtually identical to a similarly emotive speech which he gave the court in the Mngeni trial, before blatantly lying about material aspects.""

Monde Mbolombo
Monde Mbolombo has not been prosecuted or punished for his self-confessed role in the crime, nor for his self-confessed perjury whilst testifying. On 19 November 2015 the Director of Public Prosecutions decided Mbolombo could not be prosecuted.

Complaint about judicial conduct
On 22 January 2015, a complaint was lodged by the Higher Education Transformation Network (HETN), alleging judicial bias and prejudiced behaviour of Judge Traverso in the trial of Shrien Dewani. On 25 April that year, a Judicial Conduct Committee dismissed the HETN's complaint, describing it as ""frivolous"" and lacking in substance. The National Prosecuting Authority declined to appeal the judgement or lodge any complaint against Judge Traverso.

Coroner's inquest
After Shrien Dewani's exoneration in December 2014, Anni Dewani's family asked for a coroner's court in the UK to reopen the inquest into her death and to compel Dewani to publicly answer questions. On 9 September 2015, at Brent Coroner's Court in North London, Coroner Andrew Walker said he did not consider a full inquest was appropriate because a criminal trial had been conducted in South Africa. On 9 October, Walker confirmed there was insufficient cause to resume an inquest. He told the court he was prohibited from reaching a conclusion that was inconsistent with the findings of the South African courts.

Hindocha family statement

On 4 August 2018, Anni Hindocha's uncle, acting as spokesperson for the Hindocha family in response to media reports of Shrien Dewani's same-sex relationship, said: ""We accept he did not murder Anni, but he lied to us and had a very secret gay life. He owes us an apology for his lies"".

"Buddleja alternifolia

Buddleja alternifolia, known as alternate-leaved butterfly-bush, is a species of flowering plant in the figwort family, which is endemic to Gansu, China. A substantial deciduous shrub growing to  tall and wide, it bears grey-green leaves and graceful pendent racemes of scented lilac flowers in summer.

Description

B. alternifolia is a vigorous deciduous shrub reaching  tall with long, slender, pendulous stems. The leaves are alternate, entire, and lanceolate, 4–10 cm long by 0.6–1 cm wide, glabrous and dark green above. The inflorescences of the plants in cultivation are bright lilac-purple, and comprise flowers so densely crowded in clusters along the branch as to often obscure it. However, specimens from the Tsangpo valley in Tibet originally named B. tsetangensis by Marquand have creamy flowers. Flowering occurs in early summer; the flowers are fragrant, but less so than other buddlejas. 2n = 38.

In its native territory it grows along river banks in thickets at elevations of .

Taxonomy
In his 1979 revision of the taxonomy of the African and Asiatic species of Buddleja, the Dutch botanist Anthonius Leeuwenberg sank two species, B. legendrei and B. tsetangensis, as B. alternifolia on the basis of the similarity in the individual flowers, dismissing the variations in plant structure, flower colour  and leaf as attributable to environmental factors. It was Leeuwenberg's taxonomy which was adopted in the Flora of China published in 1996. Until DNA analysis can prove otherwise, it is this classification which is accepted here.

Cultivation
In the West this plant was first described and named by the Russian botanist Carl Maximowicz  in 1880. It was not introduced to cultivation in the West until 1915, by Purdom and Farrer.

The species has become very common in cultivation, a popular shrub for the larger garden, and is readily available from most garden centres in the UK. Fully hardy, it prefers a sunny position and loamy soil; pruning should immediately follow flowering. Like most buddlejas, the species is easily propagated from cuttings. Hardiness: RHS H5, USDA zones 7 – 9.

B. alternifolia was accorded the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (record 674) in 1993.

Cultivars
 Buddleja alternifolia ‘Argentea’.

"Sarasota Reds

The Sarasota Reds were a professional minor league baseball team, located in Sarasota, Florida, as a member of the Florida State League. However team originally started play in Sarasota as the Sarasota White Sox in 1989. They remained in the city for the next 21 seasons, going through a series of name changes due to their affiliation changes. They were known as the White Sox from 1989–1993, as the Sarasota Red Sox from 1994–2004, and the Reds from 2004–2009. In Sarasota, the team played in Payne Park (1989) and then Ed Smith Stadium (1990–2009). They won two division championships, in 1989 and 1992, and made playoff appearances in 1989, 1991, 1992, 1994, and 2007.

However the roots of the Reds can be traced back, even further, to the Tampa Tarpons. In the 1980s rumors arose that a major league team would come to Tampa, which would threaten the viability of the Tarpons and other minor league teams in the Tampa Bay Area. In 1988 the Chicago White Sox replaced Cincinnati as the Tarpons' affiliate, launching murmurs that the White Sox would themselves relocate to the area. Fearing his team would soon be displaced, in 1989 Tarpons owner Mitchell Mick sold his franchise to the White Sox, who moved it to Sarasota, Florida as the Sarasota White Sox.

The team's Sarasota era produced many notable player who would go on to play in majors. Bo Jackson, Mike LaValliere, Dave Stieb, Hall of Famer Frank Thomas and Bob Wickman all played for the Sarasota White Sox. Meanwhile, Stan Belinda, David Eckstein, Nomar Garciaparra, Byung-hyun Kim, Jeff Suppan, Dustin Pedroia, Jonathan Papelbon, and Kevin Youkilis were alumni of the Sarasota Red Sox. The Sarasota Reds also produced many notable major league players such as Jay Bruce, Johnny Cueto, Joey Votto, Chris Heisey, and Drew Stubbs.

After the Reds' spring-training departure from Florida's Grapefruit League to Arizona's Cactus League in 2009, the Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates did an ""affiliate-swap"". The Pirates took over the Sarasota Reds, while the Reds became the parent club of the Pirates' former Class A-Advanced affiliate, the Lynchburg Hillcats of the Carolina League. The Pittsburgh Pirates have had their spring training facilities based in Bradenton, Florida since in 1969, when the city met with Pirates' general manager Joe Brown and owner John W. Galbreath and both sides agreed to a lease of 40 years, with an option for another 40 years. On November 10, 2009, baseball officials voted to allow the Pirates to purchase and uproot the Sarasota Reds. The Pirates moved the team to Bradenton, where they were renamed the Bradenton Marauders. The Marauders became the first Florida State League team located in Bradenton since the Bradenton Growers folded in 1926.

Logos and uniforms
The Sarasota teams' names, logos and team colors were all closely associated with each's parent club. For example, the logos for Sarasota White Sox, Red Sox and Reds were just slightly altered versions of the parent club logos. However, there were attempts to allow some of these teams to find their own unique identities. In 2000, the Sarasota Red Sox introduced their mascot Gordy the Gecko. The Red Sox front office felt that since the team was based in Florida, its mascot should be reflective to the area. Soon Gordy found his way on to the team's caps as an alternate logo.

The magazine was named after José Sixto Álvarez (1858–1903), writer and journalist who was notable for his humorous texts, apart of having been the founder of Caras y Caretas. Fray Mocho published 196 issues until its closure in 1929.

History
The magazine was founded with the purpose of continuing the editorial line of Caras y Caretas that had significantly changed since the death of Sixto Alvarez in 1903. Some of Fray Mocho founders and main collaborators were Carlos Correa Luna, Spanish illustrator José María Cao, writer Luis Pardo (under the seudonym ""Luis García""), Félix Lima, painter Juan Peláez, Czech cartoonist José Friedriech,La Revista Fray Mocho y un tango dedicado by León Benarós on Todo Tango website and artist Juan Hohmann.Fray Mocho was an alternative to general-interest magazines such as Caras y Caretas or PBT, with an average of 80,000 copies printed. In 1922 the magazine added more articles about classical culture and art, ceasing the use of illustrations on its covers and adding more photographs and paintings until 1929 when it ceased to be published.

The magazine covered a wide range of topics, some of its permanent sections were theatre activities, provinces, women, Montevideo, readers' letters, children's literature, horse racing, other countries' traditions and costumes, and everyday life, among others.

Visual styleFray Mocho's visual aesthetic had influences of the romanticism and art nouveau styles at its first steps, then changing to art deco.

The rise of art nouveau in Argentina in the 1900s influenced not only magazines' visual styles but facades of private houses, and was quickly adopted by the middle class. That aesthetic renovation was also visible on typography, illustration and design of Fray Mocho, as well as advertisement, facades of public buildings and even clothing in the Argentine society of that age.

"St Andrew's Church, Redbourne

St Andrew's Church is a redundant Anglican church in the village of Redbourne, Lincolnshire, England.  It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.  The church stands in the centre of the village, which is to the east of the A15 road, and some  south of Brigg.

History

The church dates from the 14th–15th century.  Rebuilding took place in the later part of the 18th century; this included new north and south chapels in the 1770s by William and Thomas Lumby of Lincoln.  The plaster ceilings date from 1775–77, and the top two stages were added to the tower in 1785.  A new west door, partial rebuilding of the aisles, the chancel, and the clerestory, probably also date from this period.  The south chapel was rebuilt in early 19th century as a mausoleum for the Dukes of St Albans.  The church was restored in 1888 by the local architect W. W. Goodhand.  The restorations included removing the gallery, reordering the seating, and the addition of a new south porch.  The church was declared redundant in May 1978.  A vestry door was inserted and east side windows were removed in about 1985.

Architecture

Exterior
St Andrew's is constructed in limestone with some rendering.  The nave, aisles and clerestory have lead roofs; the mausoleum, vestry and porch are slated.  Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south porch, a single-bay chancel with a vestry and organ chamber to the north, and the mausoleum to the south, and a west tower.  The tower has a rectangular staircase projection to the southeast.  It is in four stages, divided by string courses, on a moulded plinth.  In the bottom stage on the west side is a blocked doorway, an arched three-light window, and a square-headed two-light window.  On the north and south sides are lighting slits.  In the staircase turret are three slits, and a sundial.  The second stage contains two-light windows, and in the third stage is a clock face on the west side.  In the top stage are two-light bell openings, and the parapet is embattled.  The aisles have pointed two-light windows and along the clerestory are square-headed two-light windows.  In the south aisle there is a blocked doorway to the west, a blocked lancet window to the east, blocked circular windows to the east and west, and a blocked pointed south window.  A carved stone dating from the 10th–11th century has been re-set in the west wall.  The chancel has an east window.  In the vestry are two two-light windows, and the mausoleum has a south door.  All the parapets are embattled, some with crocketted pinnacles.

Interior
The arcades are carried on octagonal piers.  The ceilings are plastered, the nave ceiling being decorated with foliate bosses.  The floors are flagged.  The baluster-shaped font was made in 1775 by Richard Hayward.  The east window contains painted glass by William Collins dating from about 1840.  This is a copy of The Opening of the Sixth Seal (part of the Last Judgment) by Francis Danby.  Also by Collins are twelve stained glass windows depicting the Apostles.  The organ is no longer present.  There is a ring of six bells.  Five of these were cast in 1774 by Henry Harrison II, and the undated sixth bell is by James Harrison III.

Memorials

In the north wall of the chancel is a niche containing a black marble graveslab depicting a knight and angels, and is dated 1410.  On the south side of the chancel are marble wall tablets to members of the Carter family with dates in the 18th century, and to the 8th Duke of St Albans, who died in 1825, and his wife.  On the north side of the chancel is a memorial to the 9th Duke of St Albans who died in 1851 by J. G. Lough, and to his wife, Harriet, who died in 1837, by Chantrey, and a memorial to Charlotte, Lady Beauclerk, dating from about 1825.  In the mausoleum are two tiers of tombs of the St Albans family.

External features
In the churchyard is a gravestone dated 1737 to Rev Josias Morgan, vicar of the parish,  It is listed at Grade II.  There are also the war graves of a soldier of World War I, and another of World War II.

"Waßmannsdorf

Waßmannsdorf is a village and a civil parish (Ortsteil) of the German town of Schönefeld, located in the district of Dahme-Spreewald in Brandenburg. As of 2007 its population was of around 1,000.

History
First mentioned in 1350 as Wasmanstorp, the village was an autonomous municipality until 2003, when it merged into Schönefeld. From 1961 to 1989 its municipal borders with West Berlin were crossed by the Berlin Wall.

Geography
Waßmannsdorf is located in the southeastern suburb of Berlin, near the districts of Tempelhof-Schöneberg, Neukölln and Treptow-Köpenick; and bordering with the quarter of Rudow. The nearest places are Großziethen, Selchow, Schönefeld and Blankenfelde-Mahlow. The village is 20 km far from Königs Wusterhausen, 28 from Ludwigsfelde and 34 from Potsdam.

Transport

Waßmannsdorf is situated close to the runway of Berlin Schönefeld Airport, that will be merged into the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport in 2017. Crossed by the Berlin outer ring, it will be served by a new railway station on the S-Bahn extension to the new airport (lines S45 and S9). The village is also interested by the Expressway Potsdam-Schönefeld projects.

"Starch analysis

Starch analysis or starch grain analysis is a technique that is useful in archaeological research to determine plant taxa. In certain samples of food plants, spices, drugs and desiccated archaeological plant matter, the histological elements can survive and thus be identified but in other samples, like carbonized (burnt) or older materials this is extremely difficult. However starch grains are much more hardy. The technique relies on the fact that a researcher can analyze or microscopically observe starch grains found on artifacts or in soils. Starch grains, ubiquitous in plants, have individual characteristics and resistance to grinding and drying and even to light burning so they are often preserved when other plant remains are lost - thus providing an additional tool to understand the past use of plants.

Usefulness
Starch grain analysis is not a perfect science, however, plant starch grain analysis is a diagnostic feature of multiple applications according to the peculiarities and to the origin of the plant material.
The size, shape and structure of grains from plant species, varies little, which can lead to identification. Starch grains have been removed and identified from stone tools, ceramic sherds, organic materials, dental calculus, and sediments and animal remains to determine diet and when humans began to exploit wild food varieties.

Disadvantages
In some cases the grains can become degraded. Factors such as heat and water absorption may affect the structure of the grains, making  identification more difficult. Even if the  remains are well preserved, water logging, dehydration, desiccation or damage from  fungi can destroy the starch. In some cases, even within the same species, starch grains can differ in shape and size and the size of the grain affects its survivability in the archaeological record.

Biology of starch 

Starch is produced in plants as a form of energy storage through the process of photosynthesis. When the plant is in need of energy, the stored starch is converted back into glucose.

Starch grain identification 
There are two basic methods for identifying starch: 
 Diagnostic tests of chemical and physical properties
 Optical properties of the granules.

Starch grains are typically microscopically identified with either optical or electron microscopy. Starch grains can become clearer if they are stained a darker color with Iodine Stains. Logol's Iodine is one, used for staining starch because iodine reagents easily bind to starch but less easily to other materials. Features that allow identification of starch grains include:  presence of hilum (core of the grain), lamellae (or growth layers), birefringence, and extinction cross (a cross shape, visible on grains under revolving polarized light) which are visible with a microscope and shape and size.

Low magnification
Archaeological research focused on residue adhering to artifacts start at lower magnifications, commonly using a stereoscope. Most data obtained at this stage is qualitative, an important first stage to fuller analysis. Magnifications of between x10 and x50 are sufficient to locate target residues, describe features and confirm internal structures of the identified residues.

High magnification
Modern light, high powered microscopes have an internal light source, allowing illumination with both transmitted and reflected light. These microscopes can provide a magnification of up to x1000: good enough to provide clear images of starch granules as small as a few micrometres in diameter.

Starch granules show different sizes. For example;
 Tapioca starch: 5-35 µm
 Potato starch: 15-100 µm
 Maize starch: 5-25 µm
 Rice starch: 3-8 µm
but all are generally under 100 micrometres in size, and are, therefore, best observed under compound microscopes equipped with various lighting conditions and magnifications from x200 to x800.

The starch grains are also compared to standard reference collections for comparison. 
Archaeologists and researchers can consider four issues in classification of the plant(s) and its use(s): 
 Determination of whether evidence for the utilization of plants is present
 Study of the assemblage variation
 Determination of the presence of particular plant species
 Assign percentages of starch granules within a sample to a particular taxon, and present quantitative data regarding relative abundance within the sample. Identification of ancient starch is fairly easily for the first three levels of classification, whilst the fourth level requires continued improvement in the description, classification, and identification of individual starch granules.

Starch in sediments 
Starch granules retrieved from sediments are used to reconstruct the habitats associated with human land use. Such studies address two areas of interest to the archaeologist:
 landscapes; specifically the reconstruction of historical plant communities at the widest scale of the environment
 specific contexts, such as settlements or activity areas; focusing on individual archaeological sites, or separate contexts within them, with the goal of identify specific human activities at a particular location.
The stages involved in the analysis of starch from sediments are; sampling, extraction of starch, slide mounting and viewing, and interpretation.

Sampling
Sampling a sediment core or stratigraphic profile to gather information about an environment requires a detailed understanding of the way the sediments were formed.

Extraction
Most extraction techniques follow a general methodology of: 
 sample preparation (sieving, drying, or soaking)
 disaggregation and deflocculation to break up the elements of the sample into single particles
 removal of undesired particles (sands, silts, minerals, organics).
 chemicals preservation of the starch granules.

Slide mounting and viewing
Starch granules are mounted onto a slide, using a variety of mounting medias including, but not limited, to water, glycerol, and glycerine jelly. It is important that the material is dried thoroughly before being mounted to ensure that no further degradation of the sample occurs. 
The slide is then viewed, as appropriate, for identification and counting.

Interpretation
After the starch granules have been examined, the findings are then recorded and interpreted with respect to the research questions that are being investigated.

Starch on artifacts 
Artifacts collect starch granules and protect them from decay due to microorganisms, thus providing excellent conditions for long-term preservation. The analysis may focus on the function of the tool, to examine a broader range of human behaviour but starch analysis also allows insights into craft activities involving the preparation of adhesives, medicines, or other nonfood items.

Modified starch 
Starch can also be investigated when it is not in its raw form. For example, Modified starch is created when the morphological or physico-chemical structure of native starch is disrupted in some way, such as in food preparation. The most common way to modify starch is to apply heat. Cooking pits, hearths, and ovens that may have come into contact with starchy material yield  modified starches which can provide other insights.

Modified starch is only likely to be preserved under specific conditions, such as arid regions because of its susceptibility to organic decay. Studies of ancient modified starch aid understanding of ancient food technology, variations in cuisine among different social groups, as well as provide an understanding the function of ancient food-processing equipment.

Preserved forms of modified starch include:
 Discrete desiccated macroremains: coherent foods that are not attached to any other object and are among the most easily recognizable ancient starchy prepared foodstuffs. They can be either the intended final prepared food, like loaves of bread, or intermediate products of the food processing sequence, like starch-rich, chaffy lumps.
 Attached desiccated residues: collections of starchy foodstuffs adhered to a container or vessel. The ability to identify these residues is affected by the quantity and appearance of the residue, as well as the awareness of the excavators. Residues containing obvious plant tissue are most easily recognizable, while thin smears are not as easy to recognize.
 Charred residues: normally the result of accidental overcooking and can be preserved as discrete fragments or remain stuck to the cooking vessel. Due to their charred nature, these residues are very difficult to identify.

"The Dark at the Top of the Stairs (film)

The Dark at the Top of the Stairs is a 1960 American drama film. Academy Award winner Delbert Mann directed the work of Robert Preston and Dorothy McGuire in the production. Shirley Knight garnered an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, and Lee Kinsolving was nominated for a Golden Globe Award as Best Supporting Actor. Knight was also nominated for two Golden Globes. Mann's direction was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing in a Feature Film. It was based on the Tony Award-nominated play of the same name by William Inge.

Plot
During Prohibition in Oklahoma, Rubin Flood is a successful harness and saddle salesman. However, with the advent of the automobile, his job is becoming more difficult. He is married to Cora, someone he considers a demanding wife and over-protective mother. When he learns his company is closing, he is unable to face his wife, and stops at a pharmacy to partake of ""medicinal"" alcohol. Cora is out with her daughter Reenie, buying a dress for a birthday party of one of her classmates.

Rubin cannot bring himself to tell Cora he has lost his job, arguing about how much Cora has spent on Reenie's dress, with Cora's lamenting that she always has to watch every penny. The couple's younger son Sonny is being bullied at school. Sonny has a fear of the dark. Determined to get him to stand up for himself, Rubin attempts to teach him to box. While sparring, he inadvertently strikes the boy too hard. Cora, now incensed, tears into Rubin, eventually accusing him of having an affair with Mavis Pruitt, a local widow. A livid Rubin slaps Cora, then storms out of the house. Reenie witnesses her parents' dispute. She runs into the street, causing a motorist to swerve and strike a tree. The driver, Sammy Golden, is relatively unhurt, and he and Reenie become attracted to one another.

Cora calls her older sister Lottie to tell her that Rubin hit her. Rubin, still slightly intoxicated, shows up at Mavis' beauty salon, which also is where she lives. He is seen going in by two town gossips. Rubin tells her Cora has ignored him for years, and while he has remained faithful, he desires Mavis. When she doesn't accept his halfhearted advances, Rubin falls asleep on her parlor sofa.

Days later, Lottie and her husband are there for dinner. Cora asks Lottie if she and the kids can come stay with her. Just as she asks, Rubin returns home to apologize. The two gossips call Cora to tell her, which re-ignites the argument. He accuses Cora of rejecting him sexually, and she argues that she can't be in the mood when she spends her days worrying about money. Reenie's friend Flirt and her boyfriend arrive, with a date for Reenie, Sammy. Lottie's bigotry is revealed when she suggests that Cora and Rubin might not want to allow Reenie to accompany a Jew to the party.

Sammy and Reenie kiss at the party, but Harry Ralston and his wife walk in on them, berating her for bringing a Jew to the country club, where they are not allowed. Embarrassed, Sammy and Reenie leave. Sammy bemoans the bigotry in the world, and drops Reenie at home, where she finds Rubin on the sofa. He confesses that he has lost his job and doesn't know how to tell Cora. The following morning, they learn Sammy has attempted suicide. Reenie rushes to the hospital, telling him that she doesn't care what people think. 

Cora promises Sonny to stop being so over-protective so he can grow into a responsible adult, then receives a call letting her know that Sammy has died. Cora heads over to Mavis's salon. She pretends to be a customer, before revealing she is Rubin's wife. Mavis confesses that she has been in love with Rubin for years, but that Rubin has always been faithful to Cora. She also reveals that Rubin has lost his job.

Rubin has found a new job as a salesman at an oil drilling equipment company. He returns home to find Cora waiting for him. She has sent Reenie to Lottie's for a few days to help her come to grips with Sammy's death. Cora and Rubin declare their love for one another and a commitment to paying more attention to each other's needs. As they embrace, Sonny returns home with a friend, one of his former tormentors from school. Rubin pays for the two boys to go see a movie, After they leave, he follows his wife up to the bedroom.

Production
Warner Brothers announced in January 1960 that it would be producing a film version of Inge's play, directed by Delbert Mann, and starring Robert Preston and Dorothy McGuire. During rehearsals for the production, Mann used the same process he had used since his first film, Marty, in 1955. First, the cast read through the entire script, then they rehearsed the entire screenplay on set prior to the commencement of filming. The film went into production in late January. By the beginning of March an actor's strike was looming, scheduled for March 7. Warner Brothers began going to seven days a week production schedules, in order to complete filming before the strike. In mid-July, it was announced that The Dark at the Top of the Stairs would headline the launch of the fall season, opening at Radio City Music Hall after Labor Day. The film opened on September 22, 1960 at Radio City Music Hall in New York.

Reception
Variety gave the film a favorable review, noting that it was ""well cast and persuasively acted"". However, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times did not give the film a favorable review, calling it a ""flawed adaptation of the original stage play"". The Film Bulletin gave the film a good review, if they did find it uneven, calling it a ""rather absorbing drama, with goodly shares of humor, warmth, and tragedy"". They felt that Preston's performance was fine, but would have been better if he had brought more ""humility and tenderness"" to the role. They found McGuire's performance ""splendid"", and thought Mann's direction was professional, but that he focused on ""certain scenes singularly, rather than integrating them into the whole"". Motion Picture Daily gave the film another good review, although they were not kind to Mann's direction, finding it to be the weakness in the picture, saying that he ""failed to draw out some of the most vital scenes all the urgency and pathos that Inge had wrote into them"". They praised the work of Harriett Frank and Irving Ravetch in their adaptation of Inge's play to the screen, and felt the acting was exceptional. They called Preston's work ""excellent"", and McGuire ""warm and appealing""; they felt the rest of the cast was well-done, and singled out Lansbury's performance as outstanding. The one sour note in the acting corps, the felt, was Arden's performance as the aunt, which they felt worked during the comedic sections, but was ""out of key"" during the dramatic moments.

Shirley Knight earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Reenie Flood. Knight also received two Golden Globe nominations for her performance: for Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture and New Star Of The Year - Actress. Lee Kinsolving also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role as ""Sammy Goldenbaum"". Mann's direction was nominated for a Directors Guild of America Award for ""outstanding directorial achievement"". The film was voted one of the ten best of the year in 1960 by the National Board of Review. Eve Arden's performance rated among the five best of the year by supporting actresses, according to The Film Daily's poll of over 1800 critics.

"New Tales of Gisaeng

New Tales of Gisaeng (; also known as New Gisaeng Story) is a 2011 South Korean television series starring Im Soo-hyang, Sung Hoon and Han Hye-rin. Written by Im Sung-han and directed by Son Moon-kwon, it aired on SBS from January 23 to July 17, 2011 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:45 for 52 episodes.

Plot
""Gisaeng"" was the Korean equivalent of a geisha or courtesan knowledgeable in poetry, dance, music, culture and politics, who entertained noblemen and royalty of the Joseon Dynasty. This series explores the premise that gisaeng still existed in modern-day Korea.

Dan Sa-ran (Im Soo-hyang) lost her mother at a young age, and never quite got along with her stepmother and stepsister. Despite her humble background, she carries herself with pride and grace, majoring in classical dance during college. Drawing the attention of Buyonggak's head gisaeng with her dancing talent and classic beauty, Sa-ran enters Korea's sole traditional gisaeng house, an exclusive establishment that serves only VIP guests. Ah Da-mo (Sung Hoon) is a cocky second-generation chaebol with his own set of daddy issues. He can't be bothered to give any woman the time of day... until he meets Sa-ran.

"Lorenzo Parodi

Lorenzo Parodi (Genoa, 24 May 1926 – Genoa, 31 July 2011) was an Italian trade unionist, communist revolutionary and politician, founder in 1965 of Lotta Comunista with Arrigo Cervetto.

From the small workshop to Ansaldo 
Lorenzo Parodi was born into a working-class family: his father ""Bartolomeo Parodi"" worked at the forging department ""Ansaldo"" of Genoa Sampierdarena. He started to work at fourteen years old in a small bolts of Genova Nervi, in the midst of World War II Lorenzo goes to the big factory, and the professional apprenticeship come before the first political experiences just over a year.
Lorenzo Parodi starts to work at Ansaldo, as a turner at the department ""small cars"" (MAPI) in the summer of 1942. Half a century later, introducing the third edition of ""Cronache Operaie"", he remembers "" We were among the boys entered the factories in the early forties to replace the ""cannon fodder"" sent to front .""

The first political experiences in the fire of World War 
In the spring of 1943 Lorenzo Parodi joined the strike in progress at Ansaldo and in 1944, to escape the Nazi raids and deportation, he's forced to leave the factory. Parodi becomes partisan in SAP Brigade ""Crosa"" of Genova Nervi: here his political novitiate starts; due his anti-Stalinist choice, he meets the young libertarian communists of Nervi like Antonio Pittaluga, Vero Grassini, Agostino Sessarego and Mario Vignale and later the group of Genoa Sestri.

It is especially ""the refusal of Togliatti's opportunism"" and the attempt ""still confused to salvage the savable from the opportunistic wave that will block and overwhelm the class movement emerged from the struggle against fascism"" the factors that will approaches him and his group to libertarian and anarchist ideas.

The process of political maturation in the postwar 
The young Parodi return to Ansaldo at the end of the war. His political work is expressed in the commitment to bring the anarchist movement on a line of concrete political struggle; with Arrigo Cervetto and other people like them, he works for the foundation of the ""Anarchist Groups of Proletarian Action"" (GAAP), enshrined in the Convention of Genoa Pontedecimo of February 1951. ""It is the search for  another communism  that was not the subjection to Moscow of stalinian PCI that will connect Lorenzo Parodi and Arrigo Cervetto between 1948 and 1949. The meeting land was an attempt of Pier Carlo Masini and Cervetto to group around the young of the FAI Italian Anarchist Federation in a libertarian communist movement, organized and federated, to leave the traditional anarchist individualism.

The research for  'homogeneity as theoretical science of revolution'  directs him to a serious study of ""Capital"" in Marx and to study Lenin.

The Internationalist position on the uprising in Budapest 
The presence in the National Steering Committee of the CGIL provides the grandstand for a clear internationalist position on the workers' revolt in Budapest of October and November 1956.
The Secretary-General Di Vittorio, after his deploring on Russia's military intervention expressed on October, made a rapid march back. Lorenzo Parodi supports the uprising in Budapest in connection with other significant events of that crucial 1956 (the Revolt of Poznan, the colonial war conducted in Algeria by the government of Guy Mollet, the Suez Crisis).

The confluence in Azione Comunista 
After the confluence of the GAAP, in the spring 1957, in the group of ""Azione Comunista"" founded two years earlier by a ""dissident"" of PCI, Parodi is committed to the side of Arrigo Cervetto against the Maximalism of the group to attest an internationalist position. He presents with Cervetto, at the first conference of the Communist Left November 1957 in Livorno, the ""Theses on imperialist development, the duration of the counter and on the development of the class party"", that is now expressed in an organic strategic vision of the current Leninist.

The Foundation of Lotta Comunista 
The strategic task for the proletariat, the class that can and should revolutionize the imperialist society, is now clearly outlined in the vision that Parodi shares with Cervetto's vision. The strategic vision of the Theses of '57 is in fact linked to the conception of the party's strategy: to Parodi Cervetto send in 1964 the drafts of the study (which will be collected two years later in volume, with the title of ""Class Struggles and revolutionary party "", and over again until the sixth edition of 2004, which also republishes those letters) on the Leninist concept of political action, with the goal of having  'a text-based current Leninist in Italy"".
On that basis Cervetto and Parodi can turn the page on the experience of ""Azione Comunista"" in December 1965, year of the first issue of ""Lotta Comunista"" (which will Parodi director until his death) and begins a vast work of settlement organization.

"James Loney (peace activist)

James Loney (born 1964) is a Canadian peace activist who has worked for several years with Christian Peacemaker Teams in Iraq and Palestine. On November 26, 2005, he was kidnapped in Baghdad along with three others: Harmeet Singh Sooden (Canadian) and Norman Kember (British), both members of the delegation he was leading; and Tom Fox (American), a full-time member of CPT who had been working in Iraq since September 2004. The widely publicized hostage crisis (see  2005-2006 Christian Peacemaker hostage crisis) ended on March 23, 2006 when Loney, Kember and Sooden were freed in a clandestine military operation led by British Special Forces. Tom Fox was killed on March 9, two weeks before the release of the other hostages.

While Loney was held as a hostage, his family and partner Dan Hunt withheld the fact of his homosexuality out of fear for his safety.  The media was aware of this fact but cooperated in keeping it secret.

He made a brief media appearance on March 30: ""I'll take things slowly until I can get through a day without shaking legs and a pounding heart,"" he said.

Early life 
Loney was born in Calgary, Alberta, and was raised in Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.  During his late teens he worked as a counsellor at Columbus Boys' Camp near Orillia, Ontario, on Lake Simcoe. This was a summer camp for underprivileged boys, funded by the Knights of Columbus and staffed by senior high school students from various schools run by the Basilian Fathers until 2002, when it was sold to Stu Saunders, who turned it into a leadership camp.

Loney was a founding member Zacchaeus House, one of several houses that were part of the Toronto Catholic Worker. From 1990 to 2001 he was a member of the Zacchaeus House community—a house of hospitality which welcomes people in need of housing. While no longer an active part of the community, Zacchaues House continues to function today.

After release
In June 2006, Loney entered headlines again for joining in the protest against the controversial use of security certificates to detain foreign residents in Canada for years without charges or trial.

On June 20, 2006, Loney and several other staff members of the Ontario Catholic Youth Leadership Camp held a press conference in Toronto in which they claimed the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic charitable organization, shut down the camp after learning about Loney's sexual orientation upon his return from captivity. The Ontario Knights of Columbus denied this was the reason for closing the camp. The camp re-opened the following summer under the same name but with a new director and staff.
On that same day, Loney and his partner Hunt were honoured at the Toronto 2006 Pride Day Gala with the Fearless Award.

According to a November 11, 2006 report in the Guelph Mercury of a speech he'd given to university students on November 9, Loney refused to wear a poppy on Remembrance Day. Loney claimed that it ""says we have to be ready for the next time - vigilance.""

Canadian singer-songwriter, Jon Brooks, wrote two songs on Loney's CD Ours And The Shepherds in response to the controversy. Jim Loney's Prayer Part I and Jim Loney's Prayer Part II were chosen as bookends to the track-list on a CD about Canadian war stories.

On December 8, 2006, Loney, Kember and Sooden publicly forgave their captors at a press conference held at St. Ethelburga's Peace Center, London, England. On this same day a year before their kidnappers had threatened to execute them. In their joint statement of forgiveness they said, ""We unconditionally forgive our captors for abducting and holding us. We have no desire to punish them,"" and ""Should those who have been charged with holding us hostage be brought to trial and convicted, we ask that they be granted all possible leniency. We categorically lay aside any rights we may have over them."" 

On May 23, 2007, Loney released a public statement saying that he would not be testifying against his captors who are now in U.S. custody citing the lack of transparency in Iraqi courts, the limited access to lawyers and the death penalty.I recently informed the RCMP that I will not testify. I cannot participate in a judicial process where the prospects of a fair trial are negligible, and more crucially, where the death penalty is a possibility.

Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden were among 250 Canadians who risked charges under Canada's anti-terrorism legislation in the spring of 2009 for contributing towards a plane ticket for Abousfian Abdelrazik, a Canadian man who was detained by the Sudanese government at Canada’s request, tortured, imprisoned for two years without charge and then denied travel documents to return to Canada. The ticket Loney helped purchase exposed how the government was actively blocking his return and led to the June 2009 court ruling which forced the Canadian government to bring him home. Loney was one of 30 supporters who were on hand to welcome Abdelrazik home upon his arrival at Toronto's Pearson International Airport on June 27, 2009.

"History of Schleswig-Holstein

The history of Schleswig-Holstein consists of the corpus of facts since the pre-history times until the modern establishing of the Schleswig-Holstein state.

Early history

The Jutland Peninsula is a peninsula in Northern Europe with modern-day Schleswig-Holstein at its base. Schleswig is also called Southern Jutland (Sønderjylland). The old Scandinavian sagas, perhaps dating back to the times of the Angles and Jutes give the impression that Jutland has been divided into a northern and a southern part with the border running along the Kongeå River.

Taking into account both archeological findings and Roman sources, however, one could conclude that the Jutes inhabited both the Kongeå region and the more northern part of the peninsula, while the Angles lived approximately where the towns Haithabu and Schleswig later would emerge (originally centered in the southeast of Schleswig in Angeln), the Saxons (earlier known apparently as the Reudingi) originally centered in Western Holstein (known historically as ""Northalbingia"") and Slavic Wagrians, part of the Obodrites (Abodrites) in Eastern Holstein. The Danes settled in the early Viking ages in Northern and Central Schleswig and the Northern Frisians after approximately the year 900 in Western Schleswig.

The pattern of populated and unpopulated areas was relatively constant through Bronze Age and Iron Age.

After the Dark Ages migrations

After many Angles emigrated to the British Islands in the 5th century, the land of the Angles came in closer contact with the Danish islands — plausibly by partly immigration/occupation by the Danes. Later also the contacts increased between the Danes and the people on the northern half of the Jutish peninsula.

Judging by today's placenames, then the southern linguistic border of the Danish language seems to have been (starting at the west) up the Treene river, along the Danevirke (also known as Danewerk), then cutting across from the Schlei estuary to Eckernförde, and leaving the Schwansen peninsula, while the West coast of Schleswig had been the area of the Frisian language.

After the Slavic migrations, the eastern area of modern Holstein was inhabited by Slavic Wagrians (Vagri) a subgroup of the Obotrites (Obotritae).

Nordalbingia and Wagria in 8th century-9th century

Apart from northern Holstein and Schleswig inhabited by Danes there were Nordalbingia and Wagria in respectively, Western and Eastern Holstein.

Nordalbingia (German: Nordalbingien, i.e. land north of the Elbe river) was one of the four administrative regions of the medieval Duchy of Saxony, the others being Angria, Eastphalia, and Westphalia. Nordalbingia consisted of four districts: Dithmarschen, Holstein, Stormarn (north of the Elbe) and Hadeln (south of the Elbe).

The Wagri, Wagiri, or Wagrians were a tribe of Polabian Slavs inhabiting Wagria, or eastern Holstein in northern Germany, from the ninth to twelfth centuries. They were a constituent tribe of the Obodrite confederacy.

Conquest of Nordalbingia by Obodrites and Franks
In the Battle of Bornhöved (798) (German: Schlacht bei Bornhöved) on the field of Sventanafeld (Sventanapolje, Slavonic for ""sacred field"") near the village of Bornhöved near Neumünster in 798 the Obodrites, led by Drożko, allied with the Franks, defeated the Nordalbingian Saxons.

Following defeat of Norgalbingians in the Battle of Bornhöved by combined forces of the Obodrites and the Franks, where the Saxons lost 4,000 people, 10,000 Saxon families were deported to other areas of the empire. Areas north of Elbe (Wagria) were given to the Obodrites, while Hadeln was directly incorporated. However, the Obodrites soon were invaded by Danes and only the intervention of Charlemagne pushed the Danes out of Eider river.

Danish, Saxon, Franks struggle for control of Holstein

As Charlemagne extended his realm in the late 8th century, he met a united Danish army which successfully defended Danevirke, a fortified defensive barrier across the south of the territory west of the Schlei. A border was established at the Eider River in 811.

This strength was enabled by three factors: 
 the fishing,
 the good soil giving good pasture and harvests
 in particular the tax and customs revenues from the market in Haithabu, where all trade between the Baltic Sea and Western Europe passed.

The Danevirke was built immediately south of the road where boats or goods had to be hauled for approximately 5 kilometers between a Baltic Sea bay and the small river Rheider Au (Danish, Rejde Å) connected to the North Sea. There on the narrowest part of southern Jutland was established the important transit market (Haithabu, also known as Hedeby, near modern Haddeby), which was protected by the Danevirke fortification. Hedeby was located on the inlet Schlei opposite to what is now the City of Schleswig.

The wealth of Schleswig, as reflected by impressive archeological finds on the site today, and the taxes from the Haithabu market, was enticing. A separate kingdom of Haithabu was established around year 900 by the Viking chieftain Olaf from Svealand. Olaf's son and successor Gnupa was however killed in battle against the Danish king, and his kingdom vanished.

The southern border was then adjusted back and forth a few times. For instance, the Holy Roman Emperor Otto II occupied the region between the river Eider and the inlet Schlei in the years 974–983, called the March of Schleswig, and stimulating German colonisation. Later Haithabu was burned by Swedes, and first under the reign of King Sweyn Forkbeard (Svend Tveskæg) (986-1014) the situation was stabilised, although raids against Haithabu would be repeated. Haithabu was once again and ultimately destroyed by fire in 1066. As Adam of Bremen reported in 1076, the Eider River was the border between Denmark and the Saxon territories.

From the time Danes came to Schleswig from today’s eastern part of Denmark and Germans colonised Schleswig migrating from Holstein, the country north of the Elbe had been the battleground of Danes and Germans, as well as certain Slavic people. Danish scholars point to the existence of Danish placenames north for Eider and Danevirke as evidence that at least the most of Schleswig was at one time Danish; German scholars claim it, on the other hand, as essentially ""Germanic"", due to the fact that Schleswig became an autonomous entity and a duchy  (in the 13th century) since it has been populated and been dominated from the South. The Duchy of Schleswig, or Southern Jutland (Sønderjylland), had been a Danish fief, though having been more or less independent from the Kingdom of Denmark during the centuries, similarly to Holstein, that had been from the first a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, originating in the small area of Nordalbingia, in today western Holstein, inhabited then mostly by Saxons, but in 13th century expanded to the present Holstein, after winning local Danish overlord. Throughout the Middle Ages, Schleswig was a source of rivalry between Denmark and the nobility of the duchy of Holstein within the Holy Roman Empire. The Danish position can be exemplified with an inscription on a stone in the walls of the town of Rendsburg (Danish: Rendsborg) located on the border between Schleswig and Holstein: Eidora Terminus Imperii Romani (""The River Eider is the Border of the Holy Roman Empire""). A number of Holsatian nobles sought to challenge this.

Danish, Saxon, Angles struggle for control of Schleswig

The area of Schleswig (Southern Jutland) was first inhabited by the mingled West Germanic tribes Cimbri, Angles and Jutes, later also by the North Germanic Danes and West Germanic Frisians. Holstein was inhabited mainly by the West Germanic Saxons, aside Wends (such as Obotrites) and other Slavic peoples in the East. The Saxons were the last of their nation to submit to Charlemagne (804), who put their country under Frankish counts, the limits of the Empire being pushed in 810 as far as the Schlei in Schleswig. In 811 the river Eider was declared as borderline between the Frankish Empire and Denmark. Then began the secular struggle between the Danish kings and the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, and in 934 the German king Henry I established the March of Schleswig (Limes Danarum) between the Eider and the Schlei as an outpost of the Empire against the Danes.

South of this raged the contest between the Empire and Slavs. The Slavs, conquered and Christianised, rose in revolt in 983, after the death of the emperor Otto II, and for a while reverted to paganism and independence. The Saxon dukes, however, continued to rule central Holstein, and when Lothair of Supplinburg became duke of Saxony (1106), on the extinction of the Billung line, he enfeoffed Lord Adolphus of Schauenburg with the County of Holstein, as a Saxon subfief, becoming Adolphus I, Count of Holstein with the Saxon, later Lower Saxon dukes as liege lords.

12th century

The Earl (jarl) Knud Lavard (Eng. Canute Lavard)(killed 1131), son of a Danish king, became Duke of Jutland or Southern Jutland. His son ascended the Danish throne, and the main branch continued as Kings, and a cadet branch descended from Abel of Denmark received Southern Jutland (Slesvig) as their appanage. During the rule of the dynasty Southern Jutland functioned as the Duchy which provided for the expenses of Royal Princes. Rivalry of royal succession and particularly the tendency of autonomy led to long-lasting feuds between the Dukes of Schleswig and the Kings of Denmark 1253–1325.

At that time, the Holy Roman Empire expanded northwards and had set up the Schauenburg family as counts of Holstein, under German suzerainty, first located in Nordalbingia, the Saxon part of the region, in what now is western Holstein. Knud Lavard had also gained awhile parts of Holstein, and thereby came in conflict with Count Adolphus I (Schauenburg) in the part of Holstein within the Empire, as they both were very keen on expanding their influence and pacifying the Wagrian tribe (see: Wends). Count Adolphus II, son of Adolphus I, succeeded and established the County of Holstein (1143) with about the borders it has had since then. Holstein was Christianised, many of the Wagrians were killed and the land was inhabited by settlers from Westphalia, Friesland and Holland. Soon the Holsatian towns, such as Lübeck and Hamburg, became serious trade competitors on the Baltic Sea.

13th century
Adolphus II (1128–1164), succeeded in re-conquering the Slavonic Wagri and founded the city and see of Lübeck to hold them in check. Adolphus III (d. 1225), his successor, received Dithmarschen in fee from the emperor Frederick I, but in 1203 the fortunes of war compelled him to surrender Holstein to Valdemar II of Denmark who mandated Albert of Orlamünde, the cession being confirmed in a Golden bull by the emperor Frederick II in 1214 and the pope in 1217, thus provoking the nobles in Holstein. Valdemar appointed his lieutenant in Holstein.

In 1223, King Valdemar and his eldest son were abducted by count Henry I, Count of Schwerin (also known as Heinrich der Schwarze), and held captive in Castle Dannenberg for several years. Count Henry demanded that Valdemar should surrender the land conquered in Holstein 20 years ago and become a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor who in fact tried to intervene and arrange the release of Valdemar. Danish envoys refused these terms and Denmark declared war. The war ended in defeat of the troops under the command of Albert of Orlamünde at Mölln in 1225, and Valdemar was forced to surrender his conquests as the price of his own release and take an oath not to seek revenge.

Valdemar was released from captivity in 1226 and appealed to Pope Honorius III to have his oath repealed, a request the Pope granted. In 1226, Valdemar attacked the nobles of Holstein, and initially, had success.

On July 22, 1227 the two armies clashed at Bornhöved in Holstein in the second Battle of Bornhöved. The battle ended in a decisive victory for Adolphus IV of Holstein. During the battle the troops from Dithmarschen abandoned the Danish army and joined Adolphus' army. In the following peace, Valdemar II relinquished his conquests in Holstein for good and Holstein was permanently secured to the house of Schauenburg.

King Valdemar II, who had retained the former imperial March north of the Eider, in 1232 erected Schleswig as a duchy for his second son, Abel. Holstein on the other hand, after the death of Adolphus IV in 1261, was split up into several countships by his sons and again by his grandsons (1290): the lines of Holstein-Kiel (1261–1390), Holstein-Pinneberg and Schaumburg (1290–1640) south of the Elbe, Holstein-Plön (1290–1350), Holstein-Rendsburg (1290–1459), and at times also Holstein-Itzehoe (1261–1290) and Holstein-Segeberg (1273–1315), and again 1397–1403), all named after the comital residential cities.

14th century
The connection between Schleswig and Holstein became closer during the 14th century as the ruling class and accompanying colonists intensely populated the Duchy Schleswig. Local lords of Schleswig had already early paid attention to keep Schleswig independent from the Kingdom of Denmark and to strengthen ties to Holstein within the Holy Roman Empire. This tradition of autonomy showed itself in future politics for centuries to come.

The rivalry, sometimes leading into war between the kings of Denmark and the Abelian dukes of Schleswig was expensive, and Denmark had to finance it through extensive loans. The Dukes of Schleswig were allied with the Counts of Holstein, who happened to become the main creditors of the Danish Crown, too, in the reign of the utterly incompetent king Christopher II of Denmark.

On the death of King Valdemar's descendant Eric VI of Denmark in 1319, Christopher II of Denmark attempted to seize the Duchy of Schleswig, the heir of which Duke Valdemar V (as of 1325) was a minor; but Valdemar's guardian and uncle, Gerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg (1304–1340), surnamed the Great and a notable warrior, drove back the Danes and, Christopher having been expelled, succeeded in procuring the election of Duke Valdemar to the Danish throne (as Valdemar III as of 1326), while Gerhard himself obtained the Duchy of Schleswig. King Valdemar III was regarded as a usurper by most Danish nobles as he had been forced by the Schleswig-Holstein nobility to sign the Constitutio Valdemaria (June 7, 1326) promising that The Duchy of Schleswig and the Kingdom of Denmark must never be united under the same ruler. Schleswig was consequently granted to Count Gerhard, being the leader of one of the three lines of the Schauenburg dynasty. The constitution can be seen as a first precursor to the Treaty of Ribe and similarly laying down the principle of separation between the Duchy of Schleswig and the Kingdom of Denmark and indeed uniting Schleswig and Holstein for the first time, though in personal union.

In 1330, Christopher II was restored to his throne and Valdemar III of Denmark abdicated his untenable kingship and returned to his former position as Duke of Schleswig which he held as Valdemar V of Schleswig. As compensation, Gerhard was awarded the island of Funen as a fief instead. In 1331 war broke out between Gerhard and King Christopher II, ending in Danish defeat. The peace terms were extremely harsh. King Christopher was only left in effective control of the small island of Langeland and faced the impossible task of raising 100,000 silver marks to redeem his country. Denmark had effectively been dissolved and was left without a king between 1332 and 1340. Gerhard, however, was assassinated in 1340 by a Dane.

In 1340, King Valdemar IV of Denmark began his more than twenty-year-long quest to reclaim his kingdom. While succeeding in regaining control of Zealand, Funen, Jutland, and Scania he, however, failed to obtain control of Schleswig, and its ducal line managed to continue its virtual independence.

This was the time when almost all of Denmark came under the supremacy of the Counts of Holstein, who possessed different parts of Denmark as pawns for their credits. King Valdemar IV (Atterdag) started to regain the kingdom part by part, and married his rival's sister Hedvig of Schleswig, the only daughter of Eric II, Duke of Schleswig. Duke Valdemar V of Slesvig's son, Henry, was in 1364 nominally entfeoffed with the Duchy, although he never reached to regain more than the northernmost parts as he couldn't raise the necessary funds to repay the loans. With him, the Abelian line became extinct. The true holder of the lands was the count of Holstein-Rendsburg, but Henry's feudal heirs were his first cousin Margaret of Denmark, queen of several Scandinavian realms, and Albert of Mecklenburg, son of Margaret's elder sister Ingeborg of Denmark.

In 1372, Valdemar Atterdag turned his attention to Schleswig and conquered Gram in 1372 and Flensburg in 1373. Southern parts of Schleswig had been mortgaged to several German nobles by Duke Henry I, Duke of Schleswig (d. 1375, a son of the former king Valdemar III of Denmark), the last duke of that line. The childless, elderly Henry transferred his rights to his kinsman and brother-in-law King Valdemar IV in 1373. The ethnically German nobles, however, refused to allow the king to repay the mortgage and redeem the area in question.

In 1374, Valdemar bought large tracts of land in the province and was on the verge of starting a campaign to conquer the rest when he died on October 24, 1374 and shortly hereon Duke Henry I died in 1375. It was then when the male lines both in the kingdom and the duchy became extinct, that the counts of Holstein-Rendsburg seized on Schleswig, assuming at the same time the style of lords of Jutland. The nobles quickly took action and managed to regain more control of the Duchy which they emphasised to be independent of the Danish Crown.

In 1386, Queen Margaret I of Denmark, younger daughter of Valdemar IV of Denmark and Helvig of Schleswig, granted Schleswig as a hereditary fief under the Danish crown to Count Gerhard VI of Holstein-Rendsburg, grandson of Gerhard III, provided that he swore allegiance to her son King Oluf, although Schleswig actually still was held autonomously by the Count of Holstein-Rendsburg. Gerhard - after the extinction of the lines of Holstein-Plön (1350) and Holstein-Kiel (1390) – finally obtained also Holstein-Segeberg in 1403, ruling thus all of Holstein except of Holstein-Pinneberg with the small Schauenburg territories in Lower Saxony. With this merging of power begins the history of the union of Schleswig and Holstein.

15th century
Gerhard VI died in 1404, and soon afterwards war broke out between his sons and Eric of Pomerania, Margaret's successor on the throne of Denmark, who claimed South Jutland as an integral part of the Danish monarchy, a claim formally recognised by the emperor Sigismund in 1424, it was not till 1440 that the struggle ended with the investiture of Count Adolphus VIII, Gerhard VI's son, with the hereditary duchy of Schleswig by Christopher III of Denmark.

In 1409, King Eric VII of Denmark (Eric of Pomerania) forced the German nobles to surrender Flensburg to him. War broke out in 1410, and Eric conquered Als and Ærø. In 1411, the nobles retook Flensburg, but in 1412 both sides agreed to a count of Mecklenburg to settle the dispute (Danish history claims his name was Ulrich of Mecklenburg). He awarded the city to Denmark, and Margaret I of Denmark took possession of the city. In Flensburg she was struck by the plague and died shortly after. A new mediation attempt was undertaken in 1416 by the Hanseatic League. Both sides accepted, and Denmark pledged the city of Schleswig as security, and the Holsteiners the stronghold of Tönning. The mediation was unsuccessful. In 1421, the Holsteiners succeeded in regaining Haderslev, Schleswig and Tønder.

In 1422, Duke Henry X of Silesia-Sagan (also known as duke Heinrich Rumpold), envoy of the Holy Roman Emperor, was recognised by both sides as arbitrator. He died, however, on January 18, 1423 before reaching a settlement. His master, Emperor Sigismund now wished to settle the issue, a decision strongly opposed by the nobles of Holstein. In 1424, Emperor Sigismund ruled, based on the fact that the people of Schleswig spoke Danish, followed Danish customs and considered themselves to be Danes, that the territory rightfully belonged to the King of Denmark. Henry IV, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, protested and refused to follow the verdict.

In 1425 war broke out again. In 1431, a group of pro-German burghers opened the gates of Flensburg and an army of German nobles marched in. In 1432 peace was settled, and Eric recognised the conquests made by the German nobles.

In 1439, the new Danish king Christopher III (also known as Christopher of Bavaria) bought the loyalty of count Adolphus VIII of Holstein-Rendsburg by granting him the entire Duchy of Schleswig as a hereditary fief but under the Danish crown. On the death of Christopher eight years later, Adolphus' influence secured the election of his nephew Count Christian VII of Oldenburg to the vacant Danish throne.

In 1448 Adolphus, as Adolphus I Duke of Slesvig and as Adolphus VIII Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, who himself was one of the closest heirs to Scandinavian monarchies, was influential enough to get his nephew Count Christiern (Christian VII) of Oldenburg elected King of Denmark.

When the Adolphus had died in 1459 without issue the Schauenburg dynasty in Holstein-Rendsburg had thus became extinct. The Schauenburg counts of Holstein-Pinneberg had no claim to succession in Schleswig; their election in Holstein-Rendsburg would have separated Schleswig and Holstein-Rendsburg. The separation of Schleswig and Holstein would have meant economic ruin for many nobles of Holstein. Moreover, the Holsatian nobles, mostly of German ethnicity, failed to agree on which course to take.

Therefore, it was easy for King Christian I of Denmark (son of Hedwig, the sister of the late duke-count Adolphus) to secure his election both as duke of Schleswig and count of Holstein-Rendsburg. In 1460, King Christian called the nobility to Ribe, and on March 2, 1460, the nobles agreed to elect him as successor of Count Adolphus VIII as the new count of Holstein-Rendsburg, in order to prevent the separation of the two provinces. King Christian I, though he had been forced to swear to the Constitutio Valdemariana, succeeded in asserting his claim to Schleswig in right of his mother, Adolphus' sister. On 5 March 1460 Christian granted a coronation charter (or Freiheitsbrief), issued first at Ribe (Treaty of Ribe, , ) and afterwards at Kiel, which also repeated that Schleswig and Holstein-Rendsburg must remain united ""dat se bliven ewich tosamende ungedelt"" (Middle Low German or Low Saxon, i.e. that they remain for ever together undivided). Christian's ascension in the County of Holstein-Rendsburg was the first succession in Holstein in female line.

The Treaty of Ribe was a proclamation made by King Christian I of Denmark to a number of German nobles enabling himself to become count of Holstein-Rendsburg and regain the Danish duchy of Schleswig. Another clause gave the nobility the right to revolt should the king break the agreement (a usual feature of medieval coronation charters). Regarding Holstein-Rendsburg, the arrangement was pretty straightforward, the King of Denmark became in personal union count of Holstein-Rendsburg but was not allowed to annex the county, which was part of the Holy Roman Empire, to Denmark proper in real union.

Regarding Schleswig the arrangement seems at first rather odd, since Schleswig was a fief under the Danish crown, thus making the Danish king his own vassal. However, the nobles saw this arrangement as a guarantee against too strong Danish domination and as a guarantee against a partition of Holstein between Danish nobles. The most important consequence of this agreement was the exclusion of Schleswig in subsequent Danish laws (although the medieval Danish Code of Jutland (in Danish: Jyske Lov) was maintained as the legal code of the duchy of Schleswig.

Finally, in 1472 the emperor Frederick III confirmed Christian I's overlordship over Dithmarschen (by claim, conquered only in 1559). Frederick III elevated Christian as Count of Dithmarschen, Holstein-Rendsburg, and Stormarn to Duke of Holstein, thus elevating Holstein-Rendsburg, a Lower Saxon subfief to imperial immediacy. In Holstein-Pinneberg, however, the emperor remained only the indirect overlord with the Lower Saxon Duke John V being the immediate liege lord. In the following period of a hundred years, Schleswig and Holstein were many times divided between heirs. Instead of incorporating South Jutland with the Danish kingdom, however, he preferred to take advantage of the feeling of the estates in Schleswig and Holstein in favour of union to secure both provinces.

An important development was the gradual introduction of German administrators in the duchy of Schleswig leading to a gradual Germanification of southern Schleswig. The Germanification did not catch wind, however, before the end of the eighteenth century.

Schleswig-Holstein soon got a better educational system some centuries before Denmark proper and Norway. The German nobility in Schleswig and Holstein was already a numerous range of people, and education added plenty of people to administrative officials pool of the kings. In 16th and 17th centuries particularly, educated Schleswig-Holsteiners were recruited to government positions in Norway (where they supplanted indigenous lower Norwegian nobility from its public positions, being a cause of them developing more like odalbonde class than privileged) and also in Denmark, where very many government officials came from German stock (but the Danish nobility was not suppressed, they other immersed most successful of the newcomers into their ranks). This feature of Schleswig-Holstein being an utilised source of bureaucrats was a reason of Denmark's governmental half-Germanisation in the subsequent centuries before 19th-century romantics.

Early modern age

16th and 17th centuries
Gradual Germanification of southern Schleswig became more intense following the Protestant Reformation, promoted by Duke Christian III in the duchies after his ascension there in 1523 as co-ruling duke with his father King Frederick I. After Christian had succeeded to become also King of Denmark and Norway in 1534 and 1537, respectively, he enforced Lutheranism in all his realm in 1537 (see Reformation in Denmark-Norway and Holstein). The Duchy of Holstein adopted its first Lutheran Church Order in 1542 (written by Bugenhagen). The Counties of Holstein-Pinneberg and Schaumburg remained Catholic until 1559.

With Lutheranism the High German liturgy was introduced in churches in Holstein and the southern half of Schleswig (although the vernacular of more than half of this area was Danish). Whereas at the west coast North Frisian prevailed, about the other half of the South Schleswigers used Low Saxon, which had developed from Middle Low German, as their mother tongue, also prevailing in Holstein. High German started superseding the Danish, Low Saxon and Frisian vernaculars in the area.

After Christian III had consolidated his reign in Denmark and Norway against his adversaries there he concluded with his younger half-brothers, having come of age, to share with them in the rule of the duchies in 1544. Christian III, John II the Elder and Adolf partitioned the Duchies of Holstein (a fief of the Holy Roman Empire) and of Schleswig (a Danish fief) in an unusual way, following negotiations between the brothers and the Estates of the Realm of the duchies, which opposed a factual partition, referring to their indivisibility according to the Treaty of Ribe. The brothers determined their youngest brother Frederick for a career as Lutheran administrator of an ecclesiastical state within the Holy Roman Empire.

 So the revenues of the duchies, deriving from the rights of overlordship in the various towns and territories of Schleswig and Holstein, were divided in three equal shares by assigning the revenues of particular areas and landed estates, themselves remaining undivided, to each of the elder brothers, while other general revenues, such as taxes from towns and customs dues, were levied together but then shared among the elder brothers. The estates, whose revenues were assigned to the parties, made Holstein and Schleswig look like patchwork rags, technically inhibiting the emergence of separate new duchies, as intended by the estates of the duchies. The secular rule in the fiscally divided duchies thus became a condominium of the parties. As dukes of Holstein and Schleswig the three rulers bore the formal title of ""Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Dithmarschen and Stormarn"". With the independent peasant republic of Dithmarschen only claimed. The House of Schauenburg (Schaumburg) continued its rule in the Counties of Holstein-Pinneberg and Schaumburg.

Adolf, the third son of Frederick I and the second youngest half-brother of King Christian III, founded the dynastic branch called House of Holstein-Gottorp, which is a cadet branch of the then royal Danish House of Oldenburg. The dynastic name Holstein-Gottorp comes as convenient usage from the technically more correct Duke of Schleswig and Holstein at Gottorp, the residential palace. John II the Elder, Duke of Schleswig and Holstein at Haderslev, produced no issue, so no branch emerged from his side. The Danish monarchs and the Dukes of Schleswig and Holstein at Gottorp and Haderslev ruled both duchies together as to general government, however, collected their revenues in their separate estates. In 1559 through the Final Feud they conquered and subjected the peasant republic of Dithmarschen, partitioning it into three shares.

Similar to the above-mentioned agreement Christian III's youngest son John the Younger gained for him and his heirs a share in Holstein's and Schleswig's revenues in 1564, seated in Sønderborg, comprising a third of the royal share, thus a ninth of Holstein and Schleswig in fiscal respect. John the Younger and his heirs, the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg (Danish: Slesvig-Holsten-Sønderborg), however, had no share in the condominial rule, they were non-ruling only titular partitioned-off dukes. John the Younger‘s grandsons again partitioned this appanage, Ernest Günther (1609–1689), founding the line of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (Danish: Slesvig-Holsten-Augustenborg), and Augustus Philip (1612–1675) that of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck (known since 1825 as Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg). However, these had no share in the condominial rule and were always mediatised under the King as Duke in Schleswig and Holstein, and no immediate prince under the Emperor as liege lord of Holstein, where they held estates around Plön.

The share of John II the Elder, who died in 1580, was halved between Adolf and Frederick II, thus increasing again the royal share by a fiscal sixth of Holstein and Schleswig. As an effect the complicated fiscal division of both separate duchies, Holstein and Schleswig, with shares of each party scattered in both duchies, provided them with a condominial government binding both together, partially superseding their legally different affiliation as Holy Roman and Danish fiefs. In 1640 the Princes of Schauenburg were extinct in the male line and the County of Holstein-Pinneberg was merged into the royal share of the Duchy of Holstein. Neither the agnatic heirs of Schauenburg nor Holstein-Pinneberg's liege lord the Lower Saxon Duke Augustus could help it.

During the 30-years' War the relations between Duke and King worsened. Finally in 1658, after the Danes had invaded Swedish Bremen-Verden, the Duke cooperated with the Swedes in their counter-attack which almost eradicated the Danish Kingdom. The peace treaties (Treaty of Taastrup and Treaty of Roskilde) stipulated that the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp no longer was a vassal of the Danish Crown in Schleswig. Frederick III, duke from 1616 to 1659, established the principle of primogeniture for his line, and the full sovereignty of his Schleswig dominions was secured to him by his son-in-law Charles X of Sweden by the convention of Copenhagen (May 12, 1658) and to his son Christian Albert (d. 1695) by the Treaty of Oliva, though it was not till after years of warfare that Denmark admitted the claim by the convention of Altona (June 30, 1689).

Christian Albert's son Frederick IV (d. 1702) was again attacked by Denmark, but had a powerful champion in King Charles XII of Sweden, who secured his rights by the Treaty of Travendal in 1700. Frederick IV was killed at the Battle of Kliszów in 1702, and his brother Christian August acted as regent for his son Charles Frederick until 1718. In 1713 the regent broke the stipulated neutrality of the duchy in favour of Sweden and Frederick IV of Denmark seized the excuse to expel the duke by force of arms. Holstein was restored to him by the peace of Frederiksborg in 1720, but in the following year king Frederick IV was recognised as sole sovereign of Schleswig by the estates and by the partitioned-off dukes of the Augustenburg and Glücksburg lines.

18th century
As Sweden in the 1713 Siege of Tönning had lost its influence on Holstein-Gottorp, Denmark could again subjugate the entire Slesvig to the Danish realm; Holstein-Gottorps lost their lands in Schleswig, but continued as independent Dukes in their portion of Holstein. This status was cemented in the Treaty of Frederiksborg in 1720, by which the prior royal and ducal regions of Schleswig were united under the king, while the Duke remained Duke of Holstein-Gottorp under the German Emperor. The frustrated duke sought support for the recovery of Schleswig in Russia and married into the Russian imperial family in 1725. Russian Empress Elizabeth died childless in 1762, and she appointed her nephew, Duke Charles Peter Ulrich of Holstein-Gottorp, to be her successor in Russia. When he ascended the throne as Tsar Peter III of Russia, Holstein-Gottorp came to be ruled in personal union by the Emperor of Russia, creating a conflict of territorial claims between Russia and Denmark.

Peter III threatened war with Denmark for the recovery of his ancestral lands, but before any fighting could begin he was overthrown by his wife, who took control of Russia as Tsarina Catherine II. Empress Catherine reversed Russia's stance, withdrawing her husband's ultimatum and even entering an alliance with Denmark in 1765. In 1767 Catherine resigned Russia's claims in Schleswig-Holstein, in the name of her son (later Paul I of Russia), who confirmed this action on coming of age in 1773 with the Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo. Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, surrendered by the Danish king in compensation, were handed over to Frederick August, bishop of Lübeck, the second son of Christian August, who thus founded the younger line of the house of Gottorp. Schleswig and Holstein were thus once more united under the Danish king (Christian VII), who now received all Holstein, but that formally under the Empire.

19th century
On the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Holstein was practically, though not formally, incorporated in Denmark. Under the administration of the Danish prime minister Count Bernstorff, himself from Schleswig, many reforms were carried out in the duchies, for example, abolition of torture and of serfdom; at the same time Danish laws and coinage were introduced, and Danish was made the official language for communication with Copenhagen. Since, however, the Danish court itself at the time was largely German in language and feeling, this produced no serious expressions of resentment.

The settlement of 1806 was reversed, and while Schleswig remained as before, the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg, the latter acquired in personal union by a territorial swap following the Congress of Vienna, were included in the new German Confederation. The opening up of the Schleswig-Holstein question thus became sooner or later inevitable. The Germans of Holstein, influenced by the new national enthusiasm evoked by the War of Liberation, resented more than ever the attempts of the government of Copenhagen to treat them as part of the Danish monarchy and, encouraged by the sympathy of the Germans in Schleswig, early tried to reassert in the interests of Germanism the old principle of the unity of the duchies. The political atmosphere, however, had changed at Copenhagen also; and their demands were met by the Danes with a nationalist temper as intractable as their own. Affairs were ripe for a crisis, which the threatened failure of the common male heirs to the kingdom and the duchies precipitated.

The Duchy of Schleswig was originally an integrated part of Denmark, but was in medieval times established as a fief under the Kingdom of Denmark, with the same relation to the Danish Crown as for example Brandenburg or Bavaria had to the Holy Roman Emperor. Holstein had as a fief been part of the Holy Roman Empire, and was eventually established as a single united province. Schleswig and Holstein have at different times belonged in part or completely to either Denmark, the Holy Roman Empire, or been virtually independent of both nations. The exception is that Schleswig had never been part of the Holy Roman Empire or the German Confederation before the Second War of Schleswig in 1864. For many centuries, the King of Denmark was both a Danish Duke of Schleswig and a Duke of Holstein within the Holy Roman Empire. The short version is: Schleswig was either integrated in Denmark or a Danish fief, and Holstein was a Holy Roman Imperial fief. Since 1460 both were ruled by the Kings of Denmark with the Dukes of Holstein and Schleswig (since 1544). In 1721 all of Schleswig was united as a single Duchy under the King of Denmark, and the Great Powers of Europe confirmed in an international treaty that all future Kings of Denmark should automatically become Duke of Schleswig and Schleswig would consequently always follow the same line of succession as the one chosen in the Kingdom of Denmark.

The duchy of Schleswig was legally a Danish fief and not part of the Holy Roman Empire or, after 1815, of the German Confederation (German: Deutscher Bund, Danish: Tysk Forbund), but the duchy of Holstein was a Holy Roman fief and a state of both the Empire and later the German Confederation of 1815–1866. It was one of the oddities of both the Holy Roman Empire and of the German Confederation that foreign heads of state could be and often were also members of the constitutional organs of the Empire and the Confederation if they held a territory that was part of the Empire or the Confederation. The King of Denmark had a seat in the organs of the German Confederation because he was also Duke of Holstein and Duke of Lauenburg.

Schleswig-Holstein Question 

The Schleswig-Holstein Question was the name given to the whole complex of diplomatic and other issues arising in the 19th century out of the relations of the two duchies, Schleswig and Holstein, to the Danish crown on one side and the German Confederation on the other.

In 1806–1815 the government of Denmark had claimed Schleswig and Holstein to be parts of the monarchy of Denmark, which was not popular among the German population in Schleswig-Holstein, who had traditionally the majority in Holstein and had gradually increased its dominance in Schleswig as well. However, this development sparked a German national awakening after the Napoleonic wars and led to a strong popular movement in Holstein and Southern Schleswig for unification of both with a new Germany (see German unification), turning out to be Prussian-dominated, as it was.

A controversy in the 19th century raged round the ancient indissoluble union of the two duchies, and the inferences to be drawn from it; the Danish National Liberals claimed Schleswig as an integral part of the Danish kingdom; Germans claimed, besides Holstein, being a member state of the German Confederation, also Schleswig. The history of the relations of Schleswig and Holstein thus became of importance in the practical political question.

The childlessness of King Frederick VII of Denmark worked in favour of the movement for the German unification, as did the ancient Treaty of Ribe, which stipulated that the two duchies must never be separated. A counter-movement developed among the Danish population in northern Schleswig and (from 1838) in Denmark, where the Liberals insisted that Schleswig as a fief had belonged to Denmark for centuries and that the Eider River, the historic border between Schleswig and Holstein, should mark the frontier between Denmark and the German Confederation or a new eventually united Germany. The Danish nationalists thus aspired to incorporate Schleswig into Denmark, in the process separating it from Holstein. The movement for the German unity conversely sought to confirm Schleswig's association with Holstein, in the process detaching Schleswig from Denmark and bringing it into the German Confederation.

The Danish succession
When Christian VIII succeeded his first cousin Frederick VI in 1839 the elder male line of the house of Oldenburg was obviously on the point of extinction, the king's only son and heir having no children. Ever since 1834, when joint succession, consultative estates had been re-established for the duchies, the question of the succession had been debated in this assembly. To German opinion the solution seemed clear enough. The crown of Denmark could be inherited by female heirs (see Louise of Hesse); in the duchy of Holstein the Salic law had never been repealed and, in the event of a failure of male heirs to Christian VIII, the succession would pass to the Dukes of Augustenburg — although this was debatable as the dynasty itself had received Holstein by Christian I of Denmark being the son of the sister of the last Schauenburg, Adolphus VIII.

Danish opinion, on the other hand, clamoured for a royal pronouncement proclaiming the principle of the indivisibility of the monarchy and its transmission intact to a single heir, in accordance with the royal law. To this Christian VIII yielded so far as to issue in 1846 letters patent declaring that the royal law in the matter of the succession was in full force so far as Schleswig was concerned, in accordance with the letters patent of August 22, 1721, the oath of fidelity of September 3, 1721, the guarantees given by France and Great Britain in the same year and the treaties of 1767 and 1773 with Russia. As to Holstein, he stated that certain circumstances prevented him from giving, in regard to some parts of the duchy, so clear a decision as in the case of Schleswig. The principle of the independence of Schleswig and of its union with Holstein were expressly reaffirmed. An appeal against this by the estates of Holstein to the German Federal Assembly received no attention.

On January 28, Christian VIII issued a rescript proclaiming a new constitution which, while preserving the autonomy of the different parts of the country, incorporated them for common purposes in a single organisation. The estates of the duchies replied by demanding the incorporation of Schleswig-Holstein, as a single constitutional state, in the German Confederation.

In March 1848 these differences led to an open uprising by the German-minded Estate assemblies in the duchies in support of independence from Denmark and of close association with the German Confederation. The military intervention of Prussia helped the uprising: the Prussian army drove Denmark's troops from Schleswig and Holstein.

Frederick VII, who had succeeded his father at the end of January, declared (March 4) that he had no right to deal in this way with Schleswig, and, yielding to the importunity of the Eider-Danish party, withdrew the rescript of January (April 4) and announced to the people of Schleswig (March 27) the promulgation of a liberal constitution under which the duchy, while preserving its local autonomy, would become an integral part of Denmark.

A Liberal constitution for Holstein was not seriously considered in Copenhagen since it was a well-known fact that the German political elite of Holstein was far more conservative than the one in Copenhagen. This proved to be true, as the politicians of Holstein demanded that the Constitution of Denmark be scrapped, not only in Schleswig but also in Denmark, as well as demanding that Schleswig immediately follow Holstein and become a member of the German Confederation and eventually a part of the new united Germany.

The rebels established a provisional government at Kiel; and the duke of Augustenburg had hurried to Berlin to secure the assistance of Prussia in asserting around 1848 his rights. This was at the very crisis of the revolution in Berlin, and the Prussian government saw in the proposed intervention in Denmark in a popular cause an excellent opportunity for restoring its damaged prestige. Prussian troops were accordingly marched into Holstein.

This war between Denmark on the one hand and the two duchies and Prussia on the other lasted three years (1848–1850) and only ended when the Great Powers pressured Prussia into accepting the London Convention of 1852. Under the terms of this peace agreement, the German Confederation returned the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to Denmark. In an agreement with Prussia under the London Protocol of 1852, the Danish government in return undertook not to tie Schleswig more closely to Denmark than to the duchy of Holstein.

In 1848 King Frederick VII of Denmark declared that he would grant Denmark a Liberal Constitution and the immediate goal for the Danish national movement was to secure that this Constitution would not only give rights to all Danes, that is, not only to the Kingdom of Denmark, but also to Danes (and Germans) living in Schleswig. Furthermore, they demanded the protection of the Danish language in Schleswig since the dominating language in almost a quarter of Schleswig had changed from Danish to German since the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Nationalist circles in Denmark advocated Danification of Schleswig (but not of Holstein) as Danish national culture had risen much in past decades.

On April 12, 1848 the federal assembly recognised the provisional government of Schleswig and commissioned Prussia to enforce its decrees, General Wrangel was ordered to occupy Schleswig also. The new provisional government accounted for the respect of the two major languages, neglecting Frisian, in Schleswig and appointed two Lutheran general superintendents one each for parishes of Danish and of German language (Johannes Andreas Rehhoff and Nicolaus Johann Ernst Nielsen, respectively).

But the German movement and Prussia had reckoned without the European powers, which were united in opposing any dismemberment of Denmark. Even Austria, like Holstein a member state of the German Confederation, refused to assist in enforcing the German view. Swedish troops landed to assist the Danes; Nicholas I of Russia, speaking with authority as Head of the elder Gottorp line, pointed out to King Frederick William IV the risks of a collision; Great Britain, though the Danes rejected her mediation, threatened to send her fleet to assist in preserving the status quo. 

Frederick William now ordered Wrangel to withdraw his troops from the duchies. The general refused to obey, pleading that he was under the command not of the king of Prussia but of the regent of the German Confederation, Archduke John of Austria, and proposed that, at least, any treaty concluded should be presented for ratification to the Frankfurt Parliament. This the Danes refused; and negotiations were broken off. Prussia was now confronted on one side by the German unification movement urging her clamorously to action, on the other by the European powers threatening with one voice dire consequences should she persist.

On August 26, 1848, after painful hesitation, Frederick William chose what seemed the lesser of two evils, and Prussia signed at Malmö a convention which yielded practically all the Danish demands. The Holstein estates appealed to the Frankfurt Parliament, which hotly took up their cause; but it was soon clear that the provisional government in Frankfurt of the to-be-unified Germany had no means of enforcing its views, and in the end the convention was ratified at Frankfurt.

The convention was only in the nature of a truce establishing a temporary modus vivendi, and the main issues, left unsettled, continued to be hotly debated. At a conference held in London in October, Denmark suggested an arrangement on the basis of a separation of Schleswig from Holstein, which was about to become a member of the eventually united Germany, Schleswig to have a separate constitution under the Danish crown. This was supported by Great Britain and Russia.

On January 27, 1849 it was accepted by Prussia and the German Confederation. The negotiations broke down, however, on the refusal of Denmark to yield the principle of the indissoluble union with the Danish crown.

On February 23 the truce was at an end, and on April 3, the war was renewed.

The principles which Prussia was commissioned to enforce as the mandatory of the German Confederation were:
that they were independent states
that their union was indissoluble
that they were hereditary only in the male line
At this point the tsar intervened in favour of peace; and Prussia, conscious of her restored strength and weary of the intractable temper of the provisional Frankfurt government, determined to take matters into her own hands.

On July 10, 1849 another truce was signed. Schleswig, until the peace, was to be administered separately, under a mixed commission. Holstein was to be governed by a vicegerent of the German Confederation – an arrangement equally offensive to German and Danish sentiment. A settlement seemed as far off as ever. The Danes of Schleswig still clamoured for the principle of succession in the female line and union with Denmark, the Germans for that of succession in the male line and union with Holstein.

In 1849 the Constitution of Denmark was adopted. This complicated matters further, as many Danes wished for the new democratic constitution to apply for all Danes, including in the Danes in Schleswig. The constitutions of Holstein and Schleswig were dominated by the Estates system, giving more power to the most affluent members of society, with the result that both Schleswig and Holstein were politically dominated by a predominantly German class of landowners. 

Thus, two systems of government co-existed within the same state: democracy in Denmark, and pre-modern estates system in Schleswig and Holstein. The three units were governed by one cabinet, consisting of liberal ministers of Denmark who urged for economical and social reforms, and conservative ministers of the Holstein nobility who opposed political reform. This caused a deadlock for practical lawmaking. Moreover, Danish opponents of this so-called Unitary State (Helstaten) feared that Holstein's presence in the government and, at the same time, membership in the German Confederation would lead to increased German interference with Schleswig, or even into purely Danish affairs.

In Copenhagen, the Palace and most of the administration supported a strict adherence to the status quo. Same applied to foreign powers such as Great Britain, France and Russia, who would not accept a weakened Denmark in favour of the German states, nor acquisition of Holstein (with its important naval harbour of Kiel and control of the entrance to the Baltic) by Prussia.

In April 1850, in utter weariness Prussia proposed a definitive peace on the basis of the status quo ante bellum and the postponement of all questions as to mutual rights. To Palmerston the basis seemed meaningless, the proposed settlement to settle nothing. The emperor Nicholas, openly disgusted with Frederick William's weak-kneed truckling to the Revolution, again intervened. To him the duke of Augustenburg was a rebel; Russia had guaranteed Schleswig to the Danish crown by the treaties of 1767 and 1773; as for Holstein, if the king of Denmark was unable to deal with the rebels there, he himself would intervene as he had done in Hungary. 

The threat was reinforced by the menace of the European situation. Austria and Prussia were on the verge of war, The sole hope of preventing Russia from throwing her sword into the scale of Austria lay in settling the Schleswig-Holstein question as Russia desired. Frederick William's only alternative, an alliance with Louis Napoleon, who already dreamed of acquiring the Rhine frontier for France at the price of his aid in establishing German sea-power by the cession of the duchies, was abhorrent to him.

After the First Schleswig War
A peace treaty was signed between Prussia and Denmark on July 2, 1850.  Both parties reserved all their antecedent rights.  Denmark was satisfied, since the treaty empowered the King to restore his authority in Holstein as Duke with or without the consent of the German Confederation.
 
Danish troops now marched in to coerce the refractory duchies; but while the fighting went on negotiations among the powers continued, and on August 2, 1850 Great Britain, France, Russia and Norway-Sweden signed a protocol, to which Austria subsequently adhered, approving the principle of restoring the integrity of the Danish monarchy. The provisional Schleswig government was deposed, as were the Lutheran general superintendents, who were even exiled from the Oldenburg-ruled monarchies in 1850. Their position remained vacant with Superintendent Christoph Carl Julius Asschenfeldt officiating per pro.

The Copenhagen government, which in May 1851 made an abortive attempt to come to an understanding with the inhabitants of the duchies by convening an assembly of notables at Flensburg, issued on December 6, 1851 a project for the future organisation of the monarchy on the basis of the equality of its constituent states, with a common ministry; and on January 28, 1852 a royal letter announced the institution of a unitary state which, while maintaining the fundamental constitution of Denmark, would increase the parliamentary powers of the estates of the two duchies. This proclamation was approved by Prussia and Austria, and by the German Federal Assembly insofar as it affected Holstein and Lauenburg. The question of the succession was the next approached. Only the question of the Augustenburg succession made an agreement between the powers impossible, and on March 31, 1852 the duke of Augustenburg resigned his claim in return for a money payment. Further adjustments followed.

Another factor which doomed Danish interests, was that not only was the power of German culture rising, but so were conflicts with German States in the south, namely Prussia and Austria. Schleswig and Holstein would, of course and inevitably, become the subject of a territorial dispute involving military encounters among the three states, Denmark, Prussia and Austria.

Danish government found itself nervous as it became expected that Frederik VII would leave no son, and that upon his death, under Salic law, the possible Crown Princess would have no actual legal right to Schleswig and Holstein (of course that was debatable, as the dynasty itself had received Holstein by Christian I being son of the sister of last Schauenburg count of Holstein, but Salic Law was convenient to German nationalists in this case, furthermore Schleswig was a fief to the kings of Denmark with the Danish Kings Law, Kongeloven). Ethnic-Danish citizens of Schleswig (South Jutland) panicked over the possibility of being separated from their mother country, agitated against the German element, and demanded that Denmark declare Schleswig an integral part of Denmark, which outraged German nationalists.

Holstein was part of the territory of the German Confederation, with which an annexation of whole Schleswig and Holstein to Denmark would have been incompatible. This gave a good pretext to Prussia to engage in war with Denmark in order to seize Schleswig and Holstein for itself, both by pleasing nationalists by 'liberating' Germans from Danish rule, and by implementing the law of the German Confederation.

After the renunciation by the emperor of Russia and others of their eventual rights, Charlotte, Landgravine of Hesse, sister of Christian VIII, and her son Prince Frederick transferred their rights to the latter's sister Louise, who in her turn transferred them to her husband Prince Christian of Glücksburg.

On May 8, 1852, this arrangement received international sanction by the protocol signed in London by the five great powers and Norway and Sweden.

On July 31, 1853, Frederick VII of Denmark gave his assent to a law settling the crown on Prince Christian, prince of Denmark, and his male heirs. The protocol of London, while consecrating the principle of the integrity of Denmark, stipulated that the rights of the German Confederation in Holstein and Lauenburg should remain unaffected. It was, in fact, a compromise, and left the fundamental issues unsettled. The German Federal Assembly had not been represented in London, and the terms of the protocol were regarded in German states as a humiliation. As for the Danes, they were far from being satisfied with the settlement, which they approved only insofar as it gave them a basis for a more vigorous prosecution of their unionist schemes.

On February 15 and June 11, 1854 Frederick VII, after consulting the estates, promulgated special constitutions for Schleswig and Holstein respectively, under which the provincial assemblies received certain very limited powers.

On July 26, 1854 he published a common Danish constitution for the whole monarchy; it was little more unitary than a veiled absolutism. In 1854 the Lutheran church bodies of Schleswig and Holstein, until then led by general superintendents, until 1640 titled general provosts, were converted into Lutheran dioceses called Stift Schleswig (Danish: Slesvig Stift) and Stift Holstein (Danish: Holsten Stift), each presided by a Lutheran bishop. Ulrich Sechmann Boesen became Bishop for Schleswig (as of 1854), and Wilhelm Heinrich Koopmann was appointed Bishop for Holstein (offic. 1855–1871).

On October 2, 1855 the common Danish constitution was superseded by a parliamentary constitution of a modified type. The legality of this constitution was disputed by the two German great powers, on the ground that the estates of the duchies had not been consulted as promised in the royal letter of December 6, 1851.

On February 11, 1858 the federal assembly of the German Confederation refused to admit its validity so far as Holstein and Lauenburg were concerned.

In the early 1860s the ""Schleswig-Holstein Question"" once more became the subject of lively international debate, but with the difference that support for the Danish position was in decline. The Crimean War had crippled the power of Russia, and France was prepared to renounce support for Danish interests in the duchies in exchange for compensations to herself elsewhere.

Queen Victoria and her consort Prince Albert had sympathy for the German position, but it was tempered by British ministers who saw the growth of German sea-power in the Baltic Sea as a danger to British naval supremacy, and consequently Great Britain sided with the Danes.

To that was added a grievance about tolls charged on shipping passing through the Danish Straits to pass between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. To avoid that expense, Prussia planned the Kiel Canal, which could not be built as long as Denmark ruled Holstein.

The secessionist movement continued throughout the 1850s and 1860s, as proponents of German unification increasingly expressed the wish to include two Danish-ruled provinces Holstein and Schleswig in an eventual 'Greater Germany'. Holstein was completely German, while the situation in Schleswig was complex. It was linguistically mixed between German, Danish and North Frisian. The population was predominantly of Danish ethnicity, but many of them had switched to the German language since the 17th century. German culture dominated in clergy and nobility, whereas Danish had a lower social status. For centuries, when the rule of the King was absolute, these conditions had created few tensions. When ideas of democracy spread and national currents emerged from ca. 1820, some professed sympathy with German, others with Danish nationality.

The medieval Treaty of Ribe had proclaimed that Schleswig and Holstein were indivisible, however in another context. As the events of 1863 threatened to politically divide the two duchies, Prussia was handed a good pretext to engage in war with Denmark to seize Schleswig-Holstein for itself, both by pleasing nationalists in ""liberating"" Germans from Danish rule, and by implementing the law of the German Confederation.

On July 29, 1853, In response to the renewed Danish claim to Schleswig as integral Danish territory, the German Federal Assembly (instructed by Bismarck) threatened German federal intervention.

On November 6, 1853, Frederick VII issued a proclamation abolishing the Danish constitution so far as it affected Holstein and Lauenburg, while keeping it for Denmark and Schleswig.

Even this concession violated the principle of the indissoluble union of the duchies, but the German Federal Assembly, fully occupied at home, determined to refrain from further action till the Danish parliament should make another effort to pass a law or budget affecting the whole kingdom without consulting the estates of the duchies.

In July 1860 this happened, and in the spring of 1861 the estates were once more at open odds with the Danish government. The German Federal Assembly now prepared for armed intervention; but it was in no condition to carry out its threats, and Denmark decided, on the advice of Great Britain, to ignore it and open negotiations directly with Prussia and Austria as independent powers. These demanded the restoration of the union between the duchies, a question beyond the competence of the Confederation. Denmark replied with a refusal to recognise the right of any foreign power to interfere in her relations with Schleswig; to which Austria, anxious to conciliate the smaller German princes, responded with a vigorous protest against Danish infringements of the compact of 1852.

Lord John Russell now intervened, on behalf of Great Britain, with a proposal for a settlement of the whole question on the basis of the independence of the duchies under the Danish crown, with a decennial budget for common expenses to be agreed on by the four assemblies, and a supreme council of state consisting in relative proportion of Danes and Germans. This was accepted by Russia and by the German great powers, and Denmark found herself isolated in Europe. The international situation, however, favoured a bold attitude, and she met the representations of the powers with a flat defiance. The retention of Schleswig as an integral part of the monarchy was to Denmark a matter of life and death; the German Confederation had made the terms of the protocol of 1852, defining the intimate relations between the duchies, the excuse for unwarrantable interference in the internal affairs of the Denmark.

On March 30, 1863, as a result of this, a royal compact's proclamation was published at Copenhagen repudiating the compacts of 1852, and, by defining the separate position of Holstein in the Danish monarchy, negativing once for all the German claims upon Schleswig.

Three main movements had evolved, each with its goal:

A German movement in the two duchies dreamt of an independent Schleswig-Holstein under a liberal constitution. First a personal union with Denmark was outlined, as proposed by Uwe Jens Lornsen in 1830. Later, as it the succession problem appeared and the national sympathies of Danish royalty became evident, the Schleswig-Holstein movement called for an independent state ruled by the house of Augustenburg, a cadet branch of the Danish royal House of Oldenburg. The movement largely ignored the fact that the northern half of Schleswig was predominantly Danish-minded.
In Denmark, nationalists wished a ""Denmark to the Eider River"", implying a reincorporation of Schleswig into Denmark and an end to the century-long German dominance in this region's politics. This scenario would mean a total exclusion of Holstein from the Danish monarchy, barring the conservative aristocracy of Holstein from Danish politics, thus easing liberal reforms. The Eider movement underestimated the German element of Southern Schleswig or thought they could be re-convinced of their Danish heritage.
A less vociferous, but more influential stance was the keeping of the Danish unitary state as it was, one kingdom and two duchies. This would avoid any partition, but it would also not solve the ethnical controversy and the constitutional issues. Most Danish civil servants and the major powers of Russia, England and France supported this status quo.
A fourth scenario, that Schleswig and Holstein should both be incorporated into Prussia as a mere province, was hardly considered before or during the war of 1864. However, it was to be the outcome after the Austro-Prussian War two years later.

As the heirless king Frederick VII grew older, Denmark's successive National-Liberal cabinets became increasingly focused on maintaining control of Schleswig following the king's future death.
Both duchies were ruled by the kings of Denmark and shared a long mutual history, but their association with Denmark was extremely complex. Holstein was a member of the German Confederation. Denmark, and Schleswig (as it was a Danish fief), were outside the German Confederation. German nationalists claimed that the succession laws of the two duchies were different from the similar law in Denmark. Danes, however, claimed that this only applied to Holstein, but that Schleswig was subject to the Danish law of succession. A further complication was a much-cited reference in the 1460 Treaty of Ribe stipulating that Schleswig and Holstein should ""be together and forever unseparated"". As counter-evidence, and in favour of the Danish view, rulings of a Danish clerical court and a German Emperor, of 1424 and 1421 respectively, were produced.

In 1863 King Frederick VII of Denmark died leaving no heir. According to the line of succession of Denmark and Schleswig, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would now pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg (the future King Christian IX), the crown of Holstein was considered to be more problematic. This decision was challenged by a rival pro-German branch of the Danish royal family, the House of Augustenburg (Danish: Augustenborg) who demanded, like in 1848, the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein. This happened at a particularly critical time as work on a new constitution for the joint affairs of Denmark and Schleswig had just been completed with the draft awaiting his signature. In the Duchy of Lauenburg the personal union with Denmark ended and her estates elected a new dynasty in 1865.

The November Constitution
The new so-called November Constitution would not annex Schleswig to Denmark directly, but instead create a joint parliament (with the medieval title Rigsraadet) to govern the joint affairs of both Denmark and Schleswig. Both entities would maintain their individual parliaments as well. A similar initiative, but also including Holstein, had been attempted in 1855, but proved a failure because of the opposition of the people in Schleswig and their support in German states. Most importantly, Article I clarified the question of succession: The form of government shall be that of a constitutional monarchy. Royal authority shall be inherited. The law of succession is specified in the law of succession of July 31, 1853 applying for the entire Danish monarchy. 

Denmark's new king, Christian IX, was in a position of extraordinary difficulty. The first sovereign act he was called upon to perform was to sign the new constitution. To sign was to violate the terms of the London Protocol which would probably lead to war. To refuse to sign was to place himself in antagonism to the united sentiment of his Danish subjects, which was the basis of his reign. He chose what seemed the lesser of two evils, and on November 18 signed the constitution.

The news was seen as a violation of the London Protocol, which prohibited such a change in the status quo. It was received in German states with manifestations of excitement and anger. Frederick, duke of Augustenburg, son of the prince who in 1852 had renounced the succession to the duchies, now claimed his rights on the ground that he had had no share in the renunciation. In Holstein an agitation in his favour had begun from the first, and this was extended to Schleswig when the terms of the new Danish constitution became known. His claim was enthusiastically supported by the German princes and people, and in spite of the negative attitude of Austria and Prussia the federal assembly at the initiative of Otto von Bismarck decided to occupy Holstein pending the settlement of the decree of succession.

Second Schleswig War

On December 24, 1863, Saxon and Hanoverian troops marched into the German duchy of Holstein in the name of the German Confederation, and supported by their presence and by the loyalty of the Holsteiners the duke of Augustenburg assumed the government under the style of Duke Frederick VIII.

It was clear to Bismarck that Austria and Prussia, as parties to the London Protocol of 1852, must and uphold the succession as fixed by it, and that any action they might take in consequence of the violation of that compact by Denmark must be so correct as to deprive Europe of all excuse for interference. The publication of the new constitution by Christian IX was in itself sufficient to justify them. As to the ultimate outcome of their effective intervention, that could be left to the future to decide. Austria had no clear views. King William wavered between his Prussian feeling and a sentimental sympathy with the duke of Augustenburg. Bismarck alone knew exactly what he wanted, and how to attain it. ""From the beginning"", he said later (Reflections, ii. 10), ""I kept annexation steadily before my eyes.""

After Christian IX of Denmark merged Schleswig (not Holstein) into Denmark in 1863 following his accession to the Danish throne that year, Bismarck's diplomatic abilities finally convinced Austria to participate in the war, with the assent of the other European large powers and under the auspices of the German Confederation.

The protests of Great Britain and Russia against the action of the German federal assembly, together with the proposal of Count Beust, on behalf of Saxony, that Bavaria should bring forward in that assembly a formal motion for the recognition of Duke Frederick's claims, helped Bismarck to persuade Austria that immediate action must be taken.

On December 28 a motion was introduced in the federal assembly by Austria and Prussia, calling on the Confederation to occupy Schleswig as a pledge for the observance by Denmark of the compacts of 1852. This implied the recognition of the rights of Christian IX, and was indignantly rejected; whereupon the federal assembly was informed that the Austrian and Prussian governments would act in the matter as independent European powers.

On January 16, 1864 the agreement between them was signed. An article drafted by Austria, intended to safeguard the settlement of 1852, was replaced at Bismarck's instance by another which stated that the two powers would decide only in concert on the relations of the duchies, and that they would in no case determine the question of the succession save by mutual consent; and Bismarck issued an ultimatum to Denmark demanding that the November Constitution should be abolished within 48 hours. This was rejected by the Danish government.

The Austrian and Prussian forces crossed the Eider into Schleswig on February 1, 1864, and war was inevitable.

An invasion of Denmark itself had not been part of the original programme of the allies; but on February 18 some Prussian hussars, in the excitement of a cavalry skirmish, crossed the frontier and occupied the village of Kolding. Bismarck determined to use this circumstance to revise the whole situation. He urged upon the Austrians the necessity for a strong policy, so as to settle once for all not only the question of the duchies but the wider question of the German Confederation; and Austria reluctantly consented to press the war.

On March 11 a fresh agreement was signed between the powers, under which the compacts of 1852 were declared to be no longer valid, and the position of the duchies within the Danish monarchy as a whole was to be made the subject of a friendly understanding.

Meanwhile, however, Lord John Russell on behalf of Great Britain, supported by Russia, France and Sweden, had intervened with a proposal that the whole question should once more be submitted to a European conference. The German powers agreed on condition that the compacts of 1852 (London Protocol) should not be taken as a basis, and that the duchies should be bound to Denmark by a personal tie only. But the proceedings of the conference, which opened at London on April 25, only revealed the inextricable tangle of the issues involved.

Beust, on behalf of the Confederation, demanded the recognition of the Augustenburg claimant; Austria leaned to a settlement on the lines of that of 1852; Prussia, it was increasingly clear, aimed at the acquisition of the duchies. The first step towards the realization of this latter ambition was to secure the recognition of the absolute independence of the duchies, and this Austria could only oppose at the risk of forfeiting her whole influence among the German states. The two powers, then, agreed to demand the complete political independence of the duchies bound together by common institutions. The next move was uncertain. As to the question of annexation Prussia would leave that open, but made it clear that any settlement must involve the complete military subordination of Schleswig-Holstein to herself. This alarmed Austria, which had no wish to see a further extension of Prussia's already overgrown power, and she began to champion the claims of the duke of Augustenburg. This contingency, however, Bismarck had foreseen and himself offered to support the claims of the duke at the conference if he would undertake to subordinate himself in all naval and military matters to Prussia, surrender Kiel for the purposes of a Prussian war-harbour, give Prussia the control of the projected Kiel Canal, and enter the Prussian Customs Union. On this basis, with Austria's support, the whole matter might have been arranged without—as Beust pointed out (Mem. 1. 272)

Austria, the other leading state of the German Confederation, was reluctant to engage in a ""war of liberation"" because of its own problems with various nationalities. After Christian IX of Denmark merged Schleswig into Denmark in 1863 following his accession to the Danish throne that year, Bismarck's diplomatic abilities finally convinced Austria to participate in the war, with the assent of the other European large powers and under the auspices of the German Confederation.

On June 25 the London conference broke up without having arrived at any conclusion. On the 24th, in view of the end of the truce, Austria and Prussia had arrived at a new agreement, the object of the war being now declared to be the complete separation of the duchies from Denmark. As the result of the short campaign that followed, the preliminaries of a treaty of peace were signed on August 1, the king of Denmark renouncing all his rights in the duchies in favour of the emperor of Austria and the king of Prussia.

The definitive treaty was signed at Vienna on October 30, 1864. By Article XIX, a period of six years was allowed during which the inhabitants of the duchies might opt for Danish nationality and transfer themselves and their goods to Denmark; and the right of indigency was guaranteed to all, whether in the kingdom or the duchies, who enjoyed it at the time of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty.

This Second War of Schleswig of 1864 was presented by invaders to be an implementation of the law of the German Confederation (Bundesexekution). After the defeat in the Battle of Dybbøl, the Danes were unable to defend the borders of Schleswig, then had to retreat to Denmark proper, and finally were pushed out of the entire Jutland peninsula. Denmark capitulated and Prussia and Austria took over the administration of Schleswig and Holstein respectively under the Gastein Convention of August 14, 1865. Already in 1864 the Prussian occupying authorities had deposed Bishop Sechmann Boesen.

The north border of Schleswig-Holstein as from 1864 to 1920 differs a little from the north border of the modern Danish county of Sønderjylland: in the east Hejls and the Skamlingsbanke hill were not in Schleswig-Holstein but are now in Sønderjylland county; in the west Hviding and Rejsby were in Schleswig-Holstein. They used to be in Ribe County before the 2007 Danish Municipal Reform.

After the Second Schleswig War
It did not take long for disagreements between Prussia and Austria over both the administration and the future of the duchies to surface. Bismarck used these as a pretext to engineer what became the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. Austria's defeat at the Battle of Königgrätz was followed by the dissolution of the German Confederation and Austria's withdrawal from Holstein, which, along with Schleswig, in turn was annexed by Prussia.

Following the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, section five of the Peace of Prague stated that the people of Northern Schleswig should be granted the right to a referendum on whether they would remain under Prussian rule or return to Danish rule. This promise was never fulfilled, neither by Prussia, nor by united Germany (as of 1871).

In any case, because of the mix of Danes and Germans who lived there and the various feudal obligations of the players, the Schleswig-Holstein Question problem was considered intractable by many. Lord Palmerston said of the issue that only three people understood the Schleswig-Holstein question: one was dead, the other had gone insane, and the third was himself, but he had forgotten it.

This was convenient for Palmerston, as the government knew that Britain was almost powerless on the continent and had no chance of countering Prussia's military or manufacturing might. Meanwhile, in 1864, the Danish royal family, impressed by Victoria's trappings of Empire, arranged the marriage of the Princess to the future Edward VII, so helping to reverse the Anglo-German alliance, which led to the 1914 war. Niall Ferguson in Empire quotes Kitchener in 1914: ""We haven't an army, and we have taken on the foremost military power in Europe"".

The Schleswig-Holstein Question from this time onwards became merged in the larger question of the general relations of Austria and Prussia, and its later developments are a result of the war of 1866. It survived, however, as between Danes and Germans, though narrowed down to the question of the fate of the Danish population of the northern duchy. This question is of great interest to students of international law and as illustrating the practical problems involved in the assertion of the modern principle of nationality.

In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 Prussia took Holstein from Austria, and seized Austria's German allies, the defeated Kingdom of Hanover, Electorate of Hesse, Duchy of Nassau, and the republic of the city-state of Frankfurt. The annexed states became provinces of Prussia, the Holstein and Schleswig merged in the Province of Schleswig-Holstein. The Lutheran Stifter Schleswig and Holstein were merged in the new Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Schleswig-Holstein in 1867. In 1868 the Holy See established the Prefecture Apostolic of Schleswig-Holstein for Catholic parishioners.

Danes under German rule

The position of the Danes in Schleswig after the cession was determined, so far as treaty rights are concerned, by two instruments: the Treaty of Vienna (October 30, 1864) and the Peace of Prague (August 23, 1866). Under Article XIX of the former treaty the Danish subjects domiciled in the ceded territories had the right, within six years of the exchange of ratifications, of opting for the Danish nationality and transferring themselves, their families and their personal property to Denmark, while keeping their landed property in the duchies. The last paragraph of the Article ran:
""Le droit d'indigénat, tant dans le royaume de Danemark que dans les Duchés, est conservé à tous les individus qui le possèdent a l'époque de l'échange des ratifications du présent Traité"".
(""The right of an indigenous person, as well in the kingdom of Denmark as in the Duchies, is preserved for all individuals who have it at the time of the exchange of the ratifications of this Treaty."")

By Article V of the Peace of Prague, Schleswig was ceded by Austria to Prussia with the reservation that the populations of the North of Schleswig shall be again united with Denmark in the event of their expressing a desire so to be by a vote freely exercised. Taking advantage of the terms of these treaties, about 50,000 Danes from North Schleswig (out of a total population of some 150,000) opted for Denmark and were expelled across the frontier, pending the plebiscite which was to restore their country to them. The plebiscite never came. Its inclusion in the treaty had been no more than a diplomatic device to save the face of the emperor Napoleon III; Prussia had from the first no intention of surrendering an inch of the territory that had been conquered; the outcome of the Franco-German War made it unnecessary to pretend that the plebiscite might occur; and by the Treaty of Vienna of October 11, 1878, the clause relating to the plebiscite was formally abrogated with the assent of Austria.

Meanwhile, the Danish optants, disappointed of their hopes, had begun to stream back over the frontier into Schleswig. By doing so they lost, under the Danish law, their rights as Danish citizens, without acquiring those of Prussian subjects; and this disability was transmitted to their children. By Article XIX of the Treaty of 1864, indeed, they should have been secured the rights of indigenacy, which, while falling short of complete citizenship, implied, according to Danish law, all the essential guarantees for civil liberty. But in then Prussian law the right of Indigenat is not clearly differentiated from the status of a subject; and the supreme court at Kiel decided in several cases that those who had opted for Danish citizenship had forfeited their rights under the Indigenat paragraph of the Treaty of Vienna.

Thus, in the frontier districts, a large and increasing class of people dwelt in a sort of political limbo, having lost their Danish citizenship through ceasing to be domiciled in Denmark, and unable to acquire Prussian citizenship because they had failed to apply for it within the six years stipulated in the Treaty of 1864. Their exclusion from the rights of Prussian subjects was due, however, to causes other than the letter of the treaty.

The Danes, in spite of every discouragement, never ceased to strive for the preservation and extension of their national traditions and language; the Germans were equally bent on effectually absorbing these recalcitrant Teutons into the general life of the German empire; and to this end the uncertain status of the Danish optants was a useful means. Danish agitators of German nationality could not be touched so long as they were careful to keep within the limits of the law; pro-Danish newspapers owned and staffed by German subjects enjoyed immunity in accordance with the constitution, which guarantees the liberty of the press.

The case of the optants was far different. These unfortunates, who numbered a large proportion of the population, were subject to domiciliary visits, and to arbitrary perquisitions, arrest and expulsion. When the pro-Danish newspapers, after the expulsion of several optant editors, were careful to appoint none but German subjects, the vengeance of the authorities fell upon optant type-setters and printers. The Prussian police, indeed, developed an almost superhuman capacity for detecting optants: and since these pariahs were mingled indistinguishably with the mass of the people, no household and no business was safe from official inquisition.

One instance, out of many, may serve to illustrate the type of offence that served as excuse for this systematic official persecution. On April 27, 1896 the second volume for 1895 of the Sønderjyske Aarboger was confiscated for having used the historic term Sonderjylland (South Jutland) for Schleswig. To add to the misery, the Danish government refused to allow the Danish optants expelled by Prussia to settle in Denmark, though this rule was modified by the Danish Nationality Law of 1898 in favour of the children of optants born after the passing of the law. It was not till the signature of the treaty between Prussia and Denmark on January 11, 1907 that these intolerable Treaty of Conditions was ended.

By this treaty, the German January government undertook to allow all children born of Danish optants before the passing of the new Danish Nationality Law of 1898 to acquire Prussian nationality on the usual conditions and on their own application. This provision was not to affect the ordinary legal rights of expulsion as exercised by either power, but the Danish government undertook not to refuse to the children of Schleswig optants who should not seek to acquire or who could not legally acquire Prussian nationality permission to reside in Denmark. The provisions of the treaty apply not only to the children of Schleswig optants, but to their direct descendants in all decrees.

This adjustment, brought about by the friendly intercourse between the courts of Berlin and Copenhagen, seemed to close the last phase of the Schleswig question. Yet, so far from allaying, it apparently only served to embitter the inter-racial feud. The autochthonous Germans of the Northern Marches regarded the new treaty as a betrayal, and refused to give the kiss of peace to their hereditary enemies. For forty years Germanism, backed by all the weight of the empire and imposed with all the weapons of official persecution, had barely held its own in North Schleswig; despite an enormous emigration, in 1905 139,000 of the 148,000 inhabitants of North Schleswig spoke Danish, while of the German-speaking immigrants it was found that more than a third spoke Danish in the first generation, although from 1864 onward, German had gradually been substituted for Danish in the churches, the schools, and even in the playground.

After 1888, German was the only language of instruction in schools in Schleswig. But the scattered outposts of Germanism could hardly be expected to acquiesce without a struggle in a situation that threatened them with social and economic extinction. Forty years of dominance, secured by official favour, had filled them with a double measure of aggressive pride of race, and the question of the rival nationalities in Schleswig, like that in Poland, remained a source of trouble and weakness within the frontiers of the German empire.

After World War I
After Germany had lost World War I, in which Denmark had been neutral, the victors offered Denmark a chance to redraw the border between Denmark and Germany. The sitting government of Carl Theodor Zahle chose to hold the Schleswig Plebiscite to let the inhabitants of Schleswig decide which nation they, and the land they lived on, should belong to. King Christian X of Denmark, supported by various groups, was opposed to the division. Using a clause in the Danish constitution that the king appointed and dismissed the Danish cabinet, and using the justification that he felt the Danish population was at odds with Zahle's politics, the king dismissed Zahle and asked Otto Liebe to form the Cabinet of Liebe to manage the country until a parliamentary election could be held and a new cabinet formed. Since Zahle's had support from a small majority in the Folketing his Social Liberal Party and the allied Social Democrats felt that the king had effectively staged a state coup against the Danish democracy. A general strike was organised by Fagbevægelsen to put pressure on the king and his allies. As Otto Liebe was unable to organise an election, M. P. Friis replaced him after a week, and succeeded in holding the election, and as a result the Social Liberal Party lost half their electoral support and their rivals the Liberal Party (Denmark) were able to form the minority cabinet led by Niels Neergaard: the Cabinet of Neergaard II. The whole affair was called the Easter Crisis of 1920.

The Allied powers arranged a referendum in Northern and Central Schleswig. In Northern Schleswig on February 10, 1920 75% voted for re-unification with Denmark and 25% voted for Germany. In Central Schleswig on March 14, 1920 the results were reversed; 80% voted for Germany and just 20% for Denmark, primarily in Flensburg. While in Northern Schleswig some smaller regions (for example Tønder) had a clear majority of voters for Germany in Central Schleswig all regions voted for Germany (see Schleswig Plebiscites). No vote ever took place in the southern third of Schleswig, because the result for Germany was predictable. On June 15, 1920, North Schleswig officially returned to Danish rule. Germany continued to hold the whole of Holstein and South Schleswig, remaining within the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein. The Danish-German border was the only one of the borders imposed on Germany following World War I which was never challenged by Hitler.

World War II
In the Second World War, after Nazi Germany occupied the whole of Denmark, there was agitation by local Nazi leaders in Schleswig-Holstein to restore the pre-World War I border and re-annex to Germany the areas granted to Denmark after the plebiscite — as the Germans did in Alsace-Lorraine at the same period. However, Hitler vetoed any such step, out of a general German policy at the time to base the occupation of Denmark on a kind of accommodation with the Danish Government, and avoid outright confrontations with the Danes.

After World War II
After Germany had lost World War II there again was a possibility that Denmark could reacquire some of its lost territory in Schleswig. Though no territorial changes came of it, it had the effect that Prime Minister Knud Kristensen was forced to resign after a vote of no confidence because the Folketing did not support his enthusiasm for incorporating South Schleswig into Denmark.

Although there was, as a result, a Danish minority in Southern Schleswig and a German minority in Northern Schleswig.

Because of the Expulsion of Germans after World War II the population of Schleswig-Holstein increased by 33 percent (860,000 people).

"Timeline of United States inventions (1890–1945)

A timeline of United States inventions (1890–1945) encompasses the ingenuity and innovative advancements of the United States within a historical context, dating from the Progressive Era to the end of World War II, which have been achieved by inventors who are either native-born or naturalized citizens of the United States. Copyright protection secures a person's right to his or her first-to-invent claim of the original invention in question, highlighted in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the United States Constitution which gives the following enumerated power to the United States Congress:

In 1641, the first patent in North America was issued to Samuel Winslow by the General Court of Massachusetts for a new method of making salt. On April 10, 1790, President George Washington signed the Patent Act of 1790 (1 Stat. 109) into law which proclaimed that patents were to be authorized for ""any useful art, manufacture, engine, machine, or device, or any improvement therein not before known or used."" On July 31, 1790, Samuel Hopkins of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,  became the first person in the United States to file and to be granted a patent under the new U.S. patent statute. The Patent Act of 1836 (Ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117) further clarified United States patent law to the extent of establishing a patent office where patent applications are filed, processed, and granted, contingent upon the language and scope of the claimant's invention, for a patent term of 14 years with an extension of up to an additional 7 years.

From 1836 to 2011, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted a total of 7,861,317 patents relating to several well-known inventions appearing throughout the timeline below. Some examples of patented inventions between the years 1890 and 1945 include John Froelich's tractor (1892), Ransom Eli Olds' assembly line (1901), Willis Carrier's air-conditioning (1902), the Wright Brothers' airplane (1903), and Robert H. Goddard's liquid-fuel rocket (1926).

Progressive Era (1890–1919)
Through most of the 1800s, Americans viewed the nation’s westward expansion as a symbol of its providence as a land of wealth and progress. But Indian tribes resisted the encroachment of settlers in their territories, setting off decades of violence. The federal government gradually pushed the tribes to more isolated areas, offering U.S. citizenship, but few opportunities, to those who agreed to accept allotments of land on reservations.

1890 Stop sign

A stop sign is a traffic sign, usually erected at road junctions such as a four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised the first set of traffic laws in an article published in Rider and Driver. However, the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a stop sign with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign, the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.

1890 Tabulating machine

The tabulating machine is an electrical device designed to assist in summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born. In 1890, Herman Hollerith invented the mechanical tabulating machine, a design used during the 1890 Census which stored and processed demographic and statistical information on punched cards.

1890 Shredded wheat
 Shredded wheat is a type of breakfast cereal made from whole wheat. Shredded wheat also comes in a frosted variety, which has one side coated with sugar and usually gelatin. Shredded wheat was invented in 1890 by Henry Perky of Watertown, New York.

1890 Babcock test
 The Babcock test was the first inexpensive and practical test which were used to determine the fat content of milk. Invented by Stephen Moulton Babcock in 1890, the test was developed to prevent dishonest farmers who could, until the 1890s, water down their milk or remove some cream before selling it to the factories because milk was paid by volume.

1890 Smoke detector
 A smoke detector is a device that detects smoke and issues a signal. Most smoke detectors work either by optical detection or by physical process, but some of them use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by Francis Robbins Upton and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of Thomas Alva Edison, although there is no evidence that Edison contributed to this invention.
   1891 Incandescent Lamp
One of the most dramatic improvements occurred in artificial lighting. Thomas Edison’s development of an electric lamp that did not rely on open flames made lighting more practical for factories, offices, and homes, and transformed city life. 
1891 Ferris wheel

A Ferris wheel is a non-building structure, consisting of an upright wheel with passenger gondolas attached to the rim. Opened on June 21, 1893 at the Chicago World's Fair, the original Ferris Wheel was invented two years earlier by the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania bridge-builder George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. in 1891.

1891 Dow process

The Dow process is the electrolytic method of bromine extraction from brine, and was Herbert Henry Dow's second revolutionary process for generating bromine commercially in 1891.

1891 Tesla coil

A Tesla coil is a type of resonant transformer circuit invented by Nikola Tesla around 1891. Nikola Tesla used these coils to conduct innovative experiments in electrical lighting, phosphorescence, x-ray generation, high frequency alternating current phenomena, electrotherapy, and the transmission of electrical energy without wires for point-to-point telecommunications, broadcasting, and the transmission of electrical power.

1891 Rotary dial
 The rotary dial is a device mounted on or in a telephone or switchboard that is designed to send electrical pulses, known as pulse dialing, corresponding to the number dialed. The early form of the rotary dial used lugs on a finger plate instead of holes. The rotary dial was invented by Almon Brown Strowger in 1891. Strowger filed U.S. patent#486,909 on December 21, 1891 that was later issued on November 29, 1892.

1891 Pastry fork
 A pastry fork, also known as a ""pie fork"", is a fork designed for eating pastries and other desserts while holding a plate. The fork has 3 or 4 tines. The 3 tine fork has a larger, flattened and beveled tine on the side while the 4 tine fork has the 1st and 2nd tine connected or bridged together and beveled. On July 7, 1891, Anna M. Mangin of Queens, a borough of New York City, filed the first patent for the pastry fork. U.S. patent #470,005 was later issued on March 1, 1892.

1891 Schrader valve

A Schrader valve consists of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes a variety of forms depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush with the end of the valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.

1892 Bottle cap
 Bottle caps, or closures, are used to seal the openings of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The crown cork, the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by William Painter of Baltimore, Maryland.

1892 Dimmer
 Dimmers are devices used to vary the brightness of a light. By decreasing or increasing the RMS voltage and hence the mean power to the lamp it is possible to vary the intensity of the light output. Although variable-voltage devices are used for various purposes, a dimmer is specifically those devices intended to control lighting. Dimmers are popularly used in venues such as movie theatres, stages, dining rooms, restaurants, and auditoriums where the need or absence of light during activities requires constant change. The dimmer was invented in 1892 by Granville Woods.

1892 Bicycle seat (padded)
 A bicycle seat, unlike a bicycle saddle, is designed to support the rider's buttocks and back, usually in a semi-reclined position. First known as the ""Garford Saddle"", the padded bicycle seat was invented in 1892 by Arthur Lovett Garford of Elyria, Ohio.

1892 internal combustion-powered tractor
A tractor is a distinctive farm vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanized. While steam powered tractors had been built earlier, In 1892, John Froelich invented and built the first gasoline-powered tractor in Clayton County, Iowa.

1893 Zipper

The zipper is a popular device for temporarily joining two edges of fabric. Zippers are found on trousers, jeans, jackets, and luggage. Whitcomb L. Judson was an American mechanical engineer from Chicago who was the first to invent, conceive of the idea, and to construct a workable zipper. Using a hook-and-eye device, Judson intended for this earliest form of the zipper to be used on shoes. He also conceived the idea of the slide fastener mechanism in conjunction with the invention of the zipper. Patents were issued to Judson for the zipper in 1891, 1894, and 1905.

1893 Spectroheliograph

The spectroheliograph is an instrument used in astronomy that captures a photographic image of the Sun at a single wavelength of light, a monochromatic image. The spectroheliograph was invented in 1893 by George Ellery Hale and independently later by Henri Alexandre Deslandres in 1894.

1893 Pinking shears
 Pinking shears are a type of scissors that have blades of which are sawtoothed instead of straight. Used to cut woven cloth, pinking shears leave a zigzag pattern instead of a straight edge. The earliest patent for pinking shears was U.S. patent #489,406 which was issued to Louise Austin of Whatcomb, Washington on January 3, 1893.

Early 1890s Phantoscope
 A film projection machine created by Charles Francis Jenkins in the early 1890s. Jenkin's machine was the first projector to allow each still frame of the film to be illuminated long enough before advancing to the next frame sequence.

1894 Stadimeter

A stadimeter, a type of optical rangefinder, is an optical device for estimating the range to an object of known height by measuring the angle between the top and bottom of the object as observed at the device. It is similar to a sextant, in that the device is using mirrors to measure an angle between two objects but differs in that one dials in the height of the object. The stadimeter was invented in 1894 by Bradley Allen Fiske, a Rear-Admiral in the United States Navy. The first sea tests, conducted in 1895, showed that it was equally useful for fleet sailing and for navigation. Likewise, the stadimeter proved useful during the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish–American War. U.S. patent #523,721 was issued to Fiske on July 31, 1894.

1894 Mousetrap

A mousetrap is a specialized type of animal trap designed primarily to catch mice. However, it may also trap other small animals. Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location where there is a suspected infestation of rodents. The first mouse trap was invented by William C. Hooker of Abingdon, Illinois, exactly three years before James Henry Atkinson developed a prototype called the ""Little Nipper"". Atkinson probably saw the Hooker trap in shops or in advertisements, and copyied it as the basis for his own model. Hooker received US patent #528671 for his invention, the mousetrap, in 1894.

1894 Medical glove

Medical gloves are disposable gloves used during medical examinations and procedures that help prevent contamination between caregivers and patients. Medical gloves are made of different polymers including latex, nitrile rubber, vinyl and neoprene; they come unpowdered, or powdered with cornstarch to lubricate the gloves, making them easier to put on the hands. In 1894, William Stewart Halsted, the Surgeon-in-Chief of Johns Hopkins Hospital, invented the medical glove in an effort to make medical care safer and more sterile for patients and health care workers.

1895 Cyclocomputer

A cyclocomputer or cyclometer is a device mounted on a bicycle that calculates and displays trip information, similar to the instruments in the dashboard of a car. The computer with display, or head unit, usually is attached to the handlebar for easy viewing. In 1895, Curtis Hussey Veeder invented the cyclometer.

1895 Clipless pedal
 Clipless pedals are bicycle pedals that require a special cycling shoe with a cleat fitted to the sole, which locks into a mechanism in the pedal and thus holds the shoe firmly to the pedal. Most clipless pedals lock onto the cleat when stepped on firmly and unlock when the heel is twisted outward, although in some cases the locking mechanism is built into the cleat instead of the pedal. The clipless pedal was invented in 1895 by Charles Hanson of Peace Dale, Rhode Island.

1895 Volleyball

Volleyball is an Olympic sport in which two teams of 6 active players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points against one another by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules. William G. Morgan invented the sport first known as ""Mintonnette"" in 1895 while studying at a YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts. It was later renamed volleyball by Alfred S. Halstead.

1897 Cotton candy

Cotton candy is a soft confection made from sugar that is heated and spun into slim threads that look like a mass of cotton. It was co-invented in 1897 by William Morrison and John C. Wharton, candy-makers from Nashville, Tennessee.

1897 Muffler

A muffler is a device for reducing the amount of noise emitted by a machine. On internal combustion engines, the engine exhaust blows out through the muffler. The internal combustion engine muffler was invented by Milton O. Reeves who received a patent in 1897.

1897 Tapered roller bearing
 Tapered roller bearings are bearings that can take large axial forces as well as being able to sustain large radial forces. They were co-invented by German-American Henry Timken and Reginald Heinzelman. On August 27, 1897, Timken and Heizelman filed U.S. patent #606,635 which was issued to them jointly on June 28, 1898.

1897 Ice cream scoop
 An ice cream scoop is any specialized spoon used to dish and serve ice cream. Most ice cream scoops are hemispherical-shaped and contain a mechanical device to force the ice cream out of the scoop. The ice cream scoop was invented by African-American Alfred L. Cralle who was issued U.S. patent #576,395 on February 2, 1897.

1897 Charcoal briquette
 A charcoal briquette, or briquet is a block of flammable charcoal matter which is used as fuel to start and maintain a fire, mainly used for food preparation over an open fire or a barbecue. Charcoal briquettes are made by using a process which consists of compressing charcoal, typically made from sawdust and other wood by-products, with a binder and other additives. The binder is usually starch. Some charcoal briquettes may also include brown coal, mineral carbon, borax, sodium nitrate, limestone, raw sawdust, and other additives like paraffin or petroleum solvents to aid in ignition. The design of the charcoal briquette was invented and patented by Ellsworth B. A. Zwoyer in 1897.

1897 Billiards cue chalk
 Cue chalk is a calcite or carbonate base applied to the tip of the cue stick used in billiards in order for players to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, as well as for a smoother stroke. Cue tip chalk was co-invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro William A. Spinks and chemist William Hoskins in 1897. U.S. patent #578,514 for cue chalk was issued to Spinks and Hoskins on March 9, 1897.

1898 Candy corn

Candy corn is a confection in the United States and Canada, popular primarily in autumn around Halloween, that mimics the shape and coloration of corn kernels—a broad yellow end, a tapered orange center, and a pointed white tip. Candy corn is made primarily from sugar, corn syrup, artificial coloring and binders. It is generally thought that George Renninger, an employee of the Wunderlee Candy Company, invented candy corn in the 1880s. However, the earliest references credit the Goelitz Confectionery Company, now known as the Jelly Belly Candy Company, for introducing candy corn or ""chicken feed"" to the American public in 1898.

 1898 Remote control

A remote control is an electronic device used to operate any machine, such as a television, remotely. Many of these remotes communicate to their respective devices through infrared signals and radio control. In Madison Square Garden, at the Electrical Exhibition, Nikola Tesla gave the first demonstration of a boat propelling in water, controlled by his remote control which he designed using radio signals. Tesla received a patent for his invention in 1898.

1898 Semi-automatic shotgun
 A semi-automatic, or self-loading shot gun is a firearm that requires only a trigger pull for each round that is fired, unlike a single-action revolver, a pump-action firearm, a bolt-action firearm, or a lever-action firearm, which all require the shooter to chamber each successive round manually. In 1898, John Moses Browning invented the first semi-sutomatic shot gun, later patenting it in 1900. Naming it the Auto-5, Browning's semi-automatic relied on long recoil operation. This design remained the dominant form in semi-automatic shotguns for approximately 50 years, being widely used and the preferred weapon of choice among soldiers fighting in World War I. Production of the Auto-5 ceased in 1999.

1898 Semi-truck 
A type of truck connected to a detachable semi-trailer that carries freight. Developed by Alexander Winton as a means of transporting cars without wasting their mileage.

1898 Filing cabinet (vertical)
 A filing cabinet is a piece of office furniture usually used to store paper documents in file folders. In the most simple sense, it is an enclosure for drawers in which items are stored. A vertical file cabinet has drawers that extend from the short side (typically 15 inches) of the cabinet. The vertical filing cabinet was invented by Edwin G. Seibels in 1898, thus revolutionizing efficient record-keeping and archiving by creating space for offices, schools, and businesses.

1898 Installer bit
 Installer bits are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. Installer bits are also known as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits. The key distinguishing feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through this transverse hole, and the bit pulled back through the drilled hole. The installer bit was invented and patented by Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York in 1898.

1898 Sousaphone
 The sousaphone, sometimes referred to as a marching tuba, is a wearable tuba descended from the hélicon. It was designed such that it fits around the body of the wearer and so it can be easily played while being worn. The sousaphone is named after John Philip Sousa but was invented by C.G. Conn in 1898.

1899 Wing warping

Wing warping consists of the twisting motion of the wings of an aircraft to produce lateral control. The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to Wilbur Wright who in 1899, came up with the idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by the twisting of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their 1899 glider that used ropes to pull on the wings. Later on, the young French engineer Robert Esnault-Pelterie replaced wing warping in 1904 with the aileron on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider. However, it was Henry Farman, a French aviator, who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908.

1899 Flash-lamp

The electric flash-lamp is a device that uses an electrical circuit to trigger a fuse to ignite explosive powder such as magnesium, for a brief sudden burst of bright light ""flash"" from a chemical reaction of flash powder burning. It was principally used for flash photography in the early 20th century, but had other uses as well. The flash-lamp was invented and patented on November 7, 1899 by New York City resident Joshua Lionel Cowen.

1900 Duckpin bowling

Duckpin bowling is a variation of bowling that uses balls which are significantly smaller than those used in ten-pin bowling, weighing  each, which are devoid of finger holes. The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a ""flock of flying ducks"". While the rules remained almost identical to those of the Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6-inch ball. Thus, the inventor of duckpin bowling, John Van Sant, used a wood turner to do exactly that.

1900 Nickel-zinc battery
 A nickel-zinc battery is a type of rechargeable battery that may be used in cordless power tools, cordless telephone, digital cameras, battery operated lawn and garden tools, professional photography, flashlights, electric bike, and light electric vehicle sectors. In 1900, Thomas Alva Edison filed U.S. Patent #684,204 for the nickel-zinc battery. It was issued on October 8, 1901.

1900 Merrill-Crowe process
 The Merrill-Crowe process is a separation technique for removing gold from a cyanide solution. The basic process was conceptualized and patented by Charles Washington Merrill around 1900, then later refined by Thomas B. Crowe, working for the Merrill Company.

1900 Carbide lamp
 Carbide lamps, also known as acetylene gas lamps, are simple lamps that produce and burn acetylene which is created by the reaction of calcium carbide with water. The first carbide lamp was invented and patented in New York City on August 28, 1900 by Frederick Baldwin.

1900 Fly swatter
 A fly swatter is a hand-held device for swatting and killing flies and other insects. The first modern fly-destruction device was invented in 1900 by Robert R. Montgomery, an entrepreneur based in Decatur, Illinois. On January 9, 1900, Montgomery was issued U.S. patent #640,790 for the ""Fly-Killer"".

1900 Thumbtack
 A thumbtack is a short nail or pin with a large, slightly rounded head made of metal which is used to fasten documents to a background for public display and which can easily be inserted or removed by hand. The thumbtack was invented by Edwin Moore around 1900, the year in which he founded the Moore Push-Pin Company.

1901 Key punch
 A keypunch is a device for manually entering data into punched cards by precisely punching holes at locations designated by the keys struck by the operator. Early keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were mechanized, often resembling a small desk, with a keyboard similar to a typewriter, and with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for punched cards. In 1901, Herman Hollerith invented and patented the mechanical key punch that was operated by keys, like a typewriter, and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch. Later models would be motor driven with rudimentary programming features.

1901 Mercury-vapor lamp
 A mercury-vapor lamp is a gas discharge lamp which uses mercury in an excited state to produce light. The arc discharge is generally confined to a small fused quartz arc tube mounted within a larger borosilicate glass bulb. The outer bulb may be clear or coated with a phosphor. In either case, the outer bulb provides thermal insulation, protection from ultraviolet radiation, and a convenient mounting for the fused quartz arc tube. In 1901, Peter Cooper Hewitt invented and patented the mercury-vapor lamp.

1901 Assembly line

Used globally around the world, an assembly line is a manufacturing process in which interchangeable parts are added to a product in a sequential manner in order to create a finished product more quickly than with older methods. This type of manufacturing greatly reduces the amount of time taken to assemble a product, thus reducing production, material, and labor costs so that an affordable product cost can be passed onto consumers. According to a book entitled Michigan Yesterday & Today authored by Robert W. Domm, the assembly line and its basic concept is credited to Ransom Olds, who used it to build the first mass-produced automobile, the Oldsmobile Curved Dash. Olds patented the assembly line concept, which he put to work in his Olds Motor Vehicle Company factory in 1901. This development is often overshadowed by Henry Ford, who perfected the assembly line by installing driven conveyor belts that could produce a Model T in ninety-three minutes.

1901 Safety razor (disposable)

A safety razor protects the skin from all but the edge of the blade while shaving skin. King Camp Gillette, a traveling hardware salesman of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin invented the double-edged, disposable safety razor attached to a re-usable razor handle. Beforehand, dull razors were taken to barbers for sharpening. With Gillette's double-edged and disposable blades, a uniform shave on a man's face could be achieved with a fresh blade and disposed after it was used. Gillette applied for a patent in 1901. It was granted in 1904.

1901 Windowed envelope

A windowed envelope is a conventional envelope with a plastic window to allow the recipient's address to be printed on the paper contained within. Windowed envelopes save the expense of printing or labor of addressing, and in addition save time in preparing the message for dispatch when the customary addresses are already on the letter paper itself. Calling it the ""outlook envelope"", Americus F. Callahan of Chicago was the first to patent the windowed envelope. U.S. patent #701,839 was filed on December 9, 1901 and issued on June 10, 1902.

1901 Radio direction finder

A radio direction finder (RDF) is a device for finding the direction to a radio source. Due to radio's ability to travel very long distances and ""over the horizon"", it makes a particularly good navigation system for ships, small boats, and aircraft that might be some distance from their destination. The radio direction finder is the earliest form of radio navigation. It was first patented by American physicist John Stone Stone. He filed on January 23, 1901 and was granted the patent (U.S. Patent 716,134) on December 16, 1902.

1902 Hearing aid
 A hearing aid is an electro-acoustic body-worn apparatus which typically fits in or behind the wearer's ear, and is designed to amplify and modulate sounds for the wearer. Although hearing aids in some form or fashion such as the ear trumpet were developed in previous years, the first electric hearing aid was invented by Miller Reese Hutchison in 1902.

1902 Postage meter
 A postage meter is a mechanical device used to create and apply physical evidence of postage, or franking, to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The postage meter was invented by Chicago inventor Arthur Pitney, receiving a patent for the invention on October 14, 1902.

1902 Teddy bear
 A teddy bear is a stuffed toy bear. They are usually stuffed with soft cotton and have smooth and soft fur. It is an enduring form of a stuffed animal that has become a collector's item. The first teddy bear was invented in 1902 by Morris Michtom, owner of a Brooklyn toy store, who was inspired by Clifford Berryman's political cartoon Drawing the Line in Mississippi that depicted President Theodore ""Teddy"" Roosevelt on a hunting trip in Mississippi who spared the life of a Louisiana black bear cub. Michtom asked for and received President Roosevelt's permission to use his name for the hand-sewn bears called ""Teddy bears"" that he invented and his wife helped construct.

1902 Periscope (collapsible)
 A periscope is an instrument for observation from a concealed position, known for use in submarines. In a simple form, it is a tube in each end of which are mirrors set parallel to each other and at an angle of 45 with a line between them. Periscopes allow a submarine, submerged at a shallow depth, to search for targets and threats in the surrounding sea and air. When not in use, the periscope is retracted into the hull. A sub commander in tactical conditions must exercise discretion when using his periscope, since it creates an observable wake and may be detectable to radar, giving away the sub's position. The invention of the collapsible periscope for use in submarine warfare is credited to Simon Lake in 1902, who called his device the omniscope or skalomniscope. Later, it was made to be raised and turned by hand.

1902 Mercury arc valve
 A mercury arc valve is a type of electrical rectifier which converts alternating current into direct current. Rectifiers of this type were used in electric motor power supplies for industry, in electric railways, streetcars, and diesel-electric locomotives. They also found use in static inverter stations and as rectifiers for high-voltage direct current power transmission. Mercury arc rectifiers were invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1902.

1902 Air conditioning

Air conditioning is the cooling and de-humidification of indoor air for thermal comfort. Using a system of coils as a solution to cool and remove moisture from muggy air in a printing plant that was wrinkling magazine pages, Willis Carrier invented and manufactured the world's first mechanical air conditioning unit in 1902. Carrier's invention – encompassing the first system to provide man-made control over temperature, humidity, ventilation and air quality, was first installed as a solution to the quality problems experienced at a Brooklyn printing plant, Sackett-Wilhelms Lithographing and Publishing Company. Air conditioning not only spawned a company and an industry, but also brought about profound economic, social and cultural changes.

1903 Tea bag

A tea bag is a small, porous paper, silk or nylon sealed bag containing tea leaves for brewing tea. Tea bags were invented by Thomas Sullivan around 1903. The first tea bags were made from silk. Sullivan was a tea and coffee merchant in New York who began packaging tea samples in tiny silk bags, but many customers brewed the tea in them.

1903 Offset printing press
 Offset printing is a commonly used printing technique where the inked image is transferred from a plate to a rubber blanket, then to the printing surface. Ira Washington Rubel invented the first offset printing press in 1903.

1903 Airplane

A fixed-wing aircraft, or airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft whose lift is generated by air pressure differential between the upper and lower wing surfaces. The Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orville Wright of Dayton, Ohio, made the first powered and sustained airplane flights under control of the pilot in the Wright Flyer I on December 17, 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. In the two years afterward, they developed their flying machine into the world's first practical fixed-wing aircraft. By October 1905, the Wright Flyer III was capable and proven to circle in the air 30 times in 39 minutes for a total distance of 24.5 miles. The brothers' fundamental breakthrough was their invention of ""three-axis control"", which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. This required method has become standard on all fixed-wing aircraft. From the beginning of their aeronautical work, the Wright brothers focused on unlocking the secrets of control to conquer ""the flying problem"", rather than on developing more powerful engines as some other experimenters did. Charles Edward Taylor built the first aircraft engine and was a vital contributor of mechanical aspects in the building and maintaining of early Wright engines and airplanes. Although there were many earlier attempts at heavier-than-air powered flight, some of which achieved successful short hops, and disputed earlier claims of sustained flight, the Wright brothers are officially credited by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale, the international record-setting body for aeronautics and astronautics, as achieving ""the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight"". In addition, U.S. patent number #821393 for the airplane, was filed by Orville Wright on March 23, 1903 and was issued in May 1906.

1903 Windshield wipers

The windshield wiper is a bladed device used to wipe rain and dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson is credited with inventing the first operational windshield wiper. In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windshield wipers closely resembles the windshield wiper found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.

1903 Wood's glass

Wood's glass is a light filter used in communications during World War I. An ""invisible radiation"" technique which worked both in infrared daylight communication and ultraviolet night communications, it does not transmit visible light, leaving the 'invisible radiation' as a signal beam. Wood's glass was invented by Robert Williams Wood in 1903.

1903 Wood's lamp

A Wood's lamp is a diagnostic tool used in dermatology which shines ultraviolet light onto the skin of the patient; a technician then observes any subsequent fluorescence. Though the technique for producing a source of ultraviolet light was devised by Robert Williams Wood in 1903 using ""Wood's glass"", not until 1925 was the technique used in dermatology by Margarot and Deveze for the detection of fungal infection of hair.

1903 Baler (round)

A baler is a piece of farm machinery used to compress a cut and raked crop (such as hay, straw, or silage) into compact bales that are easy to handle, transport and store. Several different types of balers are commonly used, each producing a different type of bales – rectangular or cylindrical (round), of various sizes, bound with twine, netting, or wire. The round hay baler was invented by Ummo F. Luebben of Sutton, Nebraska, which he conceived with his brother Melchior in 1903, and then patented in 1910. The invention of the round hay baler revolutionized the laborious task of haying into a one-man, low-cost operation with a machine that automatically gathered the hay, rolled into a round bale, and ejected it.1904 Automatic transmissionAn automatic transmission is an automobile gearbox that changes gear ratios automatically as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Modern automatic transmissions trace their origins to an early ""horseless carriage"" gearbox that was developed in 1904 by the Sturtevant brothers of Boston, Massachusetts.1904 Banana split A banana split is an ice cream-based dessert. In its classic form it is served in a long dish called a boat. A banana is cut in half lengthwise (hence the split) and laid in the dish. There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with scoops of vanilla, chocolate and strawberry ice cream served in a row between the split banana. Although the banana as an exotic fruit was introduced to the American public in the 1880s, it was later in 1904, that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania by 23-year-old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City. According to The Food Chronology, written in 1995 by James Trager, Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice cream on a split banana, topped with chocolate syrup, marshmallow, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry that sold for a dime. Other soda jerks soon imitated Strickler's banana split, albeit in other forms.1904 Pantograph (diamond-shaped) A pantograph is a device that collects electric current from overhead lines for electric trains or trams. The term stems from the resemblance to pantograph devices for copying writing and drawings. In 1904, the diamond-shaped roller pantograph was invented by John Q. Brown of the Key System shops for their commuter trains which ran between San Francisco and the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. A patent was issued on July 5, 1904.1904 Dragline excavator Drag-line excavation systems are heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types are used for road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered by means of a number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.1905 Batting helmetA batting helmet is the protective headgear worn by batters in the game of baseball or softball. It is meant to protect the batter's head from errant pitches thrown by the pitcher. A batter who is ""hit by pitch"", due to an inadvertent wild pitch or a pitcher's purposeful attempt to hit him, may be seriously, even fatally, injured. In 1905, a New York Giants (the team now known as the San Francisco Giants) baseball player named Roger Bresnahan, after missing thirty days of the baseball season and lying in a hospital bed due to a head injury (or beaning), created, with assistance from the A.J. Reach Company, a crude, leather, vertically sliced football helmet over his cap that is considered to be the first batting helmet. The headgear was unpopular, even with Bresnahan at the time, and it wasn't until the mid-1950s that his idea was accepted.1905 Liquid ring pumpA liquid ring pump is a rotating positive displacement pump that is powered by an induction motor and is typically used as a vacuum pump or as a gas compressor. The liquid ring pump was invented in 1905 by Lewis H. Nash. Production soon began thereafter at the Nash Engineering Company. Nash filed U.S. patent #1,091,529 on February 24, 1910 and was issued to him on March 31, 1914.1905 Ice pop An ice pop is a frozen water-based dessert on a stick. It is made by freezing a colored, flavored liquid around a stick. Once the liquid freezes solid, the stick can be used as a handle to hold the ice pop. The ice pop was invented by 11-year-old Frank Epperson in 1905. Living in San Francisco, California, Epperson had left a fruit drink out overnight, with a stirrer in it, thus making it freeze. In 1923, Epperson got a patent on his ""frozen ice on a stick"". Epperson also invented the twin ice pop, with two sticks so it could be shared by two children. The most famous brand name associated with the ice pop is Popsicle.1906 Typesetting Typesetting is the retrieval of the stored letters and the ordering of them according to a language's orthography for visual display. Typesetting was invented by John Raphael Rogers of Brooklyn, New York who filed U.S. patent #837127 on October 8, 1906 and issued to him on November 27, 1906.1906 Flushometer A flushometer, or royal flushometer is a water pressure system that uses an inline handle to flush toilets and urinals. By using pressurized water directly from the supply line, there is a faster recycle time between flushes. The flushometer is still in use today in homes and public restrooms around the world. The flushometer was invented in 1906 by American businessman and inventor William Elvis Sloan.1906 Audion tube The Audion is an electronic amplifier device and was the forerunner of the triode, in which the current from the filament to the plate was controlled by a third element, the grid. A small amount of power applied to the grid could control a larger current from the filament to the plate, allowing the Audion both to detect radio signals and to provide amplification. The Audion tube was invented by Lee De Forest in 1906.1907 Curtain rod A curtain rod or traverse rod is a device used to suspend curtains, usually above windows or along the edges of showers, though also wherever curtains might be used. The flat, telescoping curtain rod was invented by Charles W. Kirsch of Sturgis, Michigan, in 1907. However, they were not in use until the 1920s. Kirsch also invented the traverse curtain rod in 1928.1907 Electrostatic precipitator An electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air) using the force of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulate matter such as dust and smoke from the air stream. In 1907, the California physicist Frederick G. Cottrell invented and received a patent for the electrostatic precipitator.1907 Paper towel A paper towel has the same purposes as conventional towels such as drying hands, wiping windows, dusting, cleaning up spills. However, paper towels can only be used once after they blot wet surfaces. A school teacher in Ashland, Ohio, named Kurt Klier, gave students individual paper squares, so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs. When Arthur Scott, head of the Scott Paper Company heard about it, he decided to try to sell a load of paper that had been made too thick to use as toilet paper.1908 Candy appleCandy apples, also known as toffee apples outside of North America, are whole apples covered in a hard sugar candy coating. While the topping varies from place to place, they are almost always served with a wooden stick of sorts in the middle making them easier to eat. Toffee apples are a common treat at autumn festivals in Western culture in the Northern Hemisphere, such as Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night because these festivals fall in the wake of the annual apple harvest. Dipping fruits into a sugar syrup is an ancient tradition. However, the origin of the red candy apple is attributed to Newark, New Jersey candymaker who conceived the idea of dipping apples into a red cinnamon candy mixture he had on hand. In addition, dipping apples in hot caramel a 1950s American invention attributed to Kraft salesman Dan Walker.1909 Skee ballSkee ball is a common game found in arcades and one of the first redemption games. Skee ball is similar to bowling except it is played on an inclined lane and the player aims to get the ball to fall into a hole rather than knock down pins. The object of the game is to collect as many points as possible by rolling balls up an incline and into the designated point value holes. Skee ball was invented and patented in 1909 by J.D. Estes of Philadelphia.1909 Paper shredderPaper shredders are used to cut paper into chad, typically either strips or fine particles. Government organizations, businesses, and private individuals use shredders to destroy private, confidential, or otherwise sensitive documents. The first paper shredder is credited to prolific inventor Abbot Augustus Low of Horseshoe, New York. His patent for a ""waste paper receptacle"" to offer an improved method of disposing of waste paper received a U.S. patent on August 31, 1909.1909 Suppressor A suppressor or silencer is a device either attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm to reduce the amount of noise and flash generated by firing the weapon. It generally takes the form of a cylindrically shaped metal tube with various internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas, and sometimes by reducing the velocity of the bullet. Hiram Percy Maxim, the son of famous machine gun inventor Hiram Stevens Maxim, is credited with inventing the suppressor in 1909.1909 Gin rummy Gin rummy, or Gin for short, is a simple and popular two-player card game with a standard 52-card pack. The objective of Gin Rummy is to score more points than your opponent improving one's hand by forming melds and eliminating deadwood. Gin rummy was invented by Elwood T. Baker and his son, C. Graham Baker in 1909.1910 Headset A headset is a headphone combined with a microphone. Headsets provide the equivalent functionality of a telephone handset with hands-free operation. They are used in call centers and by people in telephone-intensive jobs. The first-ever headset was invented in 1910, by a Stanford University student named Nathaniel Baldwin.1911 Fifth wheel coupling The fifth wheel coupling provides a pivoting link between a semi-trailer and the towing truck, tractor unit, leading trailer or dolly. Some recreational vehicles have a fifth wheel configuration, requiring the coupling to be installed in the bed of a pickup truck as a towing vehicle. The coupling consists of a coupling pin (or kingpin) on the front of the semi-trailer, and a horseshoe-shaped coupling device called a fifth wheel on the rear of the towing vehicle. In 1911, Charles Martin invented the fifth wheel coupler consisting of a round plate with a hole in it, attached to a frame mounted on his tractor.1911 Erector Set An Erector Set is a toy construction set that consists of collections of small metal beams with regular holes for nuts, bolts, screws, and mechanical parts such as pulleys, gears, and small electric motors. Popular in the United States, the brand name is currently used for Meccano sets (themselves patented in 1901). The erector set was invented in 1911 by Alfred Carlton Gilbert and was manufactured by the A. C. Gilbert Company at the Erector Square factory in New Haven, Connecticut. The first sets were called by A.C. Gilbert ""The Erector / Structural Steel & Electro-Mechanical Builder"". Accessory sets were also available to allow children to upgrade basic sets.1911 Binder clipA binder clip, or a banker's clip or foldback clip, is a simple device for binding sheets of paper together. It leaves the paper intact and can be removed quickly and easily unlike the staple. The binder clip was invented in 1911 by Washington, D.C. resident Louis E. Baltzley who was motivated by a desire to help his father, Edwin, a prolific writer and inventor, keep manuscripts in order. The original design was modified five times, but the essential mechanism has never changed.1911 Automobile self starterAn automobile self-starter is an electric motor that initiates rotational motion in an internal combustion engine before it can power itself, therefore eliminating the hand crank used to start engines. In 1911, Charles F. Kettering invented the automobile self-starter while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company. There had been many attempts at producing an electric starter before, but none of them were successful. Most designs at that time called for the use of an electric motor attached to the engine's flywheel. However, in order to fit in the car's engine compartment, the device would have to be small, and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque.1911 Road surface markingA road surface marking is any kind of device or material that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information for drivers and pedestrians. Edward N. Hines originated the concept of painting a line down the center of a road to separate traffic in opposing directions. They were first used in Wayne County, Michigan in 1911.1912 AutopilotAn autopilot is a mechanical, electrical, or hydraulic system used to guide a vehicle without assistance from a human being. Most people understand an autopilot to refer specifically to aircraft, but self-steering gear for ships, boats, space craft, and missiles is sometimes also called autopilot. The first aircraft autopilot was invented by Lawrence Sperry in 1912. Sperry demonstrated it in 1914, and proved the credibility of the invention by flying the aircraft with his hands away from the controls and visible to onlookers.1912 Electric blanketAn electric blanket is a blanket with an integrated electrical heating device usually placed above the top bed sheet. The first electric blanket was invented in 1912 by American physician Sidney I. Russell. This earliest form of an electric blanket was an 'underblanket' under the bed that covered and heated from below. In 1937, Electric 'overblankets which lie on top of the sleeping person were introduced in the United States.1912 Traffic light (electric)The traffic light, also known as traffic signal, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location. Its purpose is to indicate, using a series of colors, the correct moment to stop, drive, ride or walk, using a universal color code. The color of the traffic lights representing stop and go are likely derived from those used to identify port (red) and starboard (green) in maritime rules governing right of way, where the vessel on the left must stop for the one crossing on the right. In Salt Lake City, Utah, policeman Lester Wire invented the first red-green electric traffic lights.1913 Formica (plastic)Formica is a hard durable plastic laminate used for countertops, cupboard doors, and other surfaces which are heat-resistant and easy to clean. Formica was invented in 1913 by Herbert A Faber and Daniel J. O'Connor of Westinghouse Electric.1914 Regenerative circuitThe regenerative circuit allows an electronic signal to be amplified many times by the same vacuum tube or other active component such as a field effect transistor. A regenerative circuit is often an AM detector, converting the RF signal on the antenna to an audio waveform. Their use of positive feedback greatly increases both the selectivity and sensitivity of a simple receiver. Positive feedback builds up the input signal to very high levels. Edwin Armstrong, invented and patented the regenerative circuit while he was a junior in college, in 1914.1914 Traffic cone Traffic cones, also called toddlers, road cones, safety cones, construction cones, pylons, or Witches' Hats, are usually cone-shaped markers that are placed on roads or sidewalks to temporarily redirect traffic in a safe manner. Traffic cones were invented in 1914 by Charles P. Rudabaker.1914 Fortune cookie A fortune cookie is a crisp cookie usually made from flour, sugar, vanilla, and oil with a ""fortune"" wrapped inside. A ""fortune"" is a piece of paper with words of faux wisdom or a vague prophecy. In the United States, it is usually served with Chinese food in Chinese restaurants as a dessert. The message inside may also include a list of lucky numbers and a Chinese phrase with translation. Contrary to belief, the fortune cookie associated as a Chinese invention is a fallacy. In 1914, the Japanese-American named Makoto Hagiwara of the Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco, California, introduced the fortune cookie and is thus recognized as its inventor.1915 Skeet shooting Skeet shooting is an Olympic sport where participants attempt to break clay disks flung into the air at high speed from a variety of angles. The firearm of choice for this task is usually a high quality, double-barreled over and under shotgun with 28/30 inch barrels and open chokes. The event is in part meant to simulate the action of bird hunting. The shooter shoots from eight positions on a semicircle with a radius of , and an 8th position halfway between stations 1 and 7. There are two houses that hold devices known as ""traps"" that launch the targets, one at each corner of the semicircle. Skeet shooting began in Andover, Massachusetts in 1915, when grouse hunter Charles Davis invented a game he called ""shooting around the clock"" to improve his wingshooting.1915 Single-sideband modulation Single-sideband modulation (SSB) is a refinement of amplitude modulation that more efficiently uses electrical power and bandwidth. Single-sideband modulation produces a modulated output signal that has a bandwidth identical to that of the original baseband signal, unlike amplitude modulation which has double the bandwidth. Although John Renshaw Carson invented SBB in 1915, his patent was not granted until March 27, 1923.1916 Hamburger bun A hamburger bun is a bread roll sliced horizontally containing a hamburger, usually a patty consisting of ground meat that also typically contains lettuce, bacon, tomato, onion, pickles, cheese and condiments such as mustard, mayonnaise, ketchup and relish. The hamburger bun was invented in 1916 by a fry cook named Walter Anderson, who co-founded White Castle in 1921.1916 Lincoln Logs
 Lincoln Logs is the name of a children's toy consisting of notched miniature wooden logs, used to build miniature forts, cabins, and buildings. Lincoln Logs were invented in 1916 by John L. Wright, son of famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright.

1916 Supermarket

A supermarket is a self-service store offering a wide variety of food and household merchandise, organized into departments. It is larger in size and has a wider selection than a traditional grocery store. The concept of a ""self-service"" grocery store was invented by American entrepreneur Clarence Saunders and his Piggly Wiggly stores. Beforehand, customers would shop at a general store where a clerk behind a counter would fetch inventory in limited quantity for customers to purchase. With Saunders' new innovation of self-service, customers would be able to choose a wider selection of goods at competitive prices. Saunders' first store opened in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1916.

1916 Cloverleaf interchange

A cloverleaf interchange is a two-level interchange in which left turns, in countries that drive on the right, are handled by loop roads. To go left, in right-hand traffic, vehicles first pass either over or under the other road, then turn right onto a one-way three-fourths loop ramp (270°) and merge onto the intersecting road. The cloverleaf was first patented in the United States by Arthur Hale, a civil engineer in Maryland, on February 29, 1916.

1916 Tow truck
 A tow truck is a vehicle used to transport motor vehicles to another location, generally a repair garage, or to recover vehicles which are no longer on a drivable surface. Vehicles are often towed in the case of breakdowns or collisions, or may be impounded for legal reasons. The tow truck was invented in 1916 by Ernest Holmes, Sr., of Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was a garage worker who was inspired to create the invention after he was forced to pull a car out of a creek using blocks, ropes, and six men. An improved design led him to manufacture wreckers.

1916 Condenser microphone
 A condenser microphone, also called a capacitor microphone or electrostatic microphone, is a microphone containing a capacitor that has two plates with a voltage between them. In the condenser microphone, one of these plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing the distance between the two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external phantom power. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at Bell Laboratories by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible with the advent of the vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.

1916 Light switch (toggle)

A toggle light switch is a switch, most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers. The toggle light switch is safe, reliable, and durable, but produces a loud ""snap"" or ""click"" noise when a person's finger manually flips the toggle light switch into the on/off position. The design for the toggle light switch was patented in 1916 by William J. Newton and Morris Goldberg of Lynbrook, New York.

1917 Stream cipher

In cryptography, a stream cipher is a symmetric key cipher where plaintext bits are combined with a pseudorandom cipher bit stream, typically by an exclusive-or (xor) operation. In a stream cipher the plaintext digits are encrypted one at a time, and the transformation of successive digits varies during the encryption. Also known as a state cipher, the stream cipher was invented in 1917 by Gilbert Sandford Vernam at Bell Labs.

1917 Marshmallow creme
 Marshmallow creme, better known as marshmallow ""fluff"" in the United States, is a food item that is a sweet, spreadable, marshmallow-like confection. It is typically used with peanut butter on the fluffernutter sandwich. In addition, marshmallow creme and Nutella can be spread on graham crackers to emulate s'mores. Marshmallow creme is a New England creation invented in 1917 by Archibald Query of Somerville, Massachusetts.

1918 Superheterodyne receiver
 In electronics, a superheterodyne receiver uses frequency mixing or heterodyning to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency, which can be more conveniently processed than the original radio carrier frequency. Virtually all modern radio and television receivers use the superheterodyne principle. The superheterodyne receiver was invented in 1918 by Edwin Armstrong. It was introduced to the market place in the late 1920s.

1918 French dip sandwich
 A French dip sandwich, also known as a beef dip, is a hot sandwich consisting of thinly sliced roast beef (or, sometimes, other meats) on a ""French roll"" or baguette. It is usually served au jus (""with juice""), that is, with beef juice from the cooking process. Beef broth or beef consommé is sometimes substituted. Despite the sandwich's name, the French dip sandwich was not invented in France, but in the United States. Both Philippe the Original's and Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet, two restaurants in Los Angeles, claim to have invented the French dip sandwich. Philippe Mathieu may have possibly invented the sandwich by accident around the year 1918, who according to one story, accidentally dropped a sandwich in a pan of au jus. Another story is that a fireman to Philippe's restaurant found his roast beef sandwich roll to be too hard. Thus, Philippe had it dipped in juice. Whatever the origin, Cole's Pacific Electric Buffet also claims to have invented the French dip sandwich as well.1918 Torque wrench A torque wrench is a tool used to precisely apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt. It is usually in the form of a socket wrench with special internal mechanisms. It was invented by Conrad Charles Bahr in 1918. However, it wasn't until much later on March 16, 1937, that Bahr received U.S. patent #2,074,079 for the invention of the torque wrench.1918 Crystal oscillator A crystal oscillator is an electronic circuit that uses the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material to create an electrical signal with a very precise frequency. This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time as used in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The first crystal-controlled oscillator, using a crystal of Rochelle Salt, was invented by Alexander M. Nicholson. However, it is generally accepted that Dr. Walter Guyton Cady was the first to use a quartz to control the frequency of an oscillator circuit. Nevertheless, Nicholson is still regarded as the inventor of the crystal oscillator.1918 Grocery bag Shopping bags are medium-sized bags, typically around 10–20 litres (2.5 to 5 gallons) in volume, that are often used by grocery shoppers to carry home their purchases. They can be single-use (disposable), used for other purposes or designed as reusable shopping bags. The grocery bag with handles was invented in 1918 by Walter Deubener of St. Paul Minnesota. U.S. patent #1,305,198 was issued to Deubener on May 27, 1919.1918 Hydraulic brake The hydraulic brake is an arrangement of braking mechanism which uses brake fluid, typically containing ethylene glycol, to transfer pressure from the controlling unit, which is usually near the operator of the vehicle, to the actual brake mechanism, which is usually at or near the wheel of the vehicle. In 1918, the hydraulic brake was invented by Malcolm Loughead, which replaced the mechanical brake which was used previously on automobiles.1919 Blender A blender is an upright, stationary kitchen appliance used to mix alcoholic beverages and puree food. Blenders are also used to prepare emulsions, such as mayonnaise, and cream soups. In 1919, Polish-American Stephen J. Poplawski of Racine, Wisconsin invented, designed, and manufactured beverage mixers used in preparation for malted milk served at soda fountains. It consisted of a spinning blade on a long rod extending down into a cup. Poplawski patented his invention of the blender in 1922.1919 Silica gel Silica gel is a granular, porous form of silica made from sodium silicate. Silica gel is a solid. The synthetic route for silica gel was invented and patented by chemistry professor Walter A. Patrick at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland in 1919.1919 Toaster (pop-up) The toaster is typically a small electric kitchen appliance designed to toast multiple types of bread products such as sliced bread, bagels, and English muffins. Although not the first to invent the toaster, the pop-up toaster was invented by Charles Strite in 1919, consisting of a variable timer and springs in order to prevent burnt toast. Strite received a patent for his invention on May 29, 1919.

Roaring Twenties and the Jazz Age (1920–1928)1920 Eskimo Pie An Eskimo Pie is a vanilla ice cream bar between two wafers of chocolate and wrapped in aluminum foil. The confection was invented in Iowa in the year 1920 by Danish-American Christian Nelson. First known as the I-Scream Bar, the name was changed the following year to Eskimo Pie at the suggestion of American chocolatier Russell Stover.1920 Jungle gym The jungle gym, also known as monkey bars or climbing frame, is a piece of playground equipment made of many pieces of thin material, such as metal pipe or, in more current playgrounds, rope, on which children can climb, hang, or sit. The monkey bar designation was for the resemblance that playing children had to the rambunctious, climbing play of monkeys, though the term nowadays often refers specifically to a single row of overhead bars designed to be swung across. The jungle gym was invented and patented by Sebastian Hinton of Chicago in 1920.1921 PolygraphNot to be confused with an earlier and different invention with the same name, a polygraph, popularly referred to as a lie detector, is an instrument that measures and records several physiological indices such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity while the subject is asked and answers a series of questions, in the belief that deceptive answers will produce physiological responses that can be differentiated from those associated with non-deceptive answers. The polygraph was invented in 1921 by John Augustus Larson, a medical student at the University of California at Berkeley and a police officer of the Berkeley Police Department in Berkeley, California. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the polygraph was on its 2003 list of the 325 greatest inventions.1921 FlowchartA flowchart is common type of chart, representing an algorithm or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting these with arrows. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields. The second structured method for documenting process flow, the ""flow process chart"", was invented by Frank Gilbreth to members of ASME in 1921 as the presentation ""Process Charts—First Steps in Finding the One Best Way"".1921 Adhesive bandagePopularly known by the brand name Band-Aid, an adhesive bandage is a self-sticking taped and small dressing used for injuries not serious enough to require a full-size bandage. This easy-to-use dressing with adhesive tape was invented by Earle Dickson in 1921.1921 HeadrestIn an automobile, the headrest or head restraint is a device attached to the top of the seat behind the occupant's head. Most headrests are cushioned for comfort, are height adjustable and most commonly finished in the same material as the rest of the seat. The automobile headrest was invented by Benjamin Katz, a resident of Oakland, California, in 1921. U.S. patent #1,471,168 for the headrest was issued to Katz on October 16, 1923.1921 Garage doorA garage door is a large door on a garage that can either be opened manually or by a garage door opener. Garage doors are necessarily large to allow passage of automobiles and/or trucks. In 1921, C. G. Johnson of Detroit, Michigan invented the ""Overhead Door"", the first upward-lifting garage door. To market the garage door, Johnson mounted a small prototype of his door on the back of his Model T Ford and drove around the United States signing up distributors.1922 Blowout preventer (ram)A ram blowout preventer is a large valve that can seal off a wellhead by using ram-types employing steel cut off rams to seal the borehole. During drilling or well interventions, the valve may be closed if overpressure from an underground zone causes formation fluids such as oil or natural gas to enter the wellbore and threaten the rig. In 1922, James Smither Abercrombie collaborated with Harry S. Cameron with the idea of creating a mechanically operated ram-type blowout preventer. A patent was issued in January 1926.1922 Convertible A convertible is a type of automobile in which the roof can retract and fold away having windows which wind-down inside the doors, converting it from an enclosed to an open-air vehicle. Many different automobile body styles are manufactured and marketed in convertible form. Ben P. Ellerbeck conceived the first practical retractable hardtop system in 1922—a manually operated system on a Hudson coupe that allowed unimpeded use of the rumble seat even with the top down.1922 Water skiingWater skiing is a sport where one or more persons is pulled behind a motor boat or a cable ski installation on a body of water wearing one or more skis. Water skiing began in 1922 when Ralph Samuelson used two boards as skis and a clothesline as a tow rope on Lake Pepin in Lake City, Minnesota. The sport remained a little-known activity for several years. Samuelson took stunts on the road, performing shows from Michigan to Florida. In 1966 the American Water Ski Association formally acknowledged Samuelson as the first on record. Samuelson was also the first ski racer, first to go over a jump ramp, first to slalom ski, and the first to put on a water ski show.1922 Radial arm sawA radial arm saw has a circular saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a radial arm saw may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some radial arm saws allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the radial arm saw. A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.1922 Audiometer An audiometer is a machine used for evaluating hearing loss. Audiometers are standard equipment at ENT clinics and in audiology centers. They usually consist of an embedded hardware unit connected to a pair of headphones and a feedback button, sometimes controlled by a standard PC. The invention of this machine is generally credited to Dr. Harvey Fletcher of Brigham Young University who invented the first audiometer in 1922.1922 Neutrodyne The neutrodyne is a particular type of Tuned Radio Frequency (TRF) radio receiver, in which the instability-causing inter-electrode capacitance of the triode RF tubes is cancelled out or ""neutralized"". Louis Alan Hazeltine invented and patented the neutrodyne circuit in 1922 while under contract to the U.S. Naval Yard outside Washington, D.C. Hazeltine's invention effectively neutralized the high-pitched squeals that plagued early radio sets.1923 BulldozerA bulldozer is a crawler or a continuous tracked tractor, equipped with a substantial metal plate or blade, used to push large quantities of soil, sand, or rubble during construction work. In 1923, a farmer named James Cummings and a draftsman named J. Earl McLeod co-invented and created the first designs. A replica is on display at the city park in Morrowville, Kansas where the two built the first bulldozer.1923 Cotton swabCotton swabs consist of a small wad of cotton wrapped around either one or both ends of a small rod. They are commonly used in a variety of applications including first aid, cosmetics application, for cleaning, and arts & crafts. The cotton swab was invented by Leo Gerstenzang in 1923, who invented the product after attaching wads of cotton to a toothpick. His product, which he named ""Baby Gays"", went on to become the most widely sold brand name, ""Q-tip"".1923 Instant cameraAn instant camera is a type of camera with self-developing film. The earliest instant camera, which consisted of a camera and portable darkroom in a single compartment, was invented in 1923 by Samuel Shlafrock. In 1947, Edwin H. Land invented a new camera that produced photographic images in 60 seconds. A colored photograph model would follow in the 1960s and eventually receive more than 500 patents for Land's innovations in light and plastic technologies.1924 Locking pliers Locking pliers, Mole grips or Vise-Grips are pliers that can be locked into position, using an over-center action. One side of the handle includes a bolt that is used to adjust the spacing of the jaws, the other side of the handle, especially in larger models, often includes a lever to push the two sides of the handles apart to unlock the pliers. William Petersen of DeWitt, Nebraska, invented and patented a primitive version of a wrench in 1921. However, it wasn't until 1924 that the first locking pliers with a locking handle that Petersen called the Vise-Grip was patented.1924 CheeseburgerA cheeseburger is a hamburger with cheese added to it. Traditionally the cheese is placed on top of the patty, but the burger can include many variations in structure, ingredients, and composition. The term itself is a portmanteau of the words ""cheese"" and ""hamburger."" The cheese is usually sliced, and then added to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before the patty finishes cooking which allows the cheese to melt. Lionel C. Sternberger is believed to have invented the ""cheese hamburger"" in the 1920s in the Northeast portion of Los Angeles County. The earliest year attributed to the invention of the cheeseburger by Sternberger is in 1924, while others claimed that he invented it as late as 1926. According to American Heritage, ""a local restaurateur was identified as the inventor of the cheeseburger at his death in 1964. Cooking at his father's short-order joint in Pasadena in the early 1920s, the lad experimentally tossed a slice (variety unknown) on a hamburger 'and lo! the cheeseburger sizzled to life.""1924 Earth inductor compassThe Earth inductor compass is a device for determining aircraft direction using the magnetic field of the Earth. The operation of the compass is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction with the Earth's magnetic field acting as the induction field for an electric generator. A variation generated voltage, thus allows the Earth inductor compass to determine direction. The earth inductor compass is an American invention. It was designed in 1924 by Morris Titterington at the Pioneer Instrument Company. Designed to compensate for the weaknesses of the magnetic compass, the Earth inductor compass provided pilots with a more stable and reliable reference instrument.1924 Gas chamber execution A gas chamber is an apparatus for killing, consisting of a sealed chamber into which a toxic gas is introduced. The most commonly used poisonous agent is hydrogen cyanide; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide have also been used. In an effort to make capital punishment more humane, the State of Nevada introduced death by gas chamber. Convicted murderer John Gee took 6 minutes to die.1924 Moviola A Moviola is a device that allows a film editor to view film while editing. It was the first machine for motion picture editing in order to study individual shots in their cutting rooms that determine where the best cut-point might be. The vertically oriented Moviolas were the standard for film editing in the United States until the 1970s when horizontal flatbed editor systems became more common. In 1924, the Moviola was invented in the United States by Dutch-American Iwan Serrurier.1924 Radio altimeter A radio altimeter measures altitude above the terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft. This type of altimeter provides the distance between the plane and the ground directly below it, as opposed to a barometric altimeter which provides the distance above a pre-determined datum, usually sea level. In 1924, American engineer Lloyd Espenschied invented the radio altimeter. However, it took 14 years before Bell Labs was able to put Espenschied's device in a form that was adaptable for aircraft use.1925 Automatic volume control Automatic volume control or automatic gain control (AGC) is an adaptive system found in many electronic devices. The average output signal level is fed back to adjust the gain to an appropriate level for a range of input signal levels. In 1925, Harold Alden Wheeler invented the automatic volume control which remains today, a standard feature of AM radio.1925 Masking tape Masking tape is a pressure-sensitive tape made with an easy-to-tear thin paper, and fly back and a removable pressure-sensitive adhesive. In 1925, Richard G. Drew, an employee of the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3M), invented the first masking tape, a two-inch-wide tan paper strip backed with a light, pressure-sensitive adhesive. Drew filed U.S. patent #1,760,820 on May 28, 1928 and was issued to him on May 27, 1930.1925 Reuben sandwich A Reuben sandwich is a hot sandwich of layered meat, sauerkraut and Swiss cheese, with a dressing, usually Russian or Thousand Island dressing, that is grilled between slices of rye bread. The origins of the Reuben sandwich is disputed. The earliest claim of inventing the Reuben sandwich comes from Omaha, Nebraska, in 1925 when Ukrainian-American grocer Reuben Kulakofsky fed players in a late-night poker game at the Blackstone Hotel in downtown Omaha. The owner of the hotel was so taken with Reuben's sandwich that he put it on the hotel restaurant menu, designated by its inventor's name. It wasn't until 1956 when a waitress at the Blackstone named Fern Snider entered Reuben's sandwich in a national sandwich competition, one of the earliest documentations given to the name of the sandwich. Another story is that the Reuben sandwich hails from New York City. Arnold Reuben, who opened his deli counter in Manhattan in 1928, has been claimed to have invented the Reuben ""eleven years earlier as a sandwich stand in Atlantic City.""1926 Tilt-A-Whirl Tilt-A-Whirl is an amusement ride that consists of seven freely spinning cars, each holding three or four passengers, attached at fixed pivot points on a rotating platform. Designed for commercial use at amusement parks, fairs and carnivals in which it is commonly found, the Tilt-A-Whirl is commonly known for making riders experience nausea. The Tilt-A-Whirl was invented in 1926 by Herbert Sellner, who first operated it at an amusement park in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. More than likely, Sellner discovered its unpredictable dynamics not through mathematical analysis but by building one and trying it out.1926 Garage door openerA garage door opener is a motorized device that opens and closes a garage door. Most are controlled by switches on the garage wall, as well as by a remote control carried in the garage owner's vehicle. In 1926, the electric garage door opener was invented by C.G. Johnson, the inventor of the garage door and founder of the Overhead Door Corporation.1926 Power steeringPower steering is a system for reducing the steering effort on vehicles by using an external power source to assist in turning the roadwheels. In 1926, Francis W. Davis of Waltham, Massachusetts invented power steering.1926 Drive throughA drive-through, or drive-thru, allows customers to purchase products without leaving their cars. In 1926, City Center Bank, which became UMB Financial Corporation under R. Crosby Kemper opened what is considered the first drive-up window. In-n-Out Burger claims to have built the first drive-through restaurant in 1948. Harry and Esther Snyder, the chain's founders, built their first restaurant in Baldwin Park, California, with a two-way speaker to enable patrons to order directly from their cars without the intermediation of a carhop.1926 Liquid-fuel rocketThe liquid-fuel rocket is a rocket with an engine that uses propellants in liquid form. On March 16, 1926 in Auburn, Massachusetts, Dr. Robert H. Goddard, the ""father of modern rocketry"", launched the first liquid-fueled rocket in history, which used liquid oxygen and gasoline as propellants.1927 Bread slicerSliced bread is a loaf of bread which has been pre-sliced and packaged for commercial convenience. The automatic commercial bread slicer was invented in 1927 by Otto Frederick Rohwedder. His machine both sliced and wrapped a loaf of bread. In 1928, the bread slicer was improved by Gustav Papendick, a baker from St. Louis, Missouri.1927 JukeboxA jukebox is a partially automated music-playing device, usually a coin-operated machine, that can play specially selected songs from self-contained media. The traditional jukebox is rather large with a rounded top and has colored lighting on the front of the machine on its vertical sides. The classic jukebox has buttons with letters and numbers on them that, when combined, are used to indicate a specific song from a particular record. The Automatic Music Instrument Company built and introduced the first electric automated musical instrument which later became known as the jukebox during the 1930s.1927 Garbage disposalA garbage disposal is a device, usually electrically powered, installed under a kitchen sink between the sink's drain and the trap which shreds food waste into pieces small enough to pass through plumbing. The garbage disposal was invented in 1927 by John W. Hammes. After eleven years of development, his InSinkErator company put his disposer on the market in 1968.1927 Pressure washerA pressure washer is a high pressure mechanical sprayer that can be used to remove loose paint, mold, grime, dust, mud, and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles, and concrete road surfaces. Frank Ofeldt in the United States invented the steam pressure washer or ""high-pressure Jenny"" in 1927.1927 Resonator guitarA resonator guitar or resophonic guitar is an acoustic guitar whose sound is produced by one or more spun metal cones resonators instead of the wooden sound board (guitar top/face). The resonator guitar was invented in 1927 by John Dopyera.1927 Kool-AidKool-Aid is a powdered drink mix that comes in an assortment of different flavors. ""Kool-Ade"" was invented in 1927 by Edwin Perkins in Hastings, Nebraska. Perkins devised a method of removing the liquid from a drink called ""Fruit Smack"" so the remaining powder could be re-packaged in envelopes, which Perkins designed and printed, all under a new name to be called ""Kool-Ade"". The name of the powdered drink was later to be changed at a later time to Kool-Aid.1927 Corn dogThe corn dog, pogo, dagwood dog, pluto pup or corny dog is a hot dog coated in cornbread batter and deep fried in hot oil, although some are baked. Almost all corn dogs are served on wooden sticks, though some early versions were stickless. Although a contending topic as numerous claims of the origins of the corn dog have surfaced, the earliest reference to what resembles a corn dog appeared in U.S. patent 1,706,491 filed in 1927 by Stanley S. Jenkins and issued in 1929. A competing claim to the invention of the corn dog is by George Boyington, the creator of Pronto Pups (made of pancake batter) who in 1938 or 1939, created a ""batter-dipped, deep fried hot dog"" after a rain storm in Rockaway Beach, Oregon ruined and made his hot dogs mushy. Another story is that Neil Fletcher supposedly invented corn dogs, first selling them at the Texas State Fair in 1942.1927 Negative feedback amplifierA negative feedback amplifier, or more commonly simply a feedback amplifier, is an amplifier which uses negative feedback to improve performance and reduce sensitivity to parameter variations due to manufacturing or environmental uncertainties. It was invented by Harold Stephen Black in 1927.1927 Quartz clockThe quartz clock is a clock that keeps time by using an electronic oscillator regulated by a quartz crystal. This allows for significantly better accuracy than mechanical clocks. The first quartz clock was built in 1927 by Warren Marrison and J.W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories.1928 Recliner A recliner is a reclining armchair. It has a backrest that can be tilted back, causing a footrest to extend from the front. Edward Knabusch and Edwin Shoemaker invented the first recliner in Monroe, Michigan in 1928 when they modified a wooden porch chair so that the seat moved forward as the back reclined. A padded model was later developed.1928 Ice cube tray An ice cube tray is a tray divided into compartments. It is designed to be filled with water, then placed in a freezer until the water freezes to ice, producing ice cubes. The first flexible ice cube tray was invented by Lloyd Groff Copeman in 1928.1928 Bubble gum Bubblegum is a type of chewing gum especially designed for blowing bubbles. Bubblegum was invented by Frank Henry Fleer in 1906, but was not successful; the formulation of Fleer's ""Blibber-Blubber"", was too sticky. In 1928, Walter E. Diemer invented a superior formulation for bubble gum, which he called "" Double Bubble.""1928 Clip-on tie The clip-on tie is a bow tie or four-in-hand tie which is permanently tied, with a dimple just below the knot, and which is fixed to the front of the shirt collar by a metal clip. Alternately, the tie may have a band around the neck fastened with a hook and eye. The clip-on tie was reportedly invented on December 13, 1928 in Clinton, Iowa, USA. The name of the inventor remains unknown.1928 Electric razor The electric razor has a rotating, vibrating or oscillating blade to remove unwanted hair. The electric razor does not require the use of shaving cream, soap, or water. The razor is powered by a small DC motor, and usually has rechargeable batteries, though early ones were powered directly by house current. The electric razor was invented in 1928 by Col. Jacob Schick.1928 Iron lung An iron lung is a large machine that enables a person to breathe when normal muscle control has been lost or the work of breathing exceeds the person's ability. It is a form of a medical ventilator. Philip Drinker invented the iron lung while working at Harvard University in 1928.

Great Depression and World War II (1929–1945)1929 Freon Freon is an odorless, colorless, nonflammable, and noncorrosive chlorofluorocarbon and hydrochlorofluorocarbon refrigerant, which is used in air conditioning, refrigeration and some automatic fire-fighting systems. Refrigerators from the late 19th century until 1929 used toxic gases, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide as refrigerants. This new ""miracle compound"" was co-invented in 1929 by Charles Midgley Jr. and Charles Kettering.1929 Tampon (applicator) A tampon is a mass of absorbent material into a body cavity or wound to absorb bodily fluid. The most common type in daily use is disposable and designed to be inserted into the vagina during menstruation to absorb the flow of blood. The ancient Egyptians first invented disposable tampons made of softened papyrus around 2500 B.C. The ancient Greeks followed this with tampons made from lint wrapped around a small piece of wood. But it was not until 1929 that Earle Haas of Denver, Colorado first invented the modern tampon with an applicator. Dr. Haas submitted the design for patent in 1931, and in 1936, the tampon was first sold in the United States. He later gave his invention the brandname Tampax, which is still one of the main tampon brands today.1929 Eyelash curler An eyelash curler is a hand-operated mechanical device for curling eyelashes for cosmetic purposes. The earliest patent for an eyelash curler was filed on August 15, 1929 and issued to William E. McDonell and Charles W. Stickel of Rochester, New York on April 7, 1931.1929 SunglassesSunglasses or sun glasses are a visual aid which feature lenses that are coloured or darkened to prevent strong light from reaching the eyes. For centuries, Chinese judges had routinely worn smoke-colored quartz lenses to conceal their eye expressions in court. However, these were not intended for blocking sunlight from eyes. It wasn't until the 20th century that what is now considered to be sunglasses were invented. In 1929, Sam Foster invented and mass-produced the first tinted eyewear pieces solely intended to block out sunlight.1929 Frozen foodFrozen food is food preserved by the process of freezing. Freezing food is a common method of food preservation which slows both food decay and, by turning water to ice, makes it unavailable for most bacterial growth and slows down most chemical reactions. Clarence Birdseye offered his quick-frozen foods to the public. Birdseye got the idea during fur-trapping expeditions to Labrador in 1912 and 1916, where he saw the natives use freezing to preserve foods.1929 Cyclotron A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator that accelerate charged particles using a high-frequency, alternating voltage. The cyclotron was invented in 1929 by Ernest O. Lawrence at the University of California at Berkeley.1930 TiltrotorA tiltrotor is an aircraft which uses a pair or more of powered rotors (sometimes called proprotors) mounted on rotating shafts or nacelles at the end of a fixed wing for lift and propulsion, and combines the vertical lift capability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft. In September 1930, George Lehberger devised the basic concept of tilt rotor aircraft, that is, a relatively low disc loading thruster (propeller) that can tilt its axis from the vertical (for vertical lift) to the horizontal (for propulsive thrust). On September 16, 1930, Lehberger was issued U.S. patent #1,775,861.1930 Car audioCar audio/video (car AV) is a sound or video system fitted in an automobile. In 1930, the Galvin Corporation introduced the first commercial car radio, the Motorola model 5T71, which sold for between $110 and $130 and could be installed in most popular automobiles. Inventors Paul Galvin and Joe Galvin came up with the name Motorola when their company started manufacturing car radios.1930 CheesesteakA cheesesteak, or a Philly cheesesteak, is a long, crusty roll filled with thinly sliced sautéed ribeye beef and melted cheese. Generally, the cheese of choice is Cheez Whiz, but American and provolone are common substitutions. The art of cheesesteak preparation lies in the balance of flavors, textures and what is often referred to as the ""drip"" factor. Other toppings may include fried onions, sautéed mushrooms, ketchup and hot or sweet peppers. The cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Philadelphian hot dog vendor Pat Olivieri who one day decided to substitute beef instead of a hot dog in a hoagie bun. A taxicab driver noticed the alluring aroma and asked for his own sandwich. Through word of mouth, Olivieri's sandwiches the following day were highly sought after by taxi cab drivers around Philadelphia. Due to booming business, Olivieri soon opened up his own shop, Pat's King of Steaks on 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue. Eventually, according to legend, he added cheese to the steak. The cheesesteak is considered to be a cultural icon of the city of Philadelphia.1930 Bathysphere A bathysphere is a pressurized metal sphere that allows people to go deep in the ocean, to depths at which diving unaided is impossible. This hollow cast iron sphere with very thick walls is lowered and raised from a ship using a steel cable. The bathysphere was invented by William Beebe and Otis Barton in 1930. William Beebe, an American naturalist and undersea explorer, tested the bathysphere in 1930, going down to  in a  diameter bathysphere. Beebe and Otis Barton descended about  in a larger bathysphere in 1934. They descended off the coast of Nonsuch Island, Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean. During the dive, they communicated with the surface via telephone.1930 Chocolate chip cookie A chocolate chip cookie is a drop cookie which features chocolate chips as its distinguishing ingredient. The traditional recipe combines a dough composed of butter and both brown and white sugar with semi-sweet chocolate chips. Ruth Wakefield of Whitman, Massachusetts invented chocolate chips and chocolate chip cookies in 1930. Her new cookie invention was called the ""Toll House Cookie"" which used broken-up bars of semi-sweet chocolate.1930 Thermistor A thermistor is a type of resistor with electrical resistance inversely proportional to its temperature. The word is a portmanteau of thermal and resistor. The thermosistor was invented by Samuel Ruben in 1930.1931 Electric guitarAn electric guitar is a guitar using pickups to convert its metal string vibration into electricity. This is amplified with an instrument amplifier. The output is altered with guitar effects such as reverb or distortion. The earliest electric guitar, known as a ""frying pan"", was a hollow bodied acoustic instrument with tungsten steel pickups invented by George Beauchamp and Adolph Rickenbacker in 1931. The electric guitar was a key instrument in the development of musical styles that emerged since the late 1940s, such as Chicago blues, early rock and roll, rockabilly, and 1960s blues rock. Electric guitars are used in almost every popular music genre. U.S. patent #2,089,171 was filed by Beauchamp on June 2, 1934 and issued on August 10 1937.1931 Strobe lightThe strobe light, commonly called a strobe, is a device used to produce regular flashes of light. Modern uses of strobe lights serve a purpose for safety warning, and motion detection. Strobes can be found atop most police cars, ambulances, and fire trucks. The origin of strobe lighting dates to 1931, when Harold Eugene Edgerton invented a flashing lamp to make an improved stroboscope for the study of moving objects, eventually resulting in dramatic photographs of objects such as bullets in flight.1931 AerogelAerogel is a low-density solid-state material derived from gel in which the liquid component of the gel has been replaced with gas. The result is an extremely low-density solid with several remarkable properties, most notably its effectiveness as a thermal insulator. It was first invented by Samuel Stephens Kistler in 1931, as a result of a bet with Charles Learned over who could replace the liquid inside of a Fruit preserves jar with gas without causing shrinkage.1931 Bug zapper A bug zapper is a device that attracts and kills insects that are attracted by light. A light source attracts insects to an electrical grid, where they are electrocuted by touching two wires with a high voltage between them. The earliest bug zappers appear as early as 1911. However, the first bug zapper patented was by Harrison L. Chapin and William F. Folmer who filed on September 23, 1931 and received U.S. patent #1,962,439 on June 12, 1934.1932 Miniature snap-action switch A miniature snap-action switch, also trademarked and frequently known as a micro switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, through the use of a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an ""over-center"" mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.1932 Toilet brush A toilet brush is a domestic implement designed for the cleaning of the lavatory pan. The modern plastic version was invented by William C. Schopp of Huntington Park, California, USA. U.S. patent #1,927,350 was submitted on March 24, 1932 and issued on September 19, 1933.1932 Golf cart A golf cart or golf buggy is a small vehicle designed originally to carry two golfers and their golf clubs around a golf course. The earliest known golf cart was an electric one, built in California around the year 1932 by an unnamed golfer who was physically unable to walk to all 18 holes on a golf course. However, it was Merle Williams of Long Beach, California who in 1951, introduced golf carts to the public.1932 Staple remover A staple remover allows for the quick removal of a staple from a material without causing damage. The form of destapler described was invented by William G. Pankonin of Chicago, Illinois. A patent application for the same was filed on December 12, 1932, granted on March 3, 1936, and published on April 3, 1936 as a patent.1932 Radio telescopeA radio telescope is a form of directional radio antenna used in radio astronomy. They differ from optical telescopes in that they operate in the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum where they can detect and collect data on radio sources. Radio telescopes are typically large parabolic or dish antenna used singularly or in an array. Karl Guthe Jansky started the field of radio astronomy serendipitous in 1932 when his directional antenna found radio static that he later identified as coming from the Milky Way.1932 Tape dispenserA tape dispenser holds a roll of tape and has a mechanism on one end to easily shear the tape. Dispensers vary widely based on the tape they dispense. Clear tape dispensers are commonly made of plastic, and may be disposable. Other dispensers are stationary and may have sophisticated features to control tape usage and improve ergonomics. The first tape dispenser with a built-in cutting edge was invented in 1932 by John A. Borden, another 3M employee.1933 Landing Vehicle TrackedA Landing Vehicle Tracked (LVT), also known as amtracks, alligators, or in their fire support variants as buffaloes, were amphibious tracked vehicles capable of crawling out of the water and onto the beach and beyond. Used primarily by the United States Armed Forces in the Pacific War against the Empire of Japan during World War II, later versions were thinly armored, and some were equipped with a light tank turret to provide fire support, making them equivalent to light amphibious tanks. Highly versatile in their use, LVT's landed supplies ashore at Guadalcanal and soldiers ashore at Tarawa, other variations of the LVT were equipped with flamethrowers during the Peleliu Campaign. The LVT was derived from the Alligator, an amphibious vehicle invented by Donald Roebling in 1933 as a rescue vehicle for downed aviators in the Florida Everglades.1933 Multiplane cameraThe multiplane camera is a special motion picture camera used in the traditional animation process that moves a number of pieces of artwork past the camera at various speeds and at various distances from one another, creating a three-dimensional effect, although not stereoscopic. Various parts of the artwork layers are left transparent, to allow other layers to be seen behind them. The movements are calculated and photographed frame-by-frame, with the result being an illusion of depth by having several layers of artwork moving at different speeds. The further away from the camera, the slower the speed. The multiplane effect is sometimes referred to as a parallax process. As a former director and animator of Walt Disney Studios, Ub Iwerks in 1933 invented the multiplane camera using four layers of flat artwork before a horizontal camera.1933 Frequency modulation In telecommunications, frequency modulation (FM) conveys information over a carrier wave by varying its frequency. While working in the basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Edwin Armstrong invented wide-band frequency modulation radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied the frequency of the wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the AM radio dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on wideband FM on December 26, 1933.1933 Impact sprinklerAn impact sprinkler is a type of irrigation sprinkler that pivots on a bearing on top of its threaded attachment nut, and is driven in a circular motion by a spring-loaded arm that is pushed back by the water stream, then returning to ""impact"" the stream. This produces an intermittent diffusion of the stream that provides a uniform waterfall closer to the sprinkler. In 1933, the impact sprinkler was invented and patented by lemon tree grower and farmer Orton Englehardt of Glendora, California.1934 Trampoline (modern)A trampoline is a gymnastic and recreational device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched over a steel frame using many coiled springs to provide a rebounding force which propels the jumper high into the air. In a trampoline, the fabric is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs which connect it to the frame. While the trampoline is an old invention which relied on crude and flawed designs, the modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen and Larry Griswold around 1934.1934 Acrostic (puzzle)An acrostic is a type of word puzzle, related somewhat to crossword puzzles, that uses an acrostic form with lettered clues and numbered blanks. The acrostic puzzle was invented in 1934 by Elizabeth Kingsley, first appearing in the March 31 edition of the Saturday Evening Post.1935 Richter magnitude scale The Richter magnitude scale, or local magnitude  scale, assigns a number to quantify the amount of seismic energy released by an earthquake. It is a base-10 logarithmic scale obtained by calculating the logarithm of the combined horizontal amplitude of the largest displacement from zero on a Wood–Anderson torsion seismometer output. Co-invented in 1935 by Charles Richter along with Beno Gutenberg of the California Institute of Technology, the Richter magnitude scale was firstly intended to be used only in a particular study area in California, and on seismograms recorded on a particular instrument, the Wood-Anderson torsion seismometer.1935 Black light A Black light or UV Light is a lamp emitting electromagnetic radiation that is almost exclusively in the soft ultraviolet range, and emits little visible light. The black light was invented by William H. Byler, in 1935.1935 Parking meter A parking meter is a device used to collect money in exchange for the right to park a vehicle in a particular place for a limited amount of time. The parking meter was invented by Carl C. Magee of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma in 1935. Magee also holds the patent for a ""coin controlled parking meter"", filed on May 13, 1935 and issued on May 24, 1938.1935 Surfboard fin The surfboard fin, or keel, is the part of the back of a surfboard that enters the water. Similar to a rudder on a boat the surfboard fin works to steer the board and provide stability. The surfboard fin prevents a surfer from uncontrollably spinning in circles while trying to ride a wave. The surfboard fin was invented by Tom Blake in 1935.1935 pH meter A pH meter is an electronic instrument used to measure the pH (acidity or alkalinity) of a liquid. In 1935, Arnold Orville Beckman invented the pH meter.1935 Gomco clamp A Gomco clamp, otherwise known as a Yellen clamp, is a specialized clamp for performing circumcisions on a human male's penis. y using a Gomco clampe, the time required is less than that by any other method, sutures are never used, no bleeding is encountered, and it leaves a clean-cut incision which heals perfectly in 36 hours with practically no chance of infection because the mucous membrane and skin are securely clamped together. The Gomco clamp was inented in 1935 by Hiram S. Yellen and Aaron Goldstein. The Gomco clamp was then market by Goldstein through his private company, the Goldstein Manufacturing Company and later patented in 1940.1936 Reed switchA reed switch is an electrical switch consisting of two ferromagnetic and specially shaped contact blades (reeds) positioned in a hermetically sealed glass tube with a gap between them and in a protective atmosphere. Operated by an applied magnetic field, reed switches are used as reed relays, automotive sensors, robotics sensors, security sensors and are found in many toys and games. The reed switch was invented in 1936 by W. B. Elwood at Bell Telephone Laboratories.1936 Phillips-head screwThe Phillips-head screw is a crosshead screw design lying in its self-centering property, useful on automated production lines that use power screwdrivers. The Phillips-head screw was invented and patented by Henry F. Phillips in 1936.1936 Stock car racingStock car racing is a form of automobile racing. Shorter ovals are called short tracks, unpaved short tracks are called dirt tracks, and longer ovals are known as superspeedways. On March 8, 1936, the first stock car race was held on the Daytona Beach Road Course, promoted by local racer Sig Haugdahl. The race was 78 laps (250 miles) long for street-legal family sedans sanctioned by the American Automobile Association (AAA) for cars built in 1935 and 1936. The city posted a $5000 purse with $1700 for the winner. In 1948, stock car racing became a regulated sport when Bill France, Sr. created NASCAR.1936 Programming languagesA programming language is a machine-readable artificial language. Programming languages can be used to create programs that specify the behavior of a machine, to express algorithms precisely, or as a mode of human communication. The first programming languages predate the modern computer. In mathematical logic and computer science, lambda calculus, also written as λ-calculus, is a formal system designed to investigate function definition, function application and recursion. It was invented by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s as part of an investigation into the foundations of mathematics, but has now emerged as a useful tool in the investigation of problems in computability, recursion theory, and as a fundamental basis and a modern paradigm to computer programming and software languages.1936 Compact fluorescent lampA compact fluorescent lamp is a fluorescent lamp designed to replace an incandescent lightbulb. Some CFL's fit into light fixtures formerly used for incandescent lamps and they are designed to produce the same amount of visible light found in incandescent light. CFLs generally use 70% less energy and have a longer rated life. In 1941, George Inman devised the first practical fluorescent lamp while working for General Electric. The key patent for this light source, U.S. patent #2,259,040 was filed by Inman on April 22, 1936 and issued to him on October 14, 1941. In 1976, Edward E. Hammer invented the first helical or spiraled compact fluorescent lamp, but due to the difficulty of the manufacturing process for coating the interior of the spiral glass tube, General Electric did not manufacture or sell the device. Other companies began manufacturing and selling the device in 1995.1936 Chair liftA chair lift is a type of aerial lift, which consists of a continuously circulating steel cable loop strung between two end terminals and usually over intermediate towers, carrying a series of chairs. They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas, but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly, in urban transport. James Curran, an engineer from the Union Pacific Railroad, invented and built the first chair lift in the world. Known as the Proctor Mountain Ski Lift, it was located in Sun Valley, Idaho.1936 Strain gaugeA strain gauge is a device used to measure the strain of an object. As the object is deformed, the foil is deformed, causing its electrical resistance to change. The strain gauge was invented in 1936 by Edward E. Simmons, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and re-invented in 1938 by Arthur C. Ruge, an earthquake specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.1936 Bass guitarThe bass guitar is a stringed instrument played primarily with the fingers or thumb (either by plucking, slapping, popping, tapping, or thumping), or by using a plectrum. The bass guitar is similar in appearance and construction to an electric guitar, but with a longer neck and scale length, and four, five, or six strings. In 1936, the Audiovox bass, the earliest electric solid-body bass guitar made out of walnut and neck-through construction, was invented by Paul Tutmarc of Seattle, Washington. Later in 1951, the bass guitar was perfected when Leo Fender introduced the precision bass, a fretted, solid-body instrument.1937 O-ring An O-ring, also known as a toric joint, is a mechanical gasket in the shape of a torus containing a loop of elastomer with a disc-shaped cross-section. It is designed to be seated in a groove and compressed during assembly between two or more parts, creating a seal at the interface. The O-ring was invented in 1937 by Danish-American machinist Niels Christensen.1937 Photosensitive glass Photosensitive glass is a clear glass in which microscopic metallic particles can be formed into a picture or image by exposure to short wave radiations such as ultraviolet light. Photosensitive glass was invented in November 1937 by S. Donald Stookey of Corning Glass Works.1937 Digital computer A digital computer is a device capable of solving problems by processing information on discrete form. It operates on data, including magnitudes, letters, and symbols that are expressed in binary form. While working at Bell Labs in November 1937, George Stibitz, who is internationally recognized as the father of the modern digital computer, built the world's first relay-based computer which calculated binary addition.1937 Shopping cartA shopping cart is a metal or plastic basket on wheels supplied by a shop, especially a supermarket, for use by customers inside the shop for transport of merchandise to the check-out counter during shopping. Often, customers are allowed to leave the carts in the parking lot, and store personnel return the carts to the shop. The first shopping cart was invented by Sylvan Goldman in 1937, owner of the Humpty Dumpty supermarket chain in Oklahoma City.1937 Sunglasses (polarized)Polarized sunglasses are protective eyewear which incorporate oscillated lenses shifting the sun's rays in the opposite direction. Polarized sunglasses were invented in 1937 by Edwin Land.1937 KlystronA klystron is a specialized linear-beam vacuum tube. Klystrons are used as amplifiers at microwave and radio frequencies to produce both low-power reference signals for superheterodyne radar receivers and to produce high-power carrier waves for communications and the driving force for modern particle accelerator. Russell and Sigurd Varian of Stanford University are generally considered to be the inventors. Their prototype was completed in August 1937.1937 Cyclamate Cyclamate is an artificial sweetener 30–50 times sweeter than sugar, making it the least potent of the commercially used artificial sweeteners. It was invented in 1937 by graduate student Michael Sveda at the University of Illinois.1938 Beach ballA beach ball is an inflatable ball for beach and water games. Their large size and light weight take little effort to propel; they travel very slowly and generally must be caught with two hands, making them ideal for lazy games and for children. Their lightness and size make them difficult to use in even moderate wind. The beach ball was invented in California by Jonathon DeLonge in 1938.1938 FiberglassThe technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers has been used for millennia. The use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent. The first commercial production of fiberglass was in 1936. In 1938, fiberglass was invented by Russell Games Slayter of Owens-Corning.1938 XerographyXerography, which means ""dry writing"" in Greek, is a process of making copies. Xerography makes copies without using ink. In this process, static electricity charges a lighted plate; a plastic powder is applied to the areas of the page to remain white. The photocopier was invented in 1938 by Chester Floyd Carlson who marketed his revolutionary device to about 20 companies before he could interest any. The Haloid Company, later called the Xerox Corporation, marketed it, and xerography eventually became common and inexpensive.1938 Nylon In 1938, a team of researchers working under Wallace H. Carothers at E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company invented a plastic that can be drawn into strong, silk-like fibers. Nylon soon became popular as a fabric for hosiery as well as industrial applications such as cordage.1938 Operant conditioning chamber Also known as a Skinner box, an operant conditioning chamber is a laboratory apparatus used in the experimental analysis of behavior to study animal behavior. The operant conditioning chamber was invented in 1938 by B. F. Skinner.1938 Soft serve ice creamNot to be confused with regular ice cream of the slow, churned type which was invented in China over two millennia ago, soft serve is a distinctive type of frozen dessert that is similar to, but much softer than, ice cream. In 1938, J.F. ""Grandpa"" McCullough and his son Alex co-invented soft serve ice cream, devising a new way to serve ice cream in its soft, creamy form that it takes before going into the deep freeze to make it scoopable. After Alex McCullough commissioned Harry Oltz in 1939 to design the first soft serve ice cream machine, similar to ones used for making frozen custard, the Dairy Queen franchise was founded when Sherb Noble opened the first store in 1940.1938 TeflonIn chemistry, polytetrafluoroethylene is a synthetic fluoropolymer which finds numerous applications. PTFE is best known by the DuPont brand name Teflon. PTFE was accidentally invented by Roy Plunkett of Kinetic Chemicals in 1938.1939 Yield signIn road transport, a yield sign or give way sign indicates that a vehicle driver must prepare to stop if necessary to let a driver on another approach proceed. However, there is no need to stop if his way is clear. A driver who stops has yielded his right of way to another. The yield sign, but not the yield traffic rule itself, was invented in 1939 by Tulsa police officer Clinton Riggs.1939 VU meterA VU meter is often included in analog circuit, audio equipment to display a signal level in Volume Units. It is intentionally a ""slow"" measurement, averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration to reflect the perceived loudness of the material. It was originally invented in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC for measuring and standardizing the levels of telephone lines. The instrument used to measure VU is called the volume indicator (VI) instrument. Most users ignore this and call it a VU meter.1939 Starting gate A starting gate, also known as starting stalls, is a machine used in the sports of thoroughbred horse and dog racing to ensure a fair start in a race. The starting gate was invented by Clay Puett of Chillicothe, Texas when it was used at Lansdowne Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for the first time on July 1, 1939. U.S. patent #2,232,675 was filed by Puett on August 7, 1939 and issued to him on February 18, 1941.1939 Twist tie A twist tie is a metal wire that is encased in a thin strip of paper or plastic and is used to tie the openings of bags, such as garbage bags or bread bags. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.1939 Automated teller machineAn automated teller machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunications device that provides the clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk or bank teller. ATMs are known by various other names including automatic banking machine, cash machine, and various regional variants derived from trademarks on ATM systems held by particular banks. Financial transcationssuch as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of accounts may be conducted at ATM's by inserting an ATM card. In 1939, Armenian-American inventor Luther George Simjian initially came up with the idea of creating a hole-in-the-wall machine that would allow customers to make financial transactions. The idea was met with a great deal of skepticism after Citicorp tested it. In later years and after Simjian filed 20 patents related to the device, the idea and the gradual usage of ATM's became more widespread around the world.1939 VocoderA vocoder, a portmanteau of the words voice and encoder, is an analysis and synthesis system, mostly used for speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder applies these control signals to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist Homer Dudley invented the Vocoder at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.1940 Fluxgate magnetometer A fluxgate magnetometer measures the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields. Fluxgate magnetometer sensors are manufactured in several geometries and recently have made significant improvements in noise performance, crossfield tolerance and power utilization. The fluxgate magnetometer was invented by Victor Vacquier in 1940 while working for Gulf Research in Pittsburgh.1941 Aerosol Bomb An Aerosol bomb is a hand-held container or dispenser from which an aerosol is released. Developed in 1941 by Lyle D. Goodhue and William N. Sullivan and patented in 1943.
  1941 Deodorant Deodorants are substances applied to the body to reduce body odor caused by the bacterial breakdown of perspiration. Jules Montenier holds a number of patents. Arguably, his January 28, 1941 patent for Astringent Preparation is his most famous which dealt with solving the problem of the excessive acidity of aluminum chloride, then and now the best working antiperspirant, by adding a soluble nitrile or a similar compound. This innovation found its way into ""Stopette"" deodorant spray, which Time Magazine called ""the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s"".1941 Acrylic fiber Acrylic fibers are synthetic fibers made from a polymer Polyacrylonitrile with an average molecular weight of ~100,000, about 1900 monomer units. To be called acrylic in the United States, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer. Typical comonomers are vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate. The Dupont Corporation invented the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name ""Orlon"".1941 Electric guitar (solid body) A solid body electric guitar, made up of hardwood with a lacquer coating, is an electric guitar that has no hollow internal cavity to accommodate vibration. There are no sound holes such as those used to amplify string vibrations in acoustic guitars. The sound that is audible in music featuring electric guitars is produced by pickups on the guitar that convert the string vibrations into an electrical signal, usually fed into an amplifier or a speaker. The solid body guitar was invented in 1941 by American recording artist Les Paul.1942 BazookaA bazooka is a shoulder-fired, man-portable recoilless rocket anti-tank weapon that features a solid rocket motor for propulsion, allowing for high explosive (HE) and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads to be delivered against armored vehicles, machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown grenade or mine. The bazooka was co-invented in February 1942 by Edward Uhl, then a lieutenant in the United States Army, and Colonel Leslie Skinner.1943 Magnetic proximity fuzeA magnetic proximity fuze is a type of proximity fuze that initiates a detonator in a piece of ordnance such as a land mine, naval mine, depth charge, or shell when the fuse's magnetic equilibrium is upset by a magnetic object such as a tank or a submarine. In 1943, Panayottis John Eliomarkakis of Philiadelphia filed U.S. patent #2,434,551 which was issued on January 13, 1948.1943 Modern Coal Burning Steam LocomotiveThis invention was only primarily used with steam locomotives that had booster valves or superchargers to heat the fire even hotter to produce extra power. The coal used was semi-bituminous and bituminous coal only inside the steam locomotives. Sadly, this invention lasted until 1960 when Diesel's fully replaced American railroads.1943 SlinkyA Slinky or ""Lazy Spring"" is a toy consisting of a helical spring that stretches and can bounce up and down. It can perform a number of tricks, including traveling down a flight of steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum. The Slinky was invented in 1943 by American engineer Richard T. James while working in his home laboratory to invent a set of springs that could be used to support sensitive instruments on board ships and stabilize them even in rough seas. When he once accidentally knocked one of his springs off a shelf, James saw that, rather than flopping in a heap onto the floor, the spring ""stepped"" in a series of arcs from the shelf, to a stack of books, to a tabletop, to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. In 1945, the James first exhibited his new toy at the Gimbels, a department store located in Philadelphia. He sold 400 Slinkys in 90 minutes which was the start of a sensation that continues to this day. 1945 Microwave ovenA microwave oven cooks or heats food by dielectric heating. Cooking food with microwaves was discovered by Percy Spencer on October 8, 1945, while building magnetrons for radar sets at Raytheon. Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar he had in his pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and realized what was happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg. In 1947, Raytheon under Percy Spencer demonstrated the world's first microwave oven built at the company which was called the ""Radarange"".1945 Cruise controlCruise control automatically controls the rate of motion of a motor vehicle. The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle of the car to maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named Ralph Teetor. His idea was born out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.1945 Block heater A block heater warms the engine of an automobile in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block heater may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line with one of the radiator or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.

"Creosote gall midge

Creosote gall midges are a species of gall-inducing flies in the Asphondylia auripila group (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). This group consists of 15 closely related species of flies which inhabit creosote bush (Zygophyllaceae: Larrea tridentata) sensu lato. They have partitioned the plant ecologically with different gall midge species inhabiting the leaves, stems, buds, and flowers of creosote bush. Each species induces a uniquely shaped gall but the insects are otherwise morphologically very similar and very difficult to tell apart.

Their life cycle begins when the female oviposits into the part of the plant which her species prefers, she inserts her egg along with a fungal spore from a mycangia (a small pocket to store fungal spores). A gall forms and the fungal mycelium grows to line the inside of the gall, when the egg hatches the developing larva feeds upon the fungus. Adult emergence is timed with periods of plant growth associated with winter, spring, or summer rain fall. In contrast to many other groups of plant-feeding insects (which form new species through changes to new host plants) the evolution of new species in the A. auripila group seems to be a result of colonizing new parts of the same plant and/or colonization of new seasons of plant growth.

List of species
The Asphondylia genus has over 60 described species.  Within the genus the creosote gall midge species form a species group, the A. auripila group.
Species described this far (by host-plant part) include:

 Asphondylia clavata – leaf gall
 Asphondylia pilosa – leaf gall
 Asphondylia villosa – leaf gall
 Asphondylia barbata – leaf gall
 Asphondylia digitata – leaf gall
 Asphondylia discalis – leaf gall

"Linotype machine

The Linotype machine ( ) was a ""line casting"" machine used in printing sold by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company and related  It was a hot metal typesetting system that cast blocks of metal type for individual uses. Linotype became one of the mainstay methods to set type, especially small-size body text, for newspapers, magazines, and posters from the late 19th century to the 1970s and 1980s, when it was largely replaced by phototypesetting and computer typesetting. The name of the machine comes from the fact that it produces an entire line of metal type at once, hence a line-o'-type, a significant improvement over the previous industry standard, i.e., manual, letter-by-letter typesetting using a composing stick and shallow subdivided trays, called ""cases"".

The linotype machine operator enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles matrices, which are molds for the letter forms, in a line. The assembled line is then cast as a single piece, called a slug, from molten type metal in a process known as hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine from which they came, to be reused later. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than original hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast glyph (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.

The machine revolutionized typesetting and with it especially newspaper publishing, making it possible for a relatively small number of operators to set type for many pages on a daily basis. Ottmar Mergenthaler invented the linotype in 1884.

History 

In 1876, a German clock maker, Ottmar Mergenthaler, who had emigrated to the United States in 1872, was approached by James O. Clephane and his associate Charles T. Moore, who sought a quicker way of publishing legal briefs. By 1884 he conceived the idea of assembling metallic letter molds, called matrices, and casting molten metal into them, all within a single machine. His first attempt proved the idea feasible, and a new company was formed. Improving his invention, Mergenthaler further developed his idea of an independent matrix machine. In July, 1886, the first commercially used Linotype was installed in the printing office of the New York Tribune. Here it was immediately used on the daily paper and a large book. The book, the first ever composed with the new Linotype method, was titled, The Tribune Book of Open-Air Sports.

Initially, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company was the only company producing linecasting machines, but in time, other companies would begin manufacturing. The Intertype Company produced the Intertype, a machine closely resembling the Linotype, and using the same matrices as the Linotype, started production around 1914. Where Mergenthaler prided themselves on intricately formed cast-iron parts on their machine, Intertype machined many of their similar parts from steel and aluminum.

Major newspaper publishers retired Linotype and similar ""hot metal"" typesetting machines during the 1970s and 1980s, replacing them with phototypesetting equipment and later computerized typesetting and page composition systems. , the last-known newspaper still using linotype in the United States, and possibly the world, is The Saguache Crescent.

Overview 

The linotype machine consists of four major sections:

 Magazine
 Keyboard
 Casting mechanism
 Distribution mechanism

The operator interacts with the machine via the keyboard, composing lines of text. The other sections are automatic; they start as soon as a line is completely composed.

Some linotype machines included a paper tape reader. This allowed the text to be typeset to be supplied over a telegraph line (TeleTypeSetter). It also allowed for several tape perforator operators to prepare paper tape to be processed by a single linotype machine, essentially decoupling the typing speed of the operators from the operating speed of the linotype machine.

Design

Matrices 

Each matrix contains the letter form for a single character of a font of type; i.e., a particular type design in a particular size. The letter form is engraved into one side of the matrix. For sizes up to 14 points, and in some matrices of size 16 to 24 points, the matrix has two letter forms on it, the normal and auxiliary positions. The normal position has the upright (Roman) form of a given character, and on the auxiliary, the slanted (Italic) form of that character will be used, but this can also be the boldface form or even a different font entirely. The machine operator can select which of the two will be cast by operating the auxiliary rail of the assembler, or, when setting entire lines of italics, by using the flap, which is a piece that can be turned under a portion of the first elevator column. This is the origin of the old typesetting terms upper rail for italic and lower rail for Roman characters. These terms have persisted in phototypesetting technology even though the mechanics of the auxiliary rail do not exist there. The character on a Linotype matrix, when viewed, is not inverted as a letter for conventional movable type would be, and the letter is incised below the surface rather than raised above it. This is because the matrix is not used directly to print onto the paper—rather, it is used as part of a mold from which a metal slug will be cast. The slug has its features reversed: therefore, the matrix does not.

Magazine section 

The magazine section is the part of the machine where the matrices are held when not in use, and released as the operator touches keys on the keyboard. The magazine is a flat box with vertical separators that form ""channels"", one channel for each character in the font. Most main magazines have 90 channels, but those for larger fonts carried only 72 or even 55 channels. The auxiliary magazines used on some machines typically contained 34 channels or, for a magazine carrying larger fonts, 28 channels.

The magazine holds a particular font of type; i.e., a particular type design in a particular size. If a different size or style was needed, the operator would switch to a different magazine. Many models of the Linotype machine could keep several magazines (as many as four) available at a time. In some of these, the operator could shift to a different magazine by raising or lowering the stack of magazines with a crank. Such machines would not allow mixing fonts within a single line. Others, such as the Models 25 and 26 allowed arbitrary mixing of text from two magazines within the same line, and the Model 9 extended this capability to mixing from up to four magazines within a single line.

Escapement 
In a linotype machine, the term escapements refers to the mechanisms at the bottom of the magazine that release matrices one at a time as keys are pressed on the keyboard. There is an escapement for each channel in the magazine.

Maintenance and lubrication 

To keep the matrices circulating smoothly throughout the machine, it is necessary that oil not be allowed anywhere near the matrix path. If oil is found in the matrix's path (due to careless maintenance or over-lubrication of nearby parts), it combines with dust, forming a gummy substance that is eventually deposited in the magazine by the matrices. The most common result is that the matrix will not be released from the magazine at its usual speed, and almost always results in a letter or two arriving out of sequence in the assembler — a ""matrix transposition"". When these machines were in heavy use, it was not uncommon for an operator to set type at the rate of over 4,000 ems per hour, with the fastest operators being able to exceed 10,000 ems per hour (approximately 10 to 30 words per minute in today's units) so careful lubrication and regular cleaning were essential to keep these machines operating at their full potential.

Keyboard and composing section 

In the composing section, the operator enters the text for a line on the keyboard. Each keystroke releases a matrix from the magazine mounted above the keyboard. The matrix travels through channels to the assembler where the matrices are lined up side by side in the order they were released.

When a space is needed, the operator touches the spaceband lever just to the left of the keyboard. This releases a spaceband from the spaceband box. Spacebands are stored separately from the matrices because they are too big to fit in the magazine.

Once enough text has been entered for the line, the operator depresses the casting lever mounted on the front right corner of the keyboard. This lifts the completed line in the assembler up between two fingers in the ""delivery channel"", simultaneously tripping the catch holding it in position. The spring-operated delivery channel then transports the line into the casting section of the machine, and engages the clutch that drives the casting section and the subsequent transfer into the distribution section. The operator is now finished with the line; the remaining processing is automatic. While the line is being cast, the operator can continue entering text for the next line.

Keyboard 

The keyboard has 90 keys. The usual arrangement is that black keys on the left were for small letters, white keys on the right were for capital letters, and blue keys in the center for numbers, punctuation marks, spaces, small caps and other items. There is no shift key of the kind found on typewriters.

The arrangement of letters corresponds roughly to letter frequency, with the most frequently used letters on the left. The first two columns of keys are: e, t, a, o, i, n; and s, h, r, d, l, u. A Linotype operator would often deal with a typing error by running the fingers down these two rows, thus filling out the line with the nonsense words etaoin shrdlu. This is known as a ""run down"". It is often quicker to cast a bad slug than to hand-correct the line within the assembler. The slug with the run down is removed once it has been cast, or by the proofreader.

The linotype keyboard has the same alphabet arrangement given twice, once for lower-case letters, the keys in black, on the left side of the keyboard, and once for upper-case letters, the keys in white, located on the right side of the keyboard. The blue keys in the middle are punctuation, digits, small capital letters and fixed-width spaces. In proper keyboard operation, an experienced operator's left hand operates only the spaceband key and the left column of keys. The operator's right hand strokes the remaining keys on the entire keyboard.

The keys of the keyboard are connected by vertical pushrods to the escapements. When a key is pressed, the corresponding escapement is actuated, which releases a matrix from the magazine. With one exception, each key corresponds directly to a channel in the standard (90 channel) magazine. The one exception is the lower-case letter e: that letter is used so often that the 90 channel magazine actually has 91 channels, with two channels (the leftmost two) both used for the letter e. Similarly, the 72 channel magazine actually has 73 channels, with the leftmost two being used for lower-case e. Alternate lines release matrices alternately from the two e channels in the magazine.

On machines that support multiple magazines, there is a shifting mechanism that controls which magazine is currently connected to the keyboard. In most machines, this is done by raising or lowering the stack of magazines.

Spaceband box 

In justified text, the spaces are not fixed width; they expand to make all lines equal in width. In linotype machines this is done by spacebands. A spaceband consists of two wedges, one similar in size and shape to a type matrix, one with a long tail. The wide part of the wedge is at the bottom of the tail, so pushing the tail up expands the spaceband.

Due to their size, spacebands are not held in the magazine, but in a spaceband box and released one at a time by pressing the spaceband lever at the left edge of the keyboard.

Assembler 
Matrices released from the magazine, and spacebands released from the spaceband box, drop down into the assembler. This is a rail that holds the matrices and spacebands, with a jaw on the left end set to the desired line width. When the operator judges that the line is close enough to full, he raises the casting lever on the bottom of the keyboard to send the line to the casting section of the linotype machine. The remaining processing for that line is automatic; as soon as the finished line has been transferred to the casting section, the operator can begin composing the next line of text.

Casting section 
The casting section of the machine operated intermittently, when triggered by the operator at the completion of a line.   The full casting cycle time was less than nine seconds.  Motive power for the casting section came from a clutch-operated drive running large cams (the keyboard and distributor sections ran all the time, since distribution may take much longer; however, the front part of the distributor completed its job before the next line of matrices was distributed). The construction of the machine was such that both the return of the former line to the magazine and the composition of the next line could occur while the current line was being cast, enabling very high productivity.

Older machines typically had a 1/3 hp 850 or 1140 revolution per minute motor geared to the main clutch wheel, the inner shaft engaging this wheel while the casting cycle was in operation.  An external leather belt on this wheel ran a second jackshaft, which powered the distributor and keyboard matrix conveyor and escapements through additional belting off this shaft.  Gas fired pots, such as in the illustration below, were most common in the earlier years, with the pot being thermostatically controlled (high flame when under temperature and low flame when up to temperature), and then a second smaller burner for the mouth and throat heating, with the more modern installations running on 1500 watt electric pots with an initially rheostat controlled mouth and throat heaters (several hundred watts on the electric models).  The temperature was precisely adjusted to keep the lead and tin type metal liquified just prior to being cast.  Newer machines, and the larger machines above 36 EM Matrix size typically used the more standardized 1/2 horsepower motor after v-belts came into common use in the 1930s.  The large machines also had the so-called 'double pot', with either larger gas burners, or else 2250 watt pot heaters and larger mouth and throat heaters.  The most modern Linotypes had the mouth and throat heaters thermostatically controlled, an improvement over the manual rheostat adjustment, or gas flame adjustment.
The Linotype company would even supply kerosene heaters and line-shaft operated machines, in locales without electricity.

The casting section receives completed lines from the assembler, and uses these to cast the type slugs that are the product of the linotype machine. The casting section is automatic: once it is activated by the operator sending a completed line by raising the casting lever, a series of cams and levers move the matrices through the casting section and control the sequence of steps that produce the slug.

The casting material is an alloy of lead (85%), antimony (11%), and tin (4%), and produces a one-piece casting slug capable of 300,000 impressions before the casting begins to develop deformities and imperfections, and the type must be cast again.

The continuous heating of the molten alloy causes the tin and antimony in the mixture to rise to the top and oxidize along with other impurities into a substance called ""dross"" which has to be skimmed off. Excessive dross formation leads to the alloy softening as the proportion of lead increases. The mixture must then be assayed and tin and antimony added back (in the form of a specially proportioned alloy) to restore the original strength and properties of the alloy.

Justification 

From the assembler, the assembled line moves via the first elevator to the justification vise. The vise has two jaws (1 and 2 in the illustration) which are set to the desired line width. The spacebands are now expanded to justify the line. When the line is justified, the matrices fit tightly between the vise jaws, forming a tight seal which will prevent the molten type metal from escaping when the line is cast.

Justification is done by a spring-loaded ram (5) which raises the tails of the spacebands, unless the machine was equipped with a Star Parts automatic hydraulic quadding attachment or Linotype hydraquadder.

If the operator did not assemble enough characters, the line will not justify correctly: even with the spacebands expanded all the way, the matrices are not tight. A safety mechanism in the justification vise detects this and blocks the casting operation. Without such a mechanism, the result would be a squirt of molten type metal spraying out through the gaps between the matrices, creating a time-consuming mess and a possible hazard to the operator. If a squirt did occur, it was generally up to the operator to grab the hell bucket and catch the flowing lead. It was so called because the bucket would often ""go to hell"", or melt, while holding the molten lead that was still extremely hot. Also, in conjunction with possible hazards facing an operator, toxic lead fumes were possible, as they were the result of melting the lead ingots for casting.

Mold disk and crucible 
The justification vise holds the assembled line against the face of the mold disk. The mold disk has rectangular openings which correspond to the line length and point thickness of the slugs (cast lines) to be made. Mold liners fit into these openings for specific slug dimensions. The maximum line length of the typical linecaster is 30 picas. A less common variant was fitted with 42 pica molds, though these are now rare to non-existent.

Directly behind the mold disk is the crucible, which contains molten type metal at an optimal 535°. At the moment before casting, the mold disk moves forward on its slide. Studs in the mold disc engage with blocks on the vise so that the mold disc seats gently, yet tightly and squarely against the line of matrices held in the first elevator jaws and between the vise jaws. The vise jaws compress the line of matrices so molten metal is prevented from squeezing between the mats on cast. The crucible tilts forward, forcing the mouthpiece tightly against the back of the mold. The plunger in the well of the crucible quickly descends, forcing the molten metal up the crucible throat and injecting it into the mold cavity through the array of orifices in the mouthpiece. The jets of molten metal first contact against the casting face of the matrices, and then fills the mold cavity to provide a solid slug body. These have character shapes punched into them, so the result is a cast slug with the character shapes of the line on its top face. The mold disk is sometimes water-cooled, and often air-cooled with a blower, to carry away the heat of the molten type metal and allow the cast slugs to solidify quickly.

When casting is complete, the plunger is drawn upward, pulling the metal back down the throat from the mouthpiece. The pot pulls backward away from the mold. The mold disk retracts from the vise studs which held it in perfect relation to the mold, thus breaking the slug away from the matrices. The mold disc then rotates counter-clockwise. In its travel, the slug base is trimmed by the back knife for height to paper (.918"") and then returns to its neutral position in front of the ejector blades  and aligned with the knife block assembly a pair of honed knives with a fixed knife, and a knife which is set to the point thickness of the mold liners being cast with. The knives are set to dead parallel. The fixed knife on the left bears against the smooth side of the slug (the mold body face of the slug) as it brushes next to it, and the right knife trims the ribs on the slug (the mold cap face of the slug). The disk stops when the mold is vertical, on the right, directly in front of the ejector.

The ejector is a stacked series of narrow blades that push the completed slug from the mold aperture in the mold disk. The blades are narrow enough to pass through a mold set to 6-points in thickness with .004"" clearance between the fixed mold face and the left side of the blades. The blades are each 2 picas in width and the number of blades engaged on ejection are set based on the line length being cast. All blades are engaged for a 30 pica slug, fewer are engaged as the measure of the slug body is narrowed by the use of progerssively longer mold liners. This prevents the ejector blades from striking the back of a mold liner on narrow slugs. As the slug is pushed from the mold, the slug passes a set of knife edges in the knife block, which trims off any small irregularities in the casting and produces a slug of exactly the desired point thickness. From there, the slug drops into the galley tray which holds the lines in the order in which they were cast.

Distribution mechanism 

The most significant innovation in the linotype machine was that it automated the distribution step; i.e., returning the matrices and space bands back to the correct place in their respective magazines. This is done by the distributor.

After casting is completed, the matrices are pushed to the second elevator which raises them to the distributor at the top of the magazine. The space bands are separated out at this point and are returned to the spaceband box.

The matrices have a pattern of teeth at the top, by which they hang from the distributor bar. Some of the teeth are cut away; which pattern of teeth is cut away depends on the character on the matrix; i.e., which channel in the magazine it belongs in. Similarly, teeth are cut away along portions of the distributor bar. The bar on the elevator has all teeth, so it will hold any matrix (but not the space bands, which have no teeth at all).

Distributor bar and matrix teeth coding 

As the matrices are carried along the distributor bar by the distributor screws, they will hang on only so long as there are teeth to hold them. As soon as the matrix reaches the point where each of its teeth corresponds to a cut-away tooth on the distributor bar, it is no longer supported and will drop into the matrix channel below that point.

The pattern of teeth is a 7-bit binary code, with the innermost pair of teeth at the bottom of the notch being the most significant bit. The codes count up from the left side of the main magazine.  Code 0 (no teeth) is for spacebands, which are not carried up to the distributor. Code 1 is skipped (no reason for this is given in the Linotype manual). Codes 2 through 92 are for the 91-channel main magazine, and the codes above that are for the auxiliary magazine, if one is installed on the machine. The widest auxiliary magazine has 34 channels, so its rightmost channel is code 125. Code 126 is unused while code 127 is used for pi matrices (described below).

Pi matrices 

In typesetting, it is sometimes necessary to use characters that are uncommon or obscure enough that it does not make sense to assign them to a magazine channel. These characters are referred to as pi characters or sorts (""pi"" in this case refers to an obscure printer's term relating to loose or spilled type). Footnote marks, rarely used fractions, and mathematical symbols are examples of pi characters. In the linotype machine, a pi matrix has all teeth present (code 127, no teeth cut away) so it will not drop from the distributor bar and will not be released into either the main or the auxiliary magazine. Instead, it travels all the way to the end and into the flexible metal tube called the pi chute and is then lined up in the sorts stacker, available for further use.

"Dependent source

In the theory of electrical networks, a dependent source  is a voltage source or a current source whose value depends on a voltage or current elsewhere in the network.

Dependent sources are useful, for example, in modelling the behavior of amplifiers. A bipolar junction transistor can be modelled as a dependent current source whose magnitude depends on the magnitude of the current fed into its controlling base terminal. An operational amplifier can be described as a voltage source dependent on the differential input voltage between its input terminals. Practical circuit elements have properties such as finite power capacity, voltage, current, or frequency limits that mean an ideal source is only an approximate model. Accurate modelling of practical devices requires using several idealized elements in combination.

Classification

Dependent sources can be classified as follows:

 Voltage-controlled voltage source: The source delivers the voltage as per the voltage of the dependent element. 
 Voltage-controlled current source: The source delivers the current as per the voltage of the dependent element. 
 Current-controlled current source: The source delivers the current as per the current of the dependent element. 
 Current-controlled voltage source: The source delivers the voltage as per the current of the dependent element. 

Dependent sources are not necessarily linear. For example, MOSFET switches can be modeled as a voltage-controlled current source when 
 and .

However, the relationship between the current flowing through it and  is approximately:

In this case, the current is not linear to , but rather approximately proportional to the square of .

As for the case of linear dependent sources, the proportionality constant between dependent and independent variables is dimensionless if they are both currents (or both voltages).  A voltage controlled by a current has a proportionality factor expressed in units of resistance (ohms), and this constant is sometimes called ""transresistance"".  A current controlled by a voltage has the units of conductance (siemens), and is called ""transconductance"".  Transconductance is a commonly used specification for measuring the performance of field effect transistors and vacuum tubes.

"List of Uchu Sentai Kyuranger characters

is a Japanese tokusatsu drama and the 41st in the Super Sentai series. Taking place in the distant future of a parallel universe, the series follows twelve individuals chosen by the constellations to fight Jark Matter, an evil organization that has taken over the galaxy.

Kyurangers

The Kyurangers are a team of warriors composed of humanoids, androids, and some with animal-like features from different star systems whose powers derive from magical stones known as the Kyutamas. They are part of the , an insurrection army fighting to liberate the universe from the evil Jark Matter syndicate. They travel around space in a spaceship known as the , whose design pays homage to the homonymous character from Greek mythology and is named after an old ally of Tsurugi's. After the Orion is destroyed, they obtain a second, stronger ship known as the Battle Orion Ship. All Kyurangers are based on the Twelve Olympians (Dii Consentes).

Each Kyuranger carries a , a gauntlet-like sidearm they use to both transform and access the powers of their Kyutama, such as when they perform the  finisher (which also has two variations:  with the first 11 Kyurangers and  with all 12 Kyurangers), and a , which is composed of three separate parts (handle, lower blade, and upper blade). Each is assembled into one of nine different modes, according to the user's fighting style, as their main weapon and can be used to perform the  finisher. They each possess a  on their belts for them to access their Skill Kyutamas.

Once the Kyurangers have been declared enemies of Jark Matter, the Shogunate establishes a bounty of 10.000.000  for each member. Due to the excess number of team members and to preserve the energy of the Kyutamas, only a limited number of Kyurangers are permitted to be deployed initially for each mission after being randomly chosen using a bingo tumbler-like device called the . The others remain on standby to assist them if needed.

Once all nine Kyurangers have been assembled, the team decides to start their counterattack on Jark Matter by liberating Earth which is being tightly guarded by them for a yet unexplained reason. They later add three other members, one being their commander and two others from Earth. After obtaining the Tokei Kyutama, the team splits into two factions; one stays in the present to rescue one of their companions who has turned evil, while the other travels to the past to learn more about Jark Matter's leader, Don Armage. After they reunite again in the present, the Kyurangers depart from Earth to confront Don Armage on Planet Southern Cross in the Crux System. There they stop his Planedium Bomb from destroying the entire universe. They later return to Earth to confront and defeat Don Armage once and for all.

Don Armage
 is the leader, or , of Jark Matter who was born from the collective despair of all life in the universe. Revealing himself when Tsurugi united the universe 300 years earlier, Armage established Jark Matter to destroy everything Tsurugi had built to thrive on the resulting misery, increase his power, and become a god. Although seemingly killed by Tsurugi, with one of his numerous clones destroyed by a time-displaced Shishi Red Orion, Armage survived by possessing Cuervo and retaliates by conquering Earth along with erasing records of Tsurugi and his comrades' achievements. Leading Jark Matter for the next 333 years, overseeing his campaign through holograms from  in the Crux System, later revealed to be a test site for his doomsday device, Armage has his forces drain Planedium from conquered planets to create the universally destructive Planedium Bomb which he intends to use on Earth. After being expelled from Cuervo, Armage takes Tsurugi as his new host to become an immortal able to harness  energy, until the other Kyurangers take measures to rescue him. Once forced out of Tsurugi and fully revealed in his natural form, Armage converts every life form in the universe besides himself and the Kyurangers into Planedium energy which he absorbs to assume a new form while calling himself the universe incarnate. But as Armage battles the Kyurangers, they manage to reach the despair-ridden people who help them before Armage is forced to release them all. A fatally wounded Armage makes a final attempt at cheating death by implanting the fragment of himself inside Lucky's body to eventually resurrect, but it backfires and the fragment is forced back into Armage's body as the Kyurangers finish him off.

Despite appearing in holograms, Armage is able to transmit his energy for attacks or transform others into monsters by imparting a fragment of his essence into them. But as the Kyurangers learned when they faced his clones in the past, Armage is extremely powerful enough to easily overwhelm his opponents by launching massive blasts of dark energy. A small bullet that he fired was enough to penetrate a Kyuranger suit and would have succeeded in killing Lucky had Tsurugi not interfered. In combat, Armage and his clones wield the  and later the . Armage and his clones are also capable of possessing other beings and use their innate abilities as his own, as was the case with Hoshi Minato, Aslan, Cuervo, and Tsurugi.

In the final battle against Don Armage, Cuervo sacrificed himself to shield Tsurugi so his friend could deal what they thought would be the deathblow on the tyrant. But what Tsurugi did not know was that Cuervo sold his soul to the surviving Armage to live, resulting in his rebirth as Armage's thrall . As Jark Matter begins their final experiment on Dark Planedium, having revealed his survival to Tsurugi on Southern Cross, Cuervo reveals himself to the Kyurangers and that he subverted Armage's will. Cuervo reveals his intent to allow Armage's goal to have the universe destroyed as an act of mercy so it can be recreated as a utopia, only for Armage to be extracted from him before Tsurgi lands the deathblow.

As one of the 88 legendary saviors, Cuervo's main weapons are a pair of sai. When under the possession of Don Armage, becoming Tsurugi's equal in combat, Don Cuervo wields a pair of  swords.

"Wheel of the Year

The Wheel of the Year is an annual cycle of seasonal festivals, observed by many modern Pagans, consisting of the year's chief solar events (solstices and equinoxes) and the midpoints between them.  While names for each festival vary among diverse pagan traditions, syncretic treatments often refer to the four solar events as ""quarter days"" and the four midpoint events as ""cross-quarter days"", particularly in Wicca.  Differing sects of modern Paganism also vary regarding the precise timing of each celebration, based on distinctions such as lunar phase and geographic hemisphere.

Observing the cycle of the seasons has been important to many people, both ancient and modern. Contemporary Pagan festivals that rely on the Wheel are based to varying degrees on folk traditions, regardless of actual historical pagan practices.  Among Wiccans, each festival is also referred to as a sabbat (), based on Gerald Gardner's claim that the term was passed down from the Middle Ages, when the terminology for Jewish Shabbat was commingled with that of other heretical celebrations.  Contemporary conceptions of the Wheel of the Year calendar were largely influenced by mid-20th century British Paganism.

Origins

Historical and archaeological evidence suggests ancient pagan and polytheist peoples varied in their cultural observations; Anglo-Saxons celebrated the solstices and equinoxes, while Celts celebrated the seasonal divisions with various fire festivals. In the 10th century Cormac Mac Cárthaigh wrote about ""four great fires...lighted up on the four great festivals of the Druids...in February, May, August, and November."" 

The contemporary Neopagan festival cycle, prior to being known as the Wheel of the Year, was influenced by works such as The Golden Bough by James George Frazer (1890) and The Witch-Cult in Western Europe (1921) by Margaret Murray.  Frazer claimed that Beltane (the beginning of summer) and Samhain (the beginning of winter) were the most important of the four Gaelic festivals mentioned by Cormac.  Murray used records from early modern witch trials, as well as the folklore surrounding European witchcraft, in an attempt to identify the festivals celebrated by a supposedly widespread underground pagan religion that had survived into the early modern period.  Murray reports a 1661 trial record from Forfar, Scotland, where the accused witch (Issobell Smyth) is connected with meetings held ""every quarter at Candlemas, Rud−day, Lambemas, and Hallomas."" In The White Goddess (1948) Robert Graves claimed that, despite Christianization, the importance of agricultural and social cycles had preserved the ""continuity of the ancient British festal system"" consisting of eight holidays: ""English social life was based on agriculture, grazing, and hunting"" implicit in ""the popular celebration of the festivals now known as Candlemas, Lady Day, May Day, Midsummer Day, Lammas, Michaelmas, All-Hallowe'en, and Christmas; it was also secretly preserved as religious doctrine in the covens of the anti-Christian witch-cult."" 

By the late 1950s the Bricket Wood coven led by Gerald Gardner and the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids led by Ross Nichols had both adopted eight-fold ritual calendars, in order to hold more frequent celebrations. Popular legend holds that Gardner and Nichols developed the calendar during a naturist retreat, where Gardner argued for a celebration of the solstices and equinoxes while Nichols argued for a celebration of the four Celtic fire festivals, and combined the two ideas into a single festival cycle. Though this coordination eventually had the benefit of more closely aligning celebrations between the two early Neopagan groups, Gardner's first published writings omit any mention of the solstices and equinoxes, focusing exclusively on the fire festivals. Gardner initially referred to these as ""May eve, August eve, November eve (Hallowe'en), and February eve."" Gardner further identified these modern witch festivals with the Gaelic fire festivals Beltene, Lugnasadh, Samhuin, and Brigid. By the mid-1960s, the phrase Wheel of the Year had been coined to describe the yearly cycle of witches' holidays.

Aidan Kelly gave names to the summer solstice (Litha) and equinox holidays (Ostara and Mabon) of Wicca in 1974, and these were popularized by Timothy Zell through his magazine Green Egg. Popularization of these names happened gradually; in her 1978 book Witchcraft For Tomorrow influential Wiccan Doreen Valiente did not use Kelly's names, instead simply identifying the solstices and equinoxes (""Lesser Sabbats"") by their seasons. Valiente identified the four ""Greater Sabbats"", or fire festivals, by the names Candlemas, May Eve, Lammas, and Hallowe'en, though she also identified their Irish counterparts as Imbolc, Beltane, Lughnassadh, and Samhain.

Due to early Wicca's influence on Modern Paganism and the syncretic adoption of Anglo-Saxon and Celtic motifs, the most commonly used English festival names for the Wheel of the Year tend to be the Celtic ones introduced by Gardner and the mostly Germanic-derived names introduced by Kelly, even when the celebrations are not based on those cultures. The American Ásatrú movement has adopted, over time, a calendar in which the Heathen major holidays figure alongside many Days of Remembrance which celebrate heroes of the Edda and the Sagas, figures of Germanic history, and the Viking Leif Ericson, who explored and settled Vinland (North America). These festivals are not, however, as evenly distributed throughout the year as in Wicca and other Heathen denominations.

Festivals

In many traditions of modern Pagan cosmology, all things are considered to be cyclical, with time as a perpetual cycle of growth and retreat tied to the Sun's annual death and rebirth. This cycle is also viewed as a micro- and macrocosm of other life cycles in an immeasurable series of cycles composing the Universe. The days that fall on the landmarks of the yearly cycle traditionally mark the beginnings and middles of the four seasons. They are regarded with significance and host to major communal festivals. These eight festivals are the most common times for community celebrations.

While the ""major"" festivals are usually the quarter and cross-quarter days, other festivals are also celebrated throughout the year, especially among the non-Wiccan traditions such as those of polytheistic reconstructionism and other ethnic traditions.

In Wiccan and Wicca-influenced traditions, the festivals, being tied to solar movements, have generally been steeped in solar mythology and symbolism, centered on the life cycles of the sun. Similarly, the Wiccan esbats are traditionally tied to the lunar cycles. Together, they represent the most common celebrations in Wiccan-influenced forms of Neopaganism, especially in contemporary Witchcraft groups.

Winter Solstice (Yule)

Midwinter, known commonly as Yule or within modern Druid traditions as Alban Arthan, has been recognised as a significant turning point in the yearly cycle since the late Stone Age. The ancient megalithic sites of Newgrange and Stonehenge, carefully aligned with the solstice sunrise and sunset, exemplify this. The reversal of the Sun's ebbing presence in the sky symbolizes the rebirth of the solar god and presages the return of fertile seasons. From Germanic to Roman tradition, this is the most important time of celebration.

Practices vary, but sacrifice offerings, feasting, and gift giving are common elements of Midwinter festivities. Bringing sprigs and wreaths of evergreenery (such as holly, ivy, mistletoe, yew, and pine) into the home and tree decorating are also common during this time.

In Roman traditions additional festivities take place during the six days leading up to Midwinter.

Imbolc (Candlemas)

The cross-quarter day following Midwinter falls on the first of February and traditionally marks the first stirrings of spring. It aligns with the contemporary observance of Groundhog Day. It is time for purification and spring cleaning in anticipation of the year's new life. In Rome, it was historically a shepherd's holiday, while the Celts associated it with the onset of ewes' lactation, prior to birthing the spring lambs.

For Celtic pagans, the festival is dedicated to the goddess Brigid, daughter of The Dagda and one of the Tuatha Dé Danann.

Among Reclaiming tradition Witches, this is the traditional time for pledges and rededications for the coming year and for initiation among Dianic Wiccans.

Spring Equinox (Ostara)

Derived from a reconstruction produced by linguist Jacob Grimm of an Old High German form of the Old English goddess name Ēostre, Ostara marks the vernal equinox in some modern Pagan traditions.

Known as Alban Eilir, meaning Light of the Earth, to modern Druid traditions, this holiday is the second of three spring celebrations (the midpoint between Imbolc and Beltane), during which light and darkness are again in balance, with light on the rise. It is a time of new beginnings and of life emerging further from the grips of winter.

Beltane (May Eve)

Traditionally the first day of summer in Ireland, in Rome the earliest celebrations appeared in pre-Christian times with the festival of Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers, and the Walpurgisnacht celebrations of the Germanic countries.

Since the Christianisation of Europe, a more secular version of the festival has continued in Europe and America, commonly referred to as May Day. In this form, it is well known for maypole dancing and the crowning of the Queen of the May.

Celebrated by many pagan traditions, among modern Druids this festival recognizes the power of life in its fullness, the greening of the world, youthfulness and flourishing.

Summer Solstice (Litha)

Midsummer is one of the four solar holidays and is considered the turning point at which summer reaches its height and the sun shines longest. Among the Wiccan sabbats, Midsummer is preceded by Beltane, and followed by Lammas or Lughnasadh.

Some Wiccan traditions call the festival Litha, a name occurring in Bede's The Reckoning of Time (, 8th century), which preserves a list of the (then-obsolete) Anglo-Saxon names for the twelve months.  (first or preceding ) roughly corresponds to June in the Gregorian calendar, and  (following ) to July. Bede writes that ""Litha means gentle or navigable, because in both these months the calm breezes are gentle and they were wont to sail upon the smooth sea"".

Modern Druids celebrate this festival as Alban Hefin, ""Light of Summer."" The sun in its greatest strength is greeted and celebrated on this holiday. While it is the time of greatest strength of the solar current, it also marks a turning point, for the sun also begins its time of decline as the wheel of the year turns. Arguably the most important festival of the Druid traditions, due to the great focus on the sun and its light as a symbol of divine inspiration. Druid groups frequently celebrate this event at Stonehenge.

Lughnasadh (Lammas)

Lammas or Lughnasadh () is the first of the three Wiccan harvest festivals, the other two being the autumnal equinox (or Mabon) and Samhain. Wiccans mark the holiday by baking a figure of the god in bread and eating it, to symbolise the sanctity and importance of the harvest. Celebrations vary, as not all Pagans are Wiccans. The Irish name Lughnasadh is used in some traditions to designate this holiday. Wiccan celebrations of this holiday are neither generally based on Celtic culture nor centered on the Celtic deity Lugh. This name seems to have been a late adoption among Wiccans. In early versions of Wiccan literature the festival is referred to as August Eve.

The name Lammas (contraction of loaf mass) implies it is an agrarian-based festival and feast of thanksgiving for grain and bread, which symbolises the first fruits of the harvest. Christian festivals may incorporate elements from the Pagan Ritual.

Autumn Equinox (Mabon)

The holiday of the autumnal equinox, Harvest Home, Mabon, the Feast of the Ingathering,  or  (in Neo-Druid traditions), is a modern Pagan ritual of thanksgiving for the fruits of the earth and a recognition of the need to share them to secure the blessings of the Goddess and the God during the coming winter months. The name Mabon was coined by Aidan Kelly around 1970 as a reference to , a character from Welsh mythology. Among the sabbats, it is the second of the three Pagan harvest festivals, preceded by Lammas / Lughnasadh and followed by Samhain.

Samhain (Hallowe'en)

Samhain () is considered by Wiccans to be one of the four Greater Sabbats. Samhain is considered by some as a time to celebrate the lives of those who have passed on, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones who have died. Aligned with the contemporary observance of Halloween and Day of the Dead. In some rituals the spirits of the departed are invited to attend the festivities. It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the wheel by the festival of Beltane, which is celebrated as a festival of light and fertility.

Many Pagans believe that at Samhain the veil between this world and the afterlife is at its thinnest point of the whole year, making it easier to communicate with those who have left this world.

Minor festivals
In addition to the eight major holidays common to most modern Pagans, there are a number of minor holidays during the year to commemorate various events.

Germanic

Some of the holidays listed in the ""Runic Era Calender"" of the Ásatrú Alliance:
Vali's Blot, celebration dedicated to the god Váli and to love — 14 February
Feast of the Einherjar, celebration to honor kin who died in battle — 11 November
Ancestors' Blot, celebration of one's own ancestry or the common ancestors of a Germanic ethnicity — 11 November
Yggdrasil Day, celebration of the world tree Yggdrasil, of the reality world it represents, of trees and nature — 22 April
Winterfinding, celebration which marks the beginning of winter, held on a date between Haustblot and Winternights (mid-October)
Summerfinding, celebration which marks the beginning of summer, held on a date between Ostara and Walpurgis Night (mid-April)

Practice
Celebration commonly takes place outdoors in the form of a communal gathering.

Dates of celebration
The precise dates on which festivals are celebrated are often flexible. Dates may be on the days of the quarter and cross-quarter days proper, the nearest full moon, the nearest new moon, or the nearest weekend for secular convenience.  The festivals were originally celebrated by peoples in the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, the traditional times for seasonal celebrations do not agree with the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere or near the equator. Pagans in the Southern Hemisphere often advance these dates by six months to coincide with their own seasons.

Offerings

Offerings of food, drink, various objects, etc. have been central in ritual propitiation and veneration for millennia. Modern Pagan practice strongly avoids sacrificing animals in favour of grains, herbs, milk, wines, incense, baked goods, minerals, etc. The exception being with ritual feasts including meat, where the inedible parts of the animal are often burned as offerings while the community eats the rest.

Sacrifices are typically offered to gods and ancestors by burning them. Burying and leaving offerings in the open are also common in certain circumstances. The purpose of offering is to benefit the venerated, show gratitude, and give something back, strengthening the bonds between humans and divine and between members of a community.

Narratives

Celtic

It is a misconception in some quarters of the Neopagan community, influenced by the writings of Robert Graves, that historical Celts had an overarching narrative for the entire cycle of the year. While the various Celtic calendars include some cyclical patterns, and a belief in the balance of light and dark, these beliefs vary between the different Celtic cultures. Modern preservationists and revivalists usually observe the four 'fire festivals' of the Gaelic Calendar, and some also observe local festivals that are held on dates of significance in the different Celtic nations.

Slavic

Slavic mythology tells of a persisting conflict involving Perun, god of thunder and lightning, and Veles, the black god and horned god of the underworld. Enmity between the two is initiated by Veles' annual ascent up the world tree in the form of a huge serpent and his ultimate theft of Perun's divine cattle from the heavenly domain. Perun retaliates to this challenge of the divine order by pursuing Veles, attacking with his lightning bolts from the sky. Veles taunts Perun and flees, transforming himself into various animals and hiding behind trees, houses, even people. (Lightning bolts striking down trees or homes were explained as results of this.) In the end Perun overcomes and defeats Veles, returning him to his place in the realm of the dead. Thus the order of the world is maintained.

The idea that storms and thunder are actually divine battle is pivotal to the changing of the seasons. Dry periods are identified as chaotic results of Veles' thievery. This duality and conflict represents an opposition of the natural principles of earth, water, substance, and chaos (Veles) and of heaven, fire, spirit, order (Perun), not a clash of good and evil. The cosmic battle between the two also echoes the ancient Indo-European narrative of a fight between the sky-borne storm god and chthonic dragon.

On the great night (New Year), two children of Perun are born, Jarilo, god of fertility and vegetation and son of the Moon, and Morana, goddess of nature and death and daughter of the Sun. On the same night, the infant Jarilo is snatched and taken to the underworld, where Veles raises him as his own. At the time of the spring equinox, Jarilo returns across the sea from the world of the dead, bringing with him fertility and spring from the evergreen underworld into the realm of the living. He meets his sister Morana and courts her. With the beginning of summer, the two are married bringing fertility and abundance to Earth, ensuring a bountiful harvest. The union of Perun's kin and Veles' stepson brings peace between two great gods, staving off storms which could damage the harvest. After the harvest, however, Jarilo is unfaithful to his wife and she vengefully slays him, returning him to the underworld and renewing enmity between Perun and Veles. Without her husband, god of fertility and vegetation, Morana – and all of nature with her – withers and freezes in the ensuing winter. She grows into the old and dangerous goddess of darkness and frost, eventually dying by the year's end only to be reborn again with her brother in the new year.

Modern Wicca and Neo-druidism
 

In Wicca, the narrative of the Wheel of the Year traditionally centres on the sacred marriage of the God and the Goddess and the god/goddess duality. In this cycle, the God is perpetually born from the Goddess at Yule, grows in power at the vernal equinox (as does the Goddess, now in her maiden aspect), courts and impregnates the Goddess at Beltane, reaches his peak at the summer solstice, wanes in power at Lammas, passes into the underworld at Samhain (taking with him the fertility of the Goddess/Earth, who is now in her crone aspect) until he is once again born from Her mother/crone aspect at Yule. The Goddess, in turn, ages and rejuvenates endlessly with the seasons, being courted by and giving birth to the Horned God.

Many Wiccan, Neo-Druid, and eclectic Neopagans incorporate a narrative of the Holly King and Oak King as rulers of the waning year and the waxing year respectively. These two figures battle endlessly with the turning of the seasons. At the summer solstice, the Holly King defeats the Oak King and commences his reign. After the Autumn equinox the Oak King slowly begins to regain his power as the sun begins to wane. Come the winter solstice the Oak King in turn vanquishes the Holly King.After the spring equinox the sun begins to wax again and the Holly King slowly regains his strength until he once again defeats the Oak King at the summer solstice. The two are ultimately seen as essential parts of a whole, light and dark aspects of the male God, and would not exist without each other.

The Holly King is often portrayed as a woodsy figure, similar to the modern Santa Claus, dressed in red with sprigs of holly in his hair and the Oak King as a fertility god.

"Norman Peterkin

George Norman Peterkin (Liverpool, 21 December 1886 - Guildford, 15 December 1982), known to all as Norman, was an English composer and music publisher. He is perhaps best known today for his brief song “I heard a piper piping”.

Peterkin was born in Liverpool and was mostly self-taught in music. He started work with the local organ builder Rushworth & Dreaper in the late 1900s, moving to their Singapore office in 1911, and later to Hong Kong. While there he established himself as a pianist and also began to compose, much influenced by Cyril Scott.  He returned to England in 1918. In 1924 he became second-in-command to Hubert Foss at the Oxford University Press Music Department (which had published some of his songs), taking over as head of department when Foss resigned in 1941. The strain of keeping things going almost alone throughout the war exhausted him, and he asked for early retirement at the end of 1947. He was succeeded at OUP by Alan Frank.

As a composer, Peterkin wrote mostly songs and a few short piano pieces. Most of these were composed during his stay abroad, on his return to Liverpool in the early 1920s and then on to London. His contemporaries there were Peter Warlock and Bernard van Dieren. He also became friendly with Kaikhosru Sorabji and Elizabeth Poston, whom he encouraged. Sorabji dedicated four of his works to Peterkin.

"Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides

Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides (abbreviated Li-NMC, LNMC, NMC or NCM) are mixed oxides of lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt. They have the general formula LiNixMnyCozO2. The most important representatives have a composition with x + y + z = 1 and are closely related to lithium cobalt(III) oxide (LiCoO2) and have a layered structure like these. Nowadays, NMCs they are among the most important storage materials for lithium ions in lithium ion batteries. They are used there on the positive pole side, which acts as the cathode during discharge.

Use of NMC accumulators 

NMC batteries are found in most electric cars. NMC batteries were installed in the BMW ActiveE in 2011/2011, and from 2013 in the BMW i8. Electric cars with NMC batteries include, as of 2020: Audi e-tron GE, BAIC EU5 R550, BMW i3, BYD Yuan EV535, Chevrolet Bolt, Hyundai Kona Electric, Jaguar I-Pace, Jiangling Motors JMC E200L, NIO ES6, Nissan Leaf S Plus, Renault ZOE, Roewe Ei5, VW e-Golf and VW ID.3. There are only a few electric car manufacturers that do not use NMC in their traction batteries. The most important exception is Tesla, as Tesla uses NCA batteries for its vehicles. However, the home storage Tesla Powerwall is said to be based on NMC.

NMC is also used for mobile electronics such as mobile phones/smartphones, laptops in most pedelec batteries. For these applications, batteries with lithium cobalt oxide LCO were still used almost exclusively in 2008. Another application of NMC batteries are battery storage power stations. In Korea, for example, two such storage systems with NMC for frequency regulation were installed in 2016: one with 16 MW capacity and 6 MWh energy and one with 24 MW and 9 MWh. In 2017/2018, a battery with over 30 MW capacity and 11 MWh was installed and commissioned in Newman in the Australian state of Western Australia.

Properties of NMC accumulators 
The cell voltage of lithium ion batteries with NMC is 3.6–3.7 V.

"Shay Elliott Memorial Race

The Shay Elliott Memorial race is a one-day race held in Spring in Ireland. It is run in honour of former Irish professional cyclist Seamus Shay Elliott. The race was previously known as the Route de Chill Mhantain. It became the Shay Elliott Trophy in the late sixties, then the Shay Elliott Memorial after his death in 1971. The race is the most prestigious Irish one-day event after the national championships.

History
In 1958, the first Route de Chill Mhantáin was held, organised by Bray Wheelers, a cycling club from Bray, Co. Wicklow. It was devised by Joe Loughman one of the main organisers of the club who wanted to make a tough race over the Wicklow Mountains. The race begins and finishes in Bray after taking a loop that goes over the Wicklow Mountains including the steep ascent of the Old Wicklow Gap, locally known as Croghan, as well as the Glenmalure climb where there is the Shay Elliott monument. The Route de Chill Mhantáin was the first open massed start race that Bray Wheelers had organised. The first edition was won by John Lackey. The race was renamed ‘The Shay Elliott Memorial’ in later years. The trophy presented each year was won by Elliott himself as a prize for best amateur in France in 1955. Winners of the race include the best of Irish cycling including two-time champion Sean Kelly (who was the only rider to have won the race while still a junior), former professional Peter Crinnion, two time Tour of Ireland winner Pat McQuaid, Peter Doyle (the first rider to win the Tour of Ireland and the Ras Tailteann) and Phil Cassidy (a two-time winner of the Ras Tailteann). In 2002 the race became an international race.
The 2015 edition of the race was won by former Track World Champion Martyn Irvine.

"Timeline of the Mensalão scandal

The Mensalão scandal () took place in Brazil in 2005 and threatened to bring down the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Mensalão is a neologism and variant of the word for ""big monthly payment"" (salário mensal or mensalidade).

June 
 8 June 2005 - A CPI is installed to investigate alleged corruption in the Post Office after the testimony of Roberto Jefferson. Workers Party treasurer Delúbio Soares denied the claims in a press conference and said that he would authorize the investigation of all of his personal bank accounts.
 14 June - Additional testimony of Roberto Jefferson in front of the Council of Ethics of the Chamber of the Deputies. Jefferson says that he informed the ministers Aldo Rebelo, , Ciro Gomes, Miro Teixeira, José Dirceu and Antônio Palocci about the alleged payments. Palocci and Dirceu deny they were warned by Jefferson; Rebelo, Guia, and Gomes, and Teixeira confirm that Jefferson warned them about the existence of the ""mensalão"". Roberto Jefferson states that José Dirceu should resign from the government ""quickly"".
 16 June - Minister of Civilian Household  José Dirceu resigns. Dirceu was labeled by his opponents the ""Rasputin"" of the government because he was a strong figure with influence over President Lula.
 17 June - Roberto Jefferson leaves the presidency of the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB)
 22 June - Deputy Raquel Teixeira (Goiás) testifying in front of the Council of Ethics confirms that on 18 February 2004 deputy Sandro Mabel of the Liberal Party (PL) invited her to leave the PSDB in exchange for a monthly payment if she also promised to support the government. According to Raquel, the offer was R$30,000 (about 12,913 USD) a month - which could be increased up to a sum of R$50,000 (about 21,521 USD) with R$1 million ($430,420) as a ""bonus"" at the end of the year. Raquel says she denounced the request and spoke to the governor of Goiás Marconi Perillo about it.
 22 June - Governor Marconi Perillo (PSDB-Goiás) tells the Council of Ethics that on 5 March 2004 during an official visit of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to the food enterprise Perdigão S.A. in Rio Verde, he notified and warned the president about the offer received by deputy Raquel Teixeira (PSDB-Goiás).
 30 June – With his left eye injured due to an accident moving an armoire - Deputy Roberto Jefferson (PTB-Rio de Janeiro) testifies to the Post Office CPI. Jefferson says that the agency of the Rural Bank at the 9th floor of Brasilia Shopping mall is used to withdraw the money of mensalão since the delivery by suitcases got very risky.

July
 4 July – Workers Party member Silvio Pereira resigns from his post as secretary general of the party. According to Jefferson he was the manager of the ""mensalão"".
 4 July – The magazine Veja publishes photos of a contract from the Bank BMG S/A indicating Marcos Valério as the guarantor of a 17 February 2003 R$2.4 million bank loan to the Workers Party (PT). The document was signed by Workers Party President José Genoíno and party treasurer Delúbio Soares. Genoino claimed that he didn’t read the document when he signed it. Valério had paid back the first R$300,000 of the loan.
 5 July – Workers Party (PT) treasurer Delúbio Soares resigned.
 Deputy  (leader of the PMDB) claimed that Valério, despite not having a public post, directly took part in the nomination of directors for strategic positions in state-run enterprises. Valério denied the claim.
 6 July – It is discovered that Marcos Valério had moved more than R$800 million within his bank accounts in the past 3 years.
 6 July – Marcos Valério testified before the Post Office CPI and maintained that he did not do anything illegal. The veracity of his testimony was questioned by parliamentarians and many political analysts because Valério spoke under a preemptive habeas corpus (exempting the individual from certain legal sanctions for not telling the truth) granted by Brazilian courts.
 6 July – Deputy   (PL-RJ), former bishop of the Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus (Universal Church of the Kingdom of God) denied involvement in the scandal.
 7 July – It became public that the Bank of Brazil (BB) had loaned R$20 million to the Workers' Party without any guarantor or guarantees. The CPI for the Post Office began to investigate loans to the Workers’ Party. There were also new claims that members or supporters of the Workers' Party had unique control of the bank.
 7 July – The bank, postal, and telephone records of Roberto Jefferson, Delúbio Soares, José Genoíno and José Dirceu were subpoenaed.
 8 July - José Adalberto Vieira da Silva, an adviser to deputy José Nobre Guimarães, who is the brother of Workers’ Party President José Genoíno, was detained at Cumbica airport in Guarulhos (SP) with US$100,000 in cash stuffed in his underpants and R$200,000 in his luggage.
 9 July - Workers' Party president José Genoíno resigns.
 12 July - Lula completes a ministerial reform which includes the removal of cabinet-level ministerial status from Luiz Gushiken, the Secretariat of Government Communication and Strategic Management (Secom), who had been suspected of having questionable relationships with pensions firms under his jurisdiction.
 14 July – Mauro Marcelo, director of the Agência Brasileira de Inteligência (Abin), resigns after calling the Post Office CPI a ""circus ring"" and their members ""wild beasts"".
 Henrique Pizzolato, director of Marketing and Communications for the Banco do Brasil petitions for retirement. Several days earlier, Fernanda Karina Somaggio, former secretary of Marcos Valério had accused the director of being part of the circle that connected Valério to the government. Pizzolato had already been attacked because he used Banco do Brasil funds to pay for a Brazilian country music (sertaneja) concert which returned profits to the Workers Party (PT).
 15 July -  During an interview with the national newscast Jornal Nacional (Rede Globo) Marcos Valério admits that the funds in his bank accounts were used as loans to the Workers Party (PT), thereby administering an illegal off-book accounting scheme for the party.
 15 July -  A number of non-governmental parties assert that Valerio's concessions are actually a strategy to reduce the apparent severity of the crimes since the penalties for off-book accounting are less severe. Some parliamentarians on the CPI recall the ""Uruguay Operation"", a fictitious financial entity created by some supporters of the impeached President Fernando Collor de Mello to explain his alleged large financial gains. The deputy Eduardo Paes (PSDB-RJ) labels the Marcos Valério claims as the ""Paraguay Operation"" as an allusion to this episode. The Paraguayan ambassador to Brazil Luis González Arias protests against the use of the name of his country in this ""pejorative manner"".
 17 July -  During an interview to Rede Globo, Workers Party treasurer Delúbio Soares says that the only impropriety he committed was the use of off-book accounting as described by the businessman Marcos Valério two days earlier.
 17 July - In Paris for the Bastille Day celebrations, Brazilian President Lula says during an exclusive interview with a Brazilian freelance journalist aired in Brazil by Rede Globo that off-book accounting is a ""common practice in Brazil"".
 19 July -  The former secretary-general of the Workers Party (PT) Silvio Pereira testifies with habeas corpus protection before the CPI on the Post Office. He does not explain how he received a Land Rover from an employee of the firm GDK whose president César Oliveira Silvio he admits to knowing. GDK had won a major contract of R$90 million together with Petrobras in 2004. Silvio Pereira, whose salary as a worker of the PT is R$9,000 per month, is accused of living a lifestyle incompatible with his inheritance and income, including a penthouse apartment in São Paulo and a mansion in Ilhabela

"Merritt Island Dragon

The Merritt Island Dragon or Merrit Island River Dragon was a dragon-shaped green concrete structure that stood at the southern tip of Merritt Island, known as Dragon Point, where the Indian River Lagoon splits to form the Banana River Lagoon. The dragon was built in 1971 by Florida artist Lewis VanDercar and property owner Aynn Christal.  In 1981, the statue was expanded for new property owner Warren McFadden, with the addition of a tail, an extended neck, two cavepeople a caveman named Fred and a cavewoman named Wilma and four hatchling dragons named Joy, Sunshine, Charity, and Freedom. The statues were located in the city of Melbourne, Florida, north of the Eau Gallie Causeway.

The dragon was created from  of concrete and steel, and stood  high and  long. Known as ""Annie"", the dragon served as a landmark for both locals and boaters, and also as a playhouse for children. On special occasions, the dragon would breathe fire.

In August 2002, the sculpture was badly damaged, and partially collapsed into the water during a storm; vandalism was blamed for contributing to the statue's destruction. The owner and the Brevard County Commissioners were unable to agree on a rehabilitation effort; there was a plan in 2004 to reconstruct the sculpture, while in 2008, a developer planned a luxury hotel and spa on the Dragon Point site with a reconstructed dragon statue as its centerpiece, but both plans fell through.

A children's book about the dragon, River Dragon: A Real Florida Fairy Tale, was published in 2003.

Save Dragon Point, an organization dedicated to rebuilding the dragon statue, was founded in May 2012. In August, the mansion on the property where the dragon had stood was scheduled to be demolished and the property sold. Save Dragon Point changed its name to Annie and Kids Arts and Education Foundation.

In January 2015, Don Facciobene, local builder and developer, bought the property. He announced that a new dragon named ""Rojak"" will be built. According to the story of Dragon Point Rojak is Annie's fifth hatchling who was kept hidden. In April Rojak was revealed to be built by 2017.

The inaugural Dragon Boat Festival is planned for June 13, 2015. Proceeds are intended to benefit Save Dragon Point.

Demolition work began at Dragon Point in March of 2017, clearing room for a future multi-million dollar riverfront mansion and for ""Rojak.""

"Nyhavn 11

Nyhavn 11 is a listed property overlooking the Nyhavn canal in central Copenhagen, Denmark.

History
 
A two-storey building was built at the site in about 1700. One of its first owners was Jacob Severin. He had married rich and was in 1733 granted a full monopoly on trade with Greenland where he founded the town Jacobshavn (literally ""Port Jacob"").

Ludvig Ferdinand Römer established a sugar refinery in the building in 1754. He had been governor of the Danish Gold Coast. His wife was Anna Cathrine Widderkamp and the couple had 14 children. The property was expanded with two extra storeys in 1835-1836 for a grocer named Harboe.

The actor Christian Niemann Rosenkildelived in the building with his family from 1842 to 1749. His daughter, Julie, later known by her married name Julie Sødring, who became one of the leading Danish actresses of her time, had her debut at the Royal Danish Theatre in the play Den Sorte Dronning (The Black Queen) in 1843. Many artist frequented the home, including the Swedish singer Jenny Lind. Another well-known actor, Poul Reumert, have also lived in the building. He grew up at Nyhavn 63.

The building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish national registry of protected buildings in 1932.

Building

 
The building is  four storeys tall and five bays wide. It has a red tile roof with four dormers. Above the gate is a figure of a sugar-baker holding a sugarloaf in one hand and a sugar tin in the other. The figure dates from Römer's sugar refinery. It served as a means of identifications at a time when house numbers had not yet been introduced. Many other houses along the Nyhavn quay feature similar signs.

An appendix with staircase on the rear side of the building dates from 1875. The courtyard was refurbished in  1963 to design by the landscape architect Knud Lund-Sørensen.

Today
The leading Danish lamp manufacturer Louis Poulsen has been headquartered in the building since 1908.

"Petticoat affair

The Petticoat Affair (also known as the Eaton Affair), was a U.S. scandal involving members of President Andrew Jackson's Cabinet and their wives, from 1829 to 1831.  Led by Floride Calhoun, wife of Vice President (VP) John C. Calhoun, these women, dubbed the ""Petticoats,"" socially ostracized then–Secretary of War John Eaton and his wife Peggy Eaton, over disapproval of the circumstances surrounding the Eaton's marriage; what they deemed as her failure to meet the ""moral standards of a Cabinet Wife"".  

The Petticoat Affair rattled the entire Jackson Administration, and inevitably led to the resignation of all but one Cabinet member.  The ordeal facilitated Martin Van Buren's rise to the presidency, and was in part responsible for VP Calhoun's transformation from a ""Nationwide political figure with Presidential aspirations"", into a ""Sectional-leader of the Southern states"".

Background
Margaret ""Peggy"" Eaton was the eldest daughter of William O'Neill, owner of The Franklin House, a boarding house and tavern located in Washington, D.C. a short distance from the White House that was a well-known social hub popular with politicians and military officials. Peggy was well-educated for a woman of that era - she studied French and was known for her ability to play the piano. William T. Barry, who later served as Postmaster General, wrote ""of a charming little girl ... who very frequently plays the piano, and entertains us with agreeable songs."" As a young girl, her reputation had already begun to come under scrutiny, due to being employed in a bar frequented by men as well as her casual bantering with the boarding house's clientele. In her elder years, Peggy reminisced, ""While I was still in pantalettes and rolling hoops with other girls, I had the attention of men, young and old; enough to turn a girl's head.""

When Peggy was 15 years old, her father intervened to prevent her attempt to elope with an Army officer. In 1816, the now-17-year old married John B. Timberlake (1777-1828), a purser in the United States Navy.  Timberlake, aged 39, had a reputation as a drunkard and was heavily in debt. The Timberlakes became acquainted with John Eaton in 1818. At the time, Eaton was a wealthy 28-year-old widower and newly elected U.S. Senator from Tennessee, despite not yet having reached the constitutionally-mandated minimum age of 30. He was also a long-time friend of Andrew Jackson. 

Once Timberlake told Eaton of his financial troubles, Eaton unsuccessfully attempted to have the Senate pass legislation that would authorize payment of the debts Timberlake had accrued during his Naval service. Eventually, Eaton paid Timberlake's debts, and procured him a lucrative posting to the U.S. Navy's Mediterranean Squadron; many rumormongers asserted that Eaton aided Timberlake as a means to remove him from Washington, in order for Eaton to socialize with Peggy. While with the Mediterranean Squadron, Timberlake died on April 2, 1828. This served to fuel new rumors throughout Washington, suggesting he had taken his own life, as the result of Eaton's supposed affair with Peggy. Medical examiners concluded Timberlake had died of pneumonia, brought on by pulmonary disease.

Controversy
Jackson was elected president in 1828, with his term set to begin on March 4, 1829.  He was reportedly fond of Peggy Timberlake and encouraged Eaton to marry her. They were wed on January 1, 1829; only nine months after her husband's death. Customarily, it would have been considered ""proper"" for their marriage to have followed a longer mourning period.

Historian John F. Marszalek explained his opinion on the ""real reasons Washington society found Peggy unacceptable"": 
""She did not know her place; she forthrightly spoke up about anything that came to her mind, even topics of which women were supposed to be ignorant. She thrust herself into the world in a manner inappropriate for a woman. ... Accept her, and society was in danger of disruption. Accept this uncouth, impure, forward, worldly woman, and the wall of virtue and morality would be breached and society would have no further defenses against the forces of frightening change. Margaret Eaton was not that important in herself; it was what she represented that constituted the threat. Proper women had no choice; they had to prevent her acceptance into society as part of their defense of that society's morality.""

When Jackson assumed the presidency, he appointed Eaton as Secretary of War.  Floride Calhoun, Second Lady of the United States, led the wives of other Washington political figures, mostly those of Jackson's cabinet members in an ""anti-Peggy"" coalition, which served to shun the Eatons socially and publicly. The women refused to pay courtesy calls to the Eatons at their home, to receive them as visitors, and denied them invitations to parties and other social events.

Emily Donelson, niece of Andrew Jackson's late wife Rachel Donelson Robards, and the wife of Jackson's confidant Andrew Jackson Donelson, served as Jackson's ""surrogate First Lady"". Emily Donelson chose to side with the Calhoun faction, thus leading to Jackson replacing her with his daughter-in-law Sarah Yorke Jackson, as his official hostess. Secretary of State, Martin Van Buren, was a widower, and the only unmarried member of the Cabinet; he raised himself in Jackson's esteem by aligning himself with the Eatons.

Jackson's sympathy for the Eatons stemmed in part from his late wife Rachel being the subject of innuendo during the presidential campaign, when questions arose as to whether her first marriage had been legally ended before she married Jackson. Jackson believed these attacks were the cause of Rachel's death on December 22, 1828, several weeks after his election to the presidency.

Eaton's entry into a high-profile cabinet post helped intensify the opposition of Mrs. Calhoun's group. In addition, Calhoun was becoming the focal point of opposition to Jackson; Calhoun's supporters opposed a second term for Jackson because they wanted Calhoun elected president.  In addition, Jackson favored and Calhoun opposed the protective tariff that came to be known as the Tariff of Abominations. U.S. tariffs on imported goods generally favored northern industries by limiting competition, but southerners opposed them because the tariffs raised the price of finished goods, but not the raw materials produced in the south.  The dispute over the tariff led to the Nullification Crisis of 1832, with southerners - including Calhoun - arguing that states could refuse to obey federal laws to which they objected, even to the point of secession from the Union, while Jackson vowed to prevent secession and preserve the Union at any cost. Because Calhoun was the most visible opponent of the Jackson administration, Jackson felt that Calhoun and other anti-Jackson officials were fanning the flames of the Peggy Eaton controversy in an attempt to gain political leverage. Duff Green, a Calhoun protégé and editor of the United States Telegraph, accused Eaton of secretly working to have pro-Calhoun cabinet members Samuel D. Ingham (Treasury) and John Branch (Navy) removed from their positions.

Eaton took his revenge on Calhoun. In 1830, reports had emerged which accurately stated that Calhoun, while Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These reports infuriated Jackson. Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson about the possibility of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson at the time of the Seminole War. Eaton did nothing. This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the Telegraph. Their publication gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy, which further enraged the President.

Resolution
The dispute was finally resolved when Van Buren offered to resign, giving Jackson the opportunity to reorganize his cabinet by asking for the resignations of the anti-Eaton cabinet members. Postmaster General William T. Barry was the lone cabinet member to stay, and Eaton eventually received appointments that took him away from Washington, first as governor of Florida Territory, and then as minister to Spain.

On June 17, the day before Eaton formally resigned, a text appeared in the Telegraph stating that it had been ""proved"" that the families of Ingham, Branch, and Attorney General John M. Berrien had refused to associate with Mr. Eaton. Eaton wrote to all three men demanding that they answer for the article. Ingham sent back a contemptuous letter stating that, while he was not the source for the article, the information was still true. On June 18, Eaton challenged Ingham to a duel through Eaton's brother in law, Dr. Philip G. Randolph, who visited Ingham twice and the second time threatened him with personal harm if he did not comply with Eaton's demands. Randolph was dismissed, and the next morning Ingham sent a note to Eaton discourteously declining the invitation, and describing his situation as one of ""pity and contempt."" Eaton wrote a letter back to Ingham accusing him of cowardice. Ingham was then informed that Eaton, Randolph, and others were looking to assault him. He gathered together his own bodyguard, and was not immediately molested. However, he reported that for the next two nights Eaton and his men continued to lurk about his dwelling and threaten him. He then left the city, and returned safely to his home. Ingham communicated to Jackson his version of what took place, and Jackson then asked Eaton to answer for the charge. Eaton admitted that he ""passed by"" the place where Ingham had been staying, ""but at no point attempted to enter ... or besiege it.""

Aftermath

In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to Great Britain. Calhoun killed the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming his act would ""...kill him, sir, kill him dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick."" However, Calhoun only made Van Buren seem the victim of petty politics, which were rooted largely in the Eaton controversy. This raised Van Buren even further in Jackson's esteem. Van Buren was nominated for vice president, and was elected as Jackson's running mate when Jackson won a second term in 1832. Van Buren thus became the de facto heir to the presidency, and succeeded Jackson in 1837.

Although Emily Donelson had supported Floride Calhoun, after the controversy ended Jackson asked her to return as his official hostess; she resumed these duties in conjunction with Sarah Yorke Jackson until returning to Tennessee after contracting tuberculosis, leaving Sarah Yorke Jackson to serve alone as Jackson's hostess.

John Calhoun resigned as vice president shortly before the end of his term, and returned with his wife to South Carolina.  Quickly elected to the U.S. Senate, he returned to Washington not as a national leader with presidential prospects, but as a regional leader who argued in favor of states' rights and the expansion of slavery.

In regard to the Petticoat affair, Jackson later remarked, ""I [would] rather have live vermin on my back than the tongue of one of these Washington women on my reputation.""  To Jackson, Peggy Eaton was just another of many wronged women who over his lifetime he had known and defended. He believed that every woman he had defended in his life, including her, had been the victim of ulterior motives, so that political enemies could bring him down.

According to historian Daniel Walker Howe, the episode influenced the emergence of feminism. The Cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all women were at stake. They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement.  The aristocratic wives of European diplomats in Washington shrugged the matter off; they had their national interest to uphold, and had seen how life worked in Paris and London.

Legacy
Historian Robert V. Remini says that ""the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And it was all so needless.""

The 1936 film The Gorgeous Hussy is a fictionalized account of the Petticoat affair. It featured Joan Crawford as Peggy O'Neal, Robert Taylor as John Timberlake, Lionel Barrymore as Andrew Jackson, and Franchot Tone as John Eaton.

"Balaban (instrument)

Balaban, or balaman () is cylindrical-bore, double-reed wind instrument about  long with eight finger holes and one thumb hole. Balaban, one of the ancient wind instruments, is played in all corners of Azerbaijan. This instrument is played in Iranian Azerbaijan and in the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Balaban can be made of mulberry or other harder woods, such as walnut. The bore through the instrument is about  in diameter. The double reed is made out of a single tube of cane about six cm long and pressed flat at one end. The performer uses air stored in his cheeks to keep playing the balaban while he inhales air into his lungs. This “circular” breathing technique is commonly used with all the double-reed instruments in the Middle East.

Structure
Balaban, which is often called also yasti (flat) balaban for flat mouthpiece and soft sound, consists of body made of apricot tree, cane, barrow and cover. Body has 8 holes on the surface and 1 on the back in the middle of 1st and 2nd holes (sound fret) on the surface. It consists of a stem, a reed, a regulator, and a cap.

The stem of the balaban, or govda, is a  cylindrical tube made primarily of apricot wood (sometimes also hazel, pear, mulberry, boxwood, etc.). The process of carving a balaban stem is called balaban chakma. The upper end of the stem (bash or kup) is given a round shape, whereas the lower end (ayag) is sharpened. The bore is  in diameter. Eight holes or ""tones"" constituting a ""sound tone"" (sas pardasi) are made on the obverse and another one is made on the bottom side, opposite of the interval between the first and the second holes of the sas pardasi. Sometimes an additional hole called nizam pardasi is made on the lower end of the bottom side to ensure good timbre.

The holes made on the stem are classified as follows:

The reed (gamish, garghy or dil) made of club-rush that grows in an arid area is inserted into the upper end. It flattens and takes the shape of a double reed. It is tied to a   long and  wide regulator (kharak, boghazlig, boyundurug, ulama, akma) made of a willow or grape branch cut lengthways. The reed is then fixed by a collar-like regulator on one side and a  pivot on the other side. The cap (qapaq, aghizlig, kip, band, etc.) made of willow, hazel, cornel or mulberry is put on the reed to prevent it from damage. It is tied to the regulator in order not to be lost.

Use
On solemn occasions such as weddings and holiday ceremonies, a balaban-player is accompanied by a percussionist. A traditional Azeri musical group consisting of two balaban-players and a percussionist is called balabanchilar dastasi. The short selection of Azerbaijani mugham played in balaban, national wind instrument was included on the Voyager Golden Record, attached to the Voyager spacecraft as representing world music, included among many cultural achievements of humanity. It was also used in pastoral songs and funeral music. According to Huseyngulu Sarabski, hunters played the balaban to attract quails. Certain types of the balaban are also used in ashik music.

Legacy
Kamil Jalilov's recording of the song with balaban was included on the Voyager Golden Record, attached to the Voyager spacecraft as representing mugham, only Azerbaijani song included among many cultural achievements of humanity.

"American Biographical Institute

The American Biographical Institute (ABI) was a paid-inclusion vanity biographical reference directory publisher based in Raleigh, North Carolina which had been publishing biographies since 1967. It generated revenue from sales of fraudulent certificates and books. Each year the company awarded hundreds of ""Man of the Year"" or ""Woman of the Year"" awards at between $195 and $295 each.

Its awards were frequently denounced as scams by politicians, journalists,  and others. The Government of Western Australia's ScamNet service considers the American Biographical Institute to be a scam vanity publisher ""who appeals to people who want a plaque on their wall or see their name in a book, even if the honour has no real credibility—in effect, they have purchased the honour."" The company went bankrupt in 2012.

The company's owner, Arlene Calhoun, also ran another purveyor of for-profit awards called the United Cultural Convention and another vanity press called the Pentland Press or Ivy House Publishing Group.

Operations

The ABI invited individuals to purchase various honors as a commemorative in their inclusion for a specific biography. One former employee explained that the company bought mailing lists from organizations, and using those names, they sent out blanket mailings inviting individuals to be in biographical books or accept awards. Such honors include ""International Man of the Year,"" ""Most Admired Man of the Decade"" or ""Outstanding Man of the 21st Century"" (see list below), or to be included in ABI publications, such as 500 Leaders of Science  or The World Book of Knowledge,  in exchange for a contribution fee.  Those who accept, who sometimes write their own biographies,  are offered books or certificates at prices as high as US $795.

On its website, the publisher describes itself as ""one of the world’s leading biographical reference publishers and authorities on global contemporary achievement"" and claims that ""inclusion in an ABI reference title is based on personal achievement alone and is not available for purchase."" The ABI shares an address and P.O. box with the United Cultural Convention, another purveyor of for-profit awards.

The Chairman of the ABI, Arlene Calhoun, also runs another vanity press, Pentland Press (d/b/a Ivy House Publishing Group).

""World Forum""
The ABI is also the co-host with the International Biographical Centre of a yearly World Forum, (previously the International Congress on Arts and Communications) which invites a group for a week of professional seminars, artistic displays and performances, and culture sharing. Host cities over the 31 yearly meetings have included: New York; Washington D.C.; New Orleans; San Francisco; Edinburgh; Cambridge, UK; Nairobi; Madrid; Lisbon; Cambridge, Mass. USA; Oxford, UK.; Singapore; and Sydney. The Maitre Artiste of Ethiopia, Afewerk Tekle was a regular attendee. No proceedings of these forums are produced except from the ABI which includes these in a newsletter. The often prestigious location is then quoted on their literature as if to add gravitas.

In 2007, referring to the International Biographical Centre, the American Biographical Institute and Marquis Who's Who, Jan Margosian, consumer information coordinator for the Oregon Department of Justice, warned consumers to be wary and called the companies ""pretty tacky"", adding ""I don't know why they would put you in there if they weren't hoping to get you to buy the book.. ""You truly have to look at how they are marketing and what the spin is. It's something you might want to watch out for.""

Awards and titles
New awards are continually created and marketed. Most awards are available for between US $195 and $495, payable by the recipient, depending on their level of prestige and the quality of the printing on the certificate and the material in the frame or mount.  In 2005 the Institute awarded 200 ""Man of the Year"" awards at between $195 and $295 each.

American Biographical Institute gives awards like Man of The Year or Scientific Award of the Excellence to many people in a year. Every award can be purchased from them.

The ABI does not provide a consolidated list of all the awards, medals, diplomas and certificates it issues,  but the titles of the honors may be identified through the recipients' use of them in their résumés.

"Type 93 surface-to-air missile

The  is a surface-to-air missile used by the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. It is the vehicle-borne version of the Type 91 missile.

It is known in JSDF ranks as the Closed Arrow.

Description
It was first deployed in 1993, due to a need to replace L-90 35mm Anti-Aircraft Twin Cannons in JGSDF service. It is typically deployed on a modified launcher Kōkidōsha (military version Toyota Mega Cruiser) with a total of eight missiles ready to fire.

Operation
The Type 93 is a vast improvement over the L-90 as it has the ability to track down and shoot down enemy aircraft thanks to infrared homing on its system.

"Search by sound

Search by sound is the retrieval of information based on audio input. There are a handful of applications, specifically for mobile devices that utilize search by sound. Shazam (service), Soundhound (previously Midomi), Axwave, ACRCloud and others has seen considerable success by using a simple algorithm to match an acoustic fingerprint to a song in a library. These applications takes a sample clip of a song, or a user generated melody and checks a music library/music database to see where the clip matches with the song. From there, song information will queried and displayed to the user.

These kind of applications is mainly used for finding a song that the user does not already know. Searching by sound is not limited to just identifying songs, but also for identifying melodies, tunes or advertisements, sound library management and video files.

Acoustic Fingerprinting
The way these apps search by sound is through generating an acoustic fingerprint; a digital summary of the sound. A microphone is used to pick up an audio sample, which is then broken down into a simple numeric signature, a code unique to each track. Using the same method of fingerprinting sounds, when Shazam picks up a sound clip, it will generate a signature for that clip. Then it’s simple pattern matching from there using an extensive audio music database.

The practice of using acoustic fingerprints is not limited to just music however, but other areas of the entertainment business as well. Shazam also can identify television shows with the same technique of acoustic fingerprinting. Of course, this method of breaking down a sound sample into a unique signature is useless unless there is an extensive database of music with keys to match with the samples. Shazam has over 11 million songs in its database.

Other services such as Midomi and Soundhound allow users to add to that library of music in order to expand the chances to match a sound sample with its corresponding sound.

Query by Humming
Midomi and Soundhound both utilize query by humming. This is a branch off of acoustic fingerprints, but is still a musical retrieval system. After receiving a user generated hummed melody, which is the input query, and returns a ranked list of songs that is closest to the user query.

"General counsel

A general counsel, chief counsel, or chief legal officer (CLO) is the chief lawyer of a legal department, usually in a company or a governmental department.

In a company, the person holding the position typically reports directly to the CEO, and their duties involve overseeing and identifying the legal issues in all departments and their interrelation, including engineering, design, marketing, sales, distribution, credit, finance, human resources and production, as well as corporate governance and business policy. This would naturally require in most cases reporting directly to the owner or CEO overseeing the very business on which the CLO is expected to be familiar with and advise on the most confidential level.  This requires the CLO/general counsel to work closely with each of the other officers, and their departments, to appropriately be aware and advise.

Historically, general counsel often handled administrative tasks while outside lawyers in private practice handled more complex legal work. Since the 1980s, however, the general counsel position has become increasingly prominent in multinational companies, often directly advising the board of directors in place of outside lawyers. General counsel are now often among the most highly paid executives of major American corporations, and prominent American government lawyers and law firm partners are often hired for general counsel roles at prominent companies. Similar trends are also being seen in the United Kingdom and other countries.

General counsel often have broad roles encompassing crisis management, compliance reporting management and public policy advocacy. Many companies also hire in-house counsel to handle specialized tasks such as tax work, mergers and acquisitions, labor law and intellectual property, sometimes building in-house practice groups that rival the practices of major law firms.

Organizations

Global

The Association of Corporate Counsel

The Association of Corporate Counsel (""ACC"") has 35,000 general counsel, chief legal officer and other in-house counsel members located in 90 countries. ACC was founded as the American Corporate Counsel Association in 1982 and now includes more than 55 chapters, including in Argentina, Canada (four chapters), Europe, Israel, the Middle East and Singapore. Members have access to networking opportunities and education events through their regional chapter affiliations as well as global connections across practice area, job title and industry. ACC provides members with resources to deliver services and advice to their companies, promotes the value of in-house legal services and advocates on behalf of general counsel. For its general counsel and chief legal officer members, ACC hosts roundtables where members discuss current practice trends and issues.

United States

The General Counsel Forum

The Forum is an association of 700 general counsel and senior managing counsel. The non-profit organization was founded in the fall of 1998 as the Dallas-Fort Worth General Counsel's Management Practices Forum (“DFWGCMPF”). The association is a partnership between in-house members and outside counsel, known as underwriters. Members are general counsel and managing counsel of corporations, non-profit organizations and government agencies. The mission of the Forum is to improve the professional lives of general counsel and managing counsel through meaningful opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction and knowledge exchange, mentoring through professional development in legal best practices, ethics, governance, and compliance. In November 2000, the DFWGCMPF changed its name to The Texas General Counsel Forum, also known as The Forum, and in the following year the Houston Chapter was formed, and then the Austin-San Antonio Chapter was founded. In July 2005, the Forum hired a Chief Executive Officer with the mandate to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the organization, expand membership, and launch the organization nationally. In November 2009, the Board of Directors approved expanding the Forum nationally, and dropped the reference to Texas, becoming simply The General Counsel Forum. In the fall of 2012, the General Counsel Forum founded the Chicago Chapter.

Silicon Valley Association of General Counsel

The Silicon Valley Association of General Counsel (SVAGC) is a business league of chief legal officers from over 100 leading companies in the technology and life science sectors. Member companies include publicly traded corporations, private ventures and multinational subsidiaries located throughout the San Francisco Bay Area with operations in software, electronics, power technology, biotechnology, medical devices, health informatics, analytics, materials science, cleantech, fintech, telecommunications, network infrastructure, e-commerce and Internet services, artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The SVAGC hosts a series of monthly luncheons featuring expert presentations and off-the-record discussion about topics of professional interest.  It also assists members who wish to survey their peers or pose questions on particular issues, and cooperates in special projects such as the All Hands Meeting, an annual multi-track conference at the Santa Clara Convention Center, attended by general and staff counsel from hundreds of member and nonmember legal departments in the technology and life science sectors.

The SVAGC is a successor to the Peninsula Association of General Counsel (PAGC), formed in the early 1980s. In 2003, the SVAGC was formally organized as a California mutual benefit nonprofit corporation with the assistance of Ivy Associates, a consultancy to the Silicon Valley legal community that provides organizational support for the SVAGC and produces the All Hands Meeting.  Only SVAGC members, speakers and invited guests may attend monthly luncheons, which are funded by modest membership dues.  Individuals may join the SVAGC when they are the chief legal officer of a company with operations in Northern California that is publicly traded or which meets alternative criteria for private companies.  Some SVAGC members serve as general counsel for companies headquartered outside Northern California, and attend meetings when business travel brings them into the SF Bay Area.

United Kingdom
In the United Kingdom a group of general counsel, called the GC100, was officially launched on 9 March 2005 and brings together the senior legal officers of more than eighty five FTSE 100 companies. The GC100 group was created in response to the increasing volume and complexity of domestic and international law and regulation which impacts on UK listed companies. The group was formed with the support of Practical Law Company which acts as its secretariat.

The main objectives of the GC100 are to:

 Provide a forum for practical and business focused input on key areas of legislative and policy reform common to UK listed companies.
 Enable members to share best practice in relation to law, risk management, compliance and other areas of common interest.

Membership of the GC100 is by invitation only. At the AGM on the 16 January 2007 members voted in favour of extending membership to company secretaries as well as general counsel in the FTSE 100. The formal name of the GC100 is now ""The Association of General Counsel and Company Secretaries of the FTSE100"", although it will continue to be known as the GC100.

Mark Harding, the first chair of the GC100, has stated that the GC100 is not a campaigning body, although they work closely with the FD100 (a similar grouping of blue chip finance directors).

"Federation Space

Federation Space is a Star Trek-based space naval combat board game published by Task Force Games in 1981.

Design and gameplay
Federation Space was designed by Stephen Wilcox as a strategic companion to the more tactical Star Fleet Battles system.

The game components are:
 20"" x 24"" hex grid map
 432 back-printed die-cut cardboard counters
 fleet organization charts
 combat results table
 16-page rulebook

The map covers the large extent of space and many of the space-faring races described in the Star Trek TV series. This included the Federation, Klingons, Romulans, Gorns, Tholians and Hydrans. The Kzinti, a race mentioned in the Ringworld novels of Larry Niven, is also featured.

This is a game of naval fleet action involving dozens (or more) ships. Nearly all ships move at the same speed (Warp Factor 6). With so many ships involved, combat relies on a simple two-step reduction system to determine damage. Each ship only has two statuses: normal (counter face up); and damaged (counter face-down). Taking any damage results in a ship receiving the ""Damaged"" status. Taking any subsequent damage destroys the ship. Battles continue until one side is either destroyed or  withdraws.

Since this is a strategic-level game, some scenarios describe the capture of base stations, starbases or even planets.
 
There is also a campaign game for three or more players (each playing a different race) in which the players use diplomatic alliances and multiple navies to achieve their strategic goals.

Reception
In the March 1982 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 49), William A. Barton recommended the game, saying, ""Federation Space succeeds in its purpose to present a relatively simple, playable Star Trek game which can serve as a strategic module for Star Fleet Battles. Recommended to Trek gamers everywhere.""

In the August 1983 edition of Dragon (Issue 76), Tony Watson liked a number of things, including its simplicity of rules and combat, the fleet organization charts, the simple step-reduction damage system, and the colourful components. Watson criticized the size of the map, which although large compared to other combat games, was too small and restrictive for entire fleets. Watson also thought the game did not reward clever fleet maneuvers, relying instead on massed fleets simply engaging head on. He concluded, ""Federation Space has much to recommend itself. Both those who play Starfleet Battles and those interested in a fast-moving, action-oriented strategic space game should find this title to their liking.""

The line was once entirely electrified along its route. Electrification began in 1926, but ended in 2000 in favour of diesel locomotives.

The following junctions exist with the line:
 Canadian Pacific Cartier Subdivision at Sprecher (MP 81.7) where loaded ore cars from Coleman Mine are delivered
 Canadian Pacific Cartier Subdivision at Levack (MP 102.5) where empty ore cars from Clarabelle Mill are delivered
 Canadian Pacific Nickel Subdivision at Clarabelle (MP 3.3) where freight is exchanged with both the Canadian Pacific Railway and the Canadian National Railway
 Canadian Pacific Webbwood Subdivision (leased to Huron Central) at Copper Cliff (MP 4.8)

Locomotive roster
VAEX rosters 8 re-manufactured EMD GP38-4M locomotives for use on ore trains from the mines, slag trains from the smelter, or for local plant switching of various chemicals and products. These locomotives have upgraded electrical systems and are set up for remote operation.

"Erich Emminger

Erich Emminger (25 June 1880 – 30 August 1951) was a German lawyer and Catholic politician of the Center Party (Zentrum) and later of the Bavarian People's Party (BVP).

He served as Minister of Justice in the Weimar Republic from 30 November 1923 until 15 April 1924 under Chancellor Wilhelm Marx.

Early life
Erich Emminger was born on 25 June 1880 in Eichstätt, Bavaria. His parents were Johann Adolf Erich Emminger (1856-1909), a Gymnasialprofessor, and his wife Marie Therese (1854–99), née Müller, daughter of an Augsburg notary. Emminger married Maria Schärft in 1906. Their children included Otmar Emminger, future president of the Deutsche Bundesbank.

Following his training as a lawyer at Münster, Emminger practiced law at Augsburg (1906–08) and Nuremberg (1908–09). In 1909 he became a civil servant (state prosecutor and Amtsrichter). He participated in World War I first as a voluntary soldier and later as a Kriegsgerichtsrat (military judge).

Political career
Emminger was a member of the Catholic Center Party (Zentrum)and, from 1913-18 held a seat in the Reichstag for the constituency of Weilheim. In 1918, he joined the Bavarian People's Party (BVP) and represented it in the Reichstag 1920-33.

Emminger was Minister of Justice in the first cabinet of chancellor Wilhelm Marx, which took office on 30 November 1923. His tenure was defined by the passage of three decrees of 22 December 1923, 4 January and 13 February 1924, which were based on the  of 8 December 1923. These significantly changed civil and criminal law and the judiciary system with an eye towards speeding up proceedings. The reform of 4 January became known as the so-called Emminger Reform that among other things abolished the jury as trier of fact and replaced it with a mixed system of judges and lay judges in Germany's judiciary which still exists today. Schwurgerichte (formerly based on jurors) kept their name but were in fact replaced by lay judges. Since the reforms were successful, they were kept in place by later legislation once the enabling law had lapsed.

Late 1923 was among the most tumultuous times of the Weimar Republic, bringing the peak of hyperinflation and the ongoing Occupation of the Ruhr. One of Emminger's main goals as a politician and lawyer became a revaluation of the currency to partially offset the adverse social consequences of hyperinflation. As a minister he prevented the planned Aufwertungsverbot from becoming law and continued to fight for revaluation as a Reichstag delegate.

Emminger left office on 15 April 1924 and his Secretary of State, Curt Joël, took over as acting Minister of Justice. He remained a member of the Rechtsausschuss of the Reichstag and 1927-31 served as chairman of the Zentralvorstand der deutsch-österreichischen Arbeitsgemeinschaft which worked towards a harmonisation of German and Austrian laws. He also contributed to a reform of the criminal law.

Emminger was re-elected to the Reichstag in 1933 but the Nazi takeover ended his political activities. He worked as a judge at the Oberste Landesgericht of Bavaria in 1931-35 and then at the Oberlandesgericht. From 1946 until his retirement in July 1949, he was Senatspräsident there.

Emminger died in Munich on 30 August 1951.

"Associated Co-operative Creameries

Associated Co-operative Creameries (ACC), formerly CWS Milk Group, was a subsidiary and operating division of the Co-operative Group.

Associated Co-operative Creameries Limited is an industrial and provident society that was first registered in 1961,
and became a subsidiary of the North Eastern Co-operative Society (NECS), a large regional consumer co-operative based in Gateshead.
It became one of the largest milk processors and distributors in north-east England.
After NECS merged with the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS, now the Co-operative Group) in 1992, Associated Co-operative Creameries absorbed CWS Milk Group, a milk processor and distributor based in Wales and north west England.  The abbreviated trading name ACC was adopted in 2001 when the milk and distribution operations were split.

By 2004, Associated Co-operative Creameries Limited, trading as ACC Milk, was the UK's fourth largest dairy business, when it was sold to yet another co-operative, Dairy Farmers of Britain of Nantwich, Cheshire, forming Britain's largest milk co-operative, and the UK's third largest milk processor.
ACC moved its registered address to Nantwich at that time.

ACC Distribution was the logistics division of The Co-operative Group and supplied not only stores belonging to The Co-operative Group itself but other co-operative societies. ACC Distribution is still owned by the Co-operative Group and is today known as Co-operative Retail Logistics.

"Sundby Church

Sundby Church (Danish: Sundby Kirke) is a Church of Denmark parish church located on Amagerbrogade in Copenhagen, Denmark. Completed in 1870 to designs by Hans Jørgen Holm, it is the oldest church on the northern part of Amager.

History
 
In the middle of the 19th century, Sundby still belonged to the parish of Tårnby but the old village church there was located almost five kilometres away. A local committee was therefore established in 1868 to raise money for the construction of a new church, charging the architect Hans Jørgen Holm with its design. Construction began in 1869 and the new church was consecrated in 1870.

Nathanael's Parish was disjoined from Sundby Parish in 1899.

The church was refurbished by Frederik Zeuthen and Cai Bertelsen in 1963.

Architecture
 

The church has a cruciform plan and is built in red brick to a Neo-Romanseque design. The roof is topped by an octagonal flèche. The chancel faces north-east. Decorations include corner leseness and round arched friezes on the gables.
 
A porch was built at the nave's south-west gable in 1941. Its tympanum and bronze door were designed by the artist Max Andersen. The bronze door was installed in 1974 to mark the 100th anniversary of the church. The tympanum's relief is identical to the one above the entrance of Absalon Church on Sønder Boulevard. The six reliefs on the bronze door show scenes associated with the Passion of Christ.

Interior

Sundby Cemetery
Sundby Cemetery (Danish: Sundby Kirkegård) was established in 1872 at a site a little to the south of the church and is the main cemetery for Amager. It consists of an old and a modern section, located on either side of Kastrupvej, with a combined area of 10 hectares. The old section will be decommissioned in 2020.

"Zhu Shijie (painter)

Zhu Shijie (; 1900 - 1990) was a Chinese painter and educator, who is regarded as one of the fathers of Chinese oil painting and an important art educator of his time. Born in Suzhou, Jiangsu province, Zhu began studying painting in 1912 and founded the Suzhou Art Academy in 1922. In the 1920s, Zhu went to Japan and brought back to China the Bauhaus concepts and ideas of practical art. Zhu, along with Yan Wenliang and Hu Cuizhong comprise the “Three Masters of Suzhou”.

Early life

"Rachael Maskell

Rachael Helen Maskell (born 5 July 1972) is a British Labour Co-operative politician serving in Jeremy Corbyn’s Shadow Cabinet since 2020 as Shadow Employment Rights Secretary, succeeding Laura Pidcock, and previously from 2016 to 2017 as Shadow Environment Secretary. She was a Junior Transport Minister under Andy McDonald from 2017 to 2020. She is the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of York Central after retaining the seat for her party at the 2015, 2017, and 2019 general elections.

Education
She graduated from the University of East Anglia with a degree in physiotherapy in 1994.

Background
Maskell became politically active at an early age. When she was a child, her uncle campaigned for the abolition of the death penalty, in addition to serving as an advisor to the Wilson government and as an academic. The Yorker, a York-based student publication, states: ""[he] preferred to live and work amongst his community rather than be without. [H]is approach to politics was her inspiration as a child"".

Career
Maskell worked as a care-worker and physiotherapist in the National Health Service for 20 years. Maskell has also been a trade-union official.

Maskell used her maiden speech to advocate for a new mental health hospital in York to replace the ageing Bootham Park. Speaking of the vision of ""late member for Ebbw Vale"" Aneurin Bevan, she said that ""the growing social and financial inequalities manifest themselves in health inequality, and access to vital services is delayed and even denied as a direct result of the £3 billion structural reorganisation that the previous Government introduced.""

On Wednesday 8 July 2015, Rachael Maskell was one of four Labour MPs elected to the Health Select Committee.

Maskell voted against the Welfare Bill in the House of Commons on 20 July 2015. Maskell made a statement saying ""I have a duty to protect our vulnerable people. I could not stand by and let the most vicious Tory attacks on some of the poorest in our city go unchallenged.""

In September 2015, during the European refugee crisis, Maskell called on the UK to open its doors to refugees; she said ""we can all have a bit more compassion. If it was the other way round and we were in that desperate situation, we would expect somebody to show compassion to us."" Speaking as 20,000 refugees arrived in Munich in one weekend, and as the German Government gets ready to receive 800,000 refugees in 2015; Maskell said that the UK Government must do more. She questioned David Cameron in the House of Commons asking ""what criteria has the Prime Minister used to arrive at a figure of just six refugees per constituency per year?"" She is quoted as saying ""20,000 is not enough and 30,000 is not enough' and that ""We will keep going until we hit our saturation point because what does it matter if we have to wait another week for a hospital visit? Or if our class sizes, are slightly bigger? Or if, our city is slightly fuller? What does it matter, if things are slightly more challenging? If we have to pay a little bit more in to the system?""; in a statement on the crisis, she urged local authorities to help in every way they can and use every space they had to offer to aid people fleeing war in Syria and Northern Iraq, she said ""we are in the midst of a humanitarian crisis that is getting worse, I am incensed that Turkey is hosting over one and a half million refugees and our government says we will open our borders to no more than six men, women and children a year in each constituency.""

Maskell spoke in the Trade-Union Bill 2nd Reading debate on 14 September 2015. She referred the house to her Register of Interests as a member of Unite the Union declared ""I am a proud trade-unionist"" – she subsequently voted against the Bill.

Following a period  working part of the Shadow Defence Team under Shadow Secretary of State for Defence Maria Eagle, Maskell was appointed Shadow Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Secretary as part of the Labour Party's post-Brexit reshuffle. Maskell resigned from her position ahead of the vote on the second reading in the House of Commons European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill 2017 which triggers Article 50 which carried a three-line whip imposed on Labour MPs.

She returned to the Labour front bench on 3 July 2017 as Shadow Rail Minister.

On 5 March 2019, she joined a dozen other Labour MPs on Westminster Bridge, next to the Houses of Parliament, in a protest against Brexit under the banner 'Love Socialism Hate Brexit'.

She was one of 5 Labour MPs to vote against the extension of abortion rights to Northern Ireland, and is a vice chair of the  All-Party parliamentary Pro-life Group. During votes on the same bill, she also abstained  on extending same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland.

Maskell endorsed Clive Lewis in the 2020 Labour Party leadership election. In January 2020, Maskell was returned to the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Employment Rights Secretary, replacing Laura Pidcock who lost her seat in the 2019 general election.

"Eduard Spelterini

Eduard Spelterini (June 2, 1852 – June 16, 1931) was a Swiss pioneer of ballooning and of aerial photography.

Early life 

Spelterini was born in Bazenheid in the Toggenburg area in Switzerland as Eduard Schweizer. His father, Sigmund Schweizer, was an innkeeper. When he was eight years old, the family reportedly moved to northern Italy, to a place near the Swiss-Italian border in the province of Como. Eduard is said to have attended the schools in Lugano. At the age of eighteen, Eduard allegedly went first to Milan and then to Paris to be trained as an opera singer. During this time, he chose the name ""Spelterini"", because to him it sound fancier than ""Schweizer"". His singing career was cut short by a severe case of pneumonia.

In any case, Spelterini turned up in the mid-1870s in Paris, and in 1877 he was licensed by the Académie d'Aérostation météorologique de France as a ballon pilot.

Ascents around the world 

In the 1880s, after having successfully made 17 ascents by himself, Spelterini began to offer commercial rides with passengers. In 1887, he had his first own balloon made by the Surcouf company in Paris, a gas balloon with a volume of 1,500 cubic meters, which he named ""Urania"". The first voyage with this ballon was on October 5, 1887, starting in Vienna. Subsequently, Spelterini moved to the United Kingdom, where he performed together with an American aerial acrobat going by the name of Leona Dare who would perform acrobatic acts suspended under the basket of Spelterini's balloon during the flights. The spectacle, but also Spelterini's often taking journalists for a ride for free ensured them favourable publicity. Together, they toured eastwards through Europe until Moscow, where they parted. Spelterini turned southwards, making ascents in Bucharest, Saloniki, and Athens, before moving to Cairo. After his ascents in spring 1890 over the pyramids of Giza he continued touring, first to Naples, then to Istanbul.

In 1891, Spelterini returned to Switzerland. By that time, he was famous for his ballooning adventures. On July 26, 1891, Spelterini made his first ascent in Switzerland, starting at the Heimplatz in Zurich. The initial skepticism of the people vanished quickly, and his starts soon attracted crowds wherever he turned up: Zurich, Winterthur, St. Gall, Interlaken, Vevey, ... His endeavours also caught the attention of scientists. On various occasions, Spelterini made ascents with scientists solely for the purpose of conducting experiments: with physicists to study the atmosphere, with physicians to study human blood cells at low atmospheric pressure, with geologists to study the earth from above.

Geologist Albert Heim had once proposed to Spelterini to try crossing the Alps by balloon. But he needed a larger balloon for such an endeavour. With the help of sponsors, he was able to buy the ""Wega"", twice as large as ""Urania"" with a volume of 3,260 cubic meters. With it, Heim and Spelterini planned to travel from Sion in the Valais across Uri into the Grisons. But the winds decided otherwise. Despite unfavourable wind conditions, they started on October 3, 1898. The winds drove the balloon across Les Diablerets and then further westwards, across Lake Neuchatel and the Jura Mountains, until they descended near Besançon in France. Much of the trip was made at altitudes between 5000 and 6000 meters above sea level.

In the following years, Spelterini crossed the Alps numerous times with his balloons, in all directions. In 1904, he spent several months in Egypt, and in 1911, he even travelled to South Africa, yet he returned each time to Switzerland.

Aerial photography 

Around 1893, Spelterini had begun to take a camera aboard his balloon and started to take pictures on his flights. It was certainly not easy to photograph with this equipment, weighing between 40 and 60 kilograms, and with a minimum exposure time of 1/30th of a second. But Spelterini brought back stunning photographs of the landscape seen from above that won awards repeatedly at aeronautical expositions in Milan, Paris, Brussels, or Frankfurt. For Albert Heim his photos provided whole new insights about the relief of the Alps. Spelterini presented his photos in slide shows wherever he went, from Stockholm to Cape Town, fascinating his audiences and winning the general acclaim of the press, who reviewed his presentations favorably.

Decline of ballooning 

The outbreak of World War I put an end to Spelterini's travels. Borders were closed, and Spelterini's balloons remained grounded. He retired as an independent gentleman to Coppet near Geneva with his wife Emma (née Karpf), whom he had married on January 28, 1914 in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields in London. But although he was well off financially, his savings diminished in the war years, and what was left of it was eaten up by the post-war inflation. The airplane had surpassed ballooning, nobody cared anymore about his pre-war exploits, and Spelterini was all but forgotten. In 1922, he hired out as a showman at the Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, posing for photos and taking people for short rides in a captive balloon. He detested it. Disappointed, he retired to Zipf near Vöcklabruck in Austria, where he had bought a small house and lived from the sale of the eggs of his 300 chickens. In 1926, he tried a last time to revive his old ballooning adventures. With the financial help of some friends, he started from Zurich in a rented balloon. But he fell unconscious during the voyage; his passengers just barely managed to crash-land the balloon in Vorarlberg. Spelterini returned to Zipf, where he died impoverished and largely unknown in 1931.

"Koch County

Koch County is an administrative division of Northern Liech, South Sudan, covering an area in the center of the state.

The administrative center is the town of Koch.
Large villages include Dhor Wang, Thorial, Duar, Wath-Thier and Bieh.
According to the Sudan Population and Housing Census, 2008, there were 75,000 persons in Koch County.
The population is extremely poor, with widespread illiteracy.
There are serious security concerns.

Between April and November 2010, over 35 people died in the county, many of them civilians, from insurgent attacks.
There were suspicions that General Gatluak Gai, who came from Koch County, was the leader of the forces responsible for these attacks.
As of January 2011 talks were in progress with different people who claimed to represent Gatluak Gai, but the situation was extremely obscure.
On 18 July 2011, Gatluak Gai concluded peace talks with the SPLA.
Three days later he was killed.
His second in command in the ""South Sudan Liberation Army"" rebel group, Marko Chuol Ruei, claimed responsibility for the death, saying Gatluak Gai had told his fighters to ignore the peace agreement.

"Cathedral of St Mary and St Anne

The Cathedral of Saint Mary and Saint Anne (), also known as Saint Mary's Cathedral, The North Cathedral or The North Chapel, is a Roman Catholic cathedral located at the top of Shandon Street in Cork, Ireland. It is the seat of the Bishop of Cork and Ross, and the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cork and Ross. Its name derived from the fact that it encompassed the ecclesiastical parish of St. Mary and the civil parish of St. Anne.

History
The cathedral is both the seat of the Bishop of Cork and Ross, and the parish church for the Cathedral parish which includes the areas of Blarney Street, Shandon and Blackpool. Baptismal records date back to 1731. The parish boundary had also included the areas of Blackpool, Sunday’s Well, Shanakiel, Clogheen, Kerry Pike and Curraghkippane until 1981. (Both chapels of ease to the Cathedral, The Church of the Most Precious Blood, became the parish church of Clogheen/Kerry Pike & The Church of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary became the parish church of Blackpool) 

The cathedral was built during the tenure of Bishop Francis Moylan. Construction began in 1799 on the site of a former church built in the 1730s. The cathedral was dedicated on 22 August 1808 by Archbishop Thomas Bray of Cashel. In his sermon, coadjutor bishop Florence McCarthy D.D. spoke of the ""necessity of social worship, arguing the point from reason, scripture, and tradition."" McCarthy died of typhoid in 1810, contracted while visiting a sick parishioner.

The building was extensively damaged by an act of arson in 1820. George Richard Pain undertook the restoration of the cathedral, enlarging the sanctuary and creating a Chancel Arch. The cathedral re-opened in 1828.

In 1964, at the request of Bishop Cornelius Lucey who wished to fulfil the dream of Bishop Francis Moylan concerning the completion of the cathedral, the sanctuary was extended, a sanctuary tower added, and the internal layout reorganised. These works were completed in 1968. The architects employed were Boyd Barrett and Associates. Ideas and plans for the extension and renovation of the cathedral were discussed as far back as 1931 in an annual blotter book published by the Cathedral parish office during the reign of Bishop Daniel Cohalan.

The most recent large-scale works were completed at the cathedral between 1994 and 1996. The tower and sanctuary were renovated and refurbished, and the high altar, altar rails and side altars were removed. The roof was re-slated and the gothic ceiling was repaired. External stonework of the cathedral was also repointed. The cathedral closed for the duration of the works. It was re-dedicated by Bishop Michael Murphy on 29 September 1996 (shortly before his death in October 1996).

The cathedral celebrated its bicentenary in September 2008.

In 2017 a visitor centre was established underneath the sanctuary of the cathedral, with tours of the Cork Folklore Project's exhibition and work.

Architecture
Designed in early Neo-Gothic Revivalist style, the building combines sandstone with limestone dressings. The tower over the main door was added in 1869, designed by John Benson.

The original altar was fashioned in wood by Italian craftsmen in Lisbon.

The bells were cast in 1870 by John Murphy of Dublin, and were originally hung for change-ringing, however they are now considered 'unringable'.

The modern sanctuary of 1996 was designed by architect Richard Hurley, and is finished in white limestone.

"Danny Overbea

Daniel Dorsey ""Danny"" Overbea (January 3, 1926 – May 11, 1994) was an American rhythm and blues singer, guitarist and songwriter, best known for his songs ""Train, Train, Train"" and ""Forty Cups of Coffee"", which he wrote and recorded in the early 1950s.

Life and career
He was born in Philadelphia, but grew up on the South Side of Chicago where he learned guitar while at DuSable High School.  After serving with the military, he started a professional career as a musician in 1946, initially with the Three Earls in Cleveland, Ohio, before launching a solo career.  After returning to Chicago he made his first recording in 1950, as guest vocalist on saxophonist Eddie Chamblee's ""Every Shut Eye Ain't Sleep"".  He signed as a solo artist to Premium Records, and released his first single, ""Contrary Mary"", in early 1951.  He became a popular club performer, noted for his guitar skills while performing splits, playing behind his back, and with his teeth, many such moves emulating T-Bone Walker (and later adopted by Jimi Hendrix).
 
In 1952, he was spotted by radio DJ Al Benson, who arranged for him to be signed by Chess Records.  His first and most successful record for the company, ""Train, Train, Train"", his own composition, was issued on the Checker subsidiary label in early 1953 and reached number 7 on the Billboard R&B chart.  The song was covered by Buddy Morrow, whose version on RCA Victor reached number 28 on the pop chart.

Overbea became a favorite of leading DJ Alan Freed and appeared on some of Freed's shows as well as maintaining a performing schedule in Chicago clubs.  On his second Checker single, ""Forty Cups of Coffee"", he was backed by the King Kolax Orchestra. A cover version by Ella Mae Morse reached number 26 on the pop chart, and the song was recorded by Bill Haley in 1956.   According to Allmusic, Overbea's first two Checker records were ""essentially rock ‘n’ roll songs before the concept of ‘rock ‘n’ roll’ had even emerged.""

His later records for Checker were less successful, and he interspersed his rockier recordings with ballads in the style of Billy Eckstine, such as ""Sorrento"", which he sang in Italian, ""You're Mine"" (also recorded by The Flamingos), and ""A Toast to Lovers"".  He continued to tour, with Dinah Washington and others, and performed on Alan Freed's shows including the week-long Easter Jubilee of Stars in Brooklyn in April 1955.  After several singles on Checker, Overbea moved in 1956 to the Argo label, another Chess subsidiary specifically established to market pop music.  However, his Argo recordings were not commercially successful, and he left in 1957.  He then recorded for Federal Records in Cincinnati, until 1959, but again with little success.  His last known recordings were for the Apex label in Chicago.

Overbea continued to perform occasionally in Chicago clubs until the 1970s.  He died in Chicago in 1994, aged 68.

"Yam Ah Mee

Yam Ah Mee (, born 2 July 1957) is a former Singaporean civil servant and Chief Executive Director of the People's Association. He shot to fame after Singaporeans took to his monotone voice and expressionless demeanour as the Returning Officer for the General Elections in 2011.

Biography
Yam studied at Hwa Chong Junior College and graduated from the University of New South Wales with a First Class Honours in Engineering and the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Australia, with The Queens Medal in 1980, on a Singapore Armed Forces scholarship. He also has a Masters in Business Administration degree from the National University of Singapore and a Masters in Public Administration degree from Harvard University.

Yam served in the Republic of Singapore Air Force, writing an article in the Military Journal POINTER, rising to be the chief of staff of the air staff  and commanding the ground-based, air-defence systems, including the new Igla short range surface to air missiles,  before retiring as a Brigadier-General and entering the Civil Service.

He joined the Public Service Division in August 1998 and was appointed the Deputy Secretary (Development) and the CEO & Dean of the Civil Service College. He was then posted to the Ministry of Transport as Deputy Secretary (Sea & Air) on 1 June 2004 and was appointed chief executive of Land Transport Authority on 11 May 2005. He was also President of the Singapore Youth Flying Club for 8 years from 1998 to 2006. Yam was honoured in 2008 with the Public Administration (Gold) Medal, a top National Day Award.

On 1 May 2010, Yam was appointed CED-designate of the People's Association and on 1 June 2010 fully assumed the Chief Executive Director (CED) mantle, taking over from the retiring Tan Boon Huat. His appointment as Returning Officer also took effect on 1 June 2010.

Elections

Singaporean general election, 2011
Yam shot to fame during the election results release night/morning, as the Returning Officer (having replaced Tan Boon Huat, who retired). He was noted for his monotoned ""nasal"" voice and expressionless demeanour while reading out the 26 batches of results. Fan pages were soon created on Facebook while the results release was still ongoing. Netizens have also released music videos with clips and remixes of his voice on YouTube. A video of Yam doing the chicken dance with youths from Geylang Serai Community Club also went viral, before it was quickly taken down.

Yam has since explained that his ""robotic"" and ""nasal"" voice is due to an operation he had to remove a fishbone in his larynx, although he has also said, explaining his impassive delivery to The Straits Times, that he ""felt it was important to announce (the election results) clearly, concisely and impartially.""

Singaporean presidential election, 2011
Yam was appointed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong as Returning Officer for the Singapore Presidential Election.
Yam announced the results of the 4 nominated candidates for the Presidential Election on 4:24am (GMT +8).

Hougang SMC by-election, 2012
Yam was named as the Returning Officer for the 2012 Hougang by-election. He delivered the nomination announcement at 12.35 pm on 16 May 2012.

Punggol SMC by-election, 2013
This was Yam's last appearance as the Returning Officer.

Post-elections

After GE 2011
Yam's robotic voice announcing the results for Aljunied GRC had turned into a mix just within a few hours ensuing the elections. Many have taken clips of his voice and mixed it with various styles of music, from electro to dance, on popular video-sharing website YouTube.

Within two days, Yam's Facebook account had reached the 5000 friends limit. Yam thus created an official page for himself ; although non-official pages had already appeared by then.

After a week, he did a ""spoof"" video of himself, in which he announced PAssion Movie Night, held to celebrate a million PAssion Card memberships, in his trademark manner.

Mr. Yam filmed a video in late May, to promote a K-pop dance event on 29 May 2011, to be held at Ngee Ann City.

In less than 24 hours after the release of the presidential election results, a club mix of Yam announcing the results was released on YouTube, by the same user responsible for the earlier club mix of Yam's general elections ""performance"".

Yam starred in a musical held to celebrate the opening of the first 12 stations of the Circle Line, on 2 October.

People's Association
As part of an effort to promote the PA and social cohesion, Yam made appearances at many youth and sporting events, particularly after his rise to fame in the elections.

In January 2013, reports emerged that Yam had resigned from the PA and would leave the organisation by March, to be replaced by Health Promotion Board chief executive Ang Hak Seng. In an interview with RazorTV, he announced plans to pursue a career in the private sector after 36 years in the civil service. He held a farewell party on 28 March 2013 and ended his tenure at the PA on 31 March 2013.

Sembcorp
Yam joined Sembcorp Design and Construction as its managing director on 16 April 2013.

"Listing of historic ships in Sweden

The Maritime Museum in Stockholm is responsible for the listing of historic ships in Sweden (). The purpose of the listing is to encourage and support owners of historic ships and boats to preserve and take care of their vessels. The listing does not confer any legal protection on the vessels or obligations on their owners but entitles them to some privileges.

Ships and pleasure boats
Historic ships and boats can be listed  in either of two categories: Listed historical ships or Listed historical pleasure boats. The purpose of listing vessels is similar in both cases; it is done in order to ""make them better recognized, preserved and used"". In addition, the listing aims to encourage conscious private cultural heritage ownership and management. Owners of listed ships are entitled to display a plaque that confirms the ship's listed status on board, and pleasure boats are equipped with a similar enamel sign.

While the listing does not confer any legal protection on the ships – in contrast to listed buildings – the Maritime Museum notes that listed ships and boats under some circumstances enjoy reduced harbour fees and listed pleasure boats sometimes enjoy various benefits by harbours, canals, dockyards and boat clubs. For example, a news item from 2013 notes that at  on Djurgården in central Stockholm, listed boats and ships may berth for a short period of time free of charge if they agree to let visitors come aboard. Listed pleasure boats are also e.g. exempted from a national ban on letting out toilet waste into the surrounding water. The museum is also responsible for providing financial aid to the restoration of culturally significant private ships and boats, and while there is no direct connection between owning a listed vessel and receiving aid, the Maritime Museum has concluded that many owners of listed ships have voiced the opinion that an important way to facilitate the management of listed ships is to increase this financial support. Some owners of listed pleasure boats have voiced that the listing has attracted attention to them and their boats from other boat owners, boat clubs, and in maritime festivals and competitions, as well as from local papers and radio channels.

Commercial and utility ships have been listed since 2001, and pleasure boats since 2009. Sweden was the first country in Europe to list pleasure boats.

The museum made an evaluation of its listing of ships in 2014, and of the listing of pleasure boats in 2017.

Listing of ships
For a ship to be eligible for inclusion on the historic ship list, it must meet the following criteria:
 It has to be at least  long and  wide.
 It has to be at least 50 years old or of such an age and character that it can be deemed significant from a cultural perspective.
 It was built or constructed in Sweden, or was registered in Sweden for a prolonged period or else deemed to be of very high value for the promotion of knowledge about the maritime history of Sweden.
 Commercial and utility vessels smaller than 12 by 4 metres can be eligible if there are special reasons.

The owner of the ship submits an application to the museum containing, among other things, an account of the ship's history and its present state of preservation. The museum then makes an assessment based on seven criteria, taken from the handbook of assessing listed buildings issued by the Swedish National Heritage Board and adopted to maritime conditions. Listed ships are graded by the museum between I and III, where I represents the highest grade of cultural value.

Listing of pleasure boats
The following criteria must to be fulfilled for a boat to be eligible for listing by the museum:
 The boat was originally built as a pleasure craft.
 The boat was built in Sweden; or designed by a Swedish boat constructor; or is of a model which has been popular in Sweden; or in some other way considered important to preserve from a cultural perspective.
 It was built before 1965; boats constructed later may be considered for listing if they are large and have extraordinary cultural significance.
 The boat's history must be well-documented.
 It must be in a good and seaworthy condition. Repairs and alterations must have been made in a considerate way.
 The boat must not be a copy or reproduction of another vessel.
 Only individual boats are considered eligible, not entire series or models of boats.

The owner of the boat may apply twice a year to have the boat listed. If a boat is listed and at a later point sold, the museum asks the owner to provide contact details to the new owner of the pleasure craft in order to be able to maintain knowledge about the fate of these boats.

Traditional-ship classification
The Maritime Museum also conducts Traditional-ship classification (T-classing) of ships of historic value. The classification is aimed at guaranteeing the seaworthiness of the ship while maintaining its historic value and allows older ships to obtain certificates needed in order to sail in international waters.

"National Route 101 (Argentina)

National Route 101 is a national road in the NW of Misiones Province, Argentina ending at Iguazu National Park. It runs for  near the border between Argentina and Brazil crossing the  Missiones Province Departments of General Manuel Belgrano and Iguazú.

After decades of difficult travel through this road, especially after rains, it was decided to pave it starting from the south end. The work was contracted with a financial agreement with the federal government and under the technical supervision and administration of the Dirección Provincial de Vialidad (Provincial Dept. of Transportation).

In 2006 the Dirección Provincial de Vialidad paved the section between Bernardo de Irigoyen and San Antonio. The next  until the rural area known as Piñalito Norte were completed in mid-2007. The section between Piñalito Norte and Provincial Route 19 is under construction. The following  until Puerto Iguazú International Airport is unpaved, while the section from the airport to the junction with National Route 12 is paved.

"Sally Mann

Sally Mann HonFRPS  (born May 1, 1951) is an American photographer, widely known for her large-format, black-and-white photographs—at first of her young children, then later of landscapes suggesting decay and death.

Early life and education
Born in Lexington, Virginia, Mann was the third of three children. Her father, Robert S. Munger, was a general practitioner, and her mother, Elizabeth Evans Munger, ran the bookstore at Washington and Lee University in Lexington. Mann was raised by an atheist and compassionate father who allowed Mann to be ""benignly neglected"". Mann was introduced to photography by her father, who encouraged her interest in photography; his 5x7 camera became the basis of her use of large format cameras today.  Mann began to photograph when she was sixteen. Most of her photographs and writings are tied to Lexington, Virginia. Mann graduated from The Putney School in 1969, and attended Bennington College and Friends World College. She earned a BA, summa cum laude, from Hollins College (now Hollins University) in 1974 and a MA in creative writing in 1975.
She took up photography at Putney where, she claims, her motive was to be alone in the darkroom with her boyfriend. She made her photographic debut at Putney with an image of a nude classmate. Mann has never had any formal training in photography and  she ""never read[s] about photography"".

Early career
After graduation from Hollins College, Mann worked as a photographer at Washington and Lee University. In the mid-1970s she photographed the construction of its new law school building, the Lewis Hall (now the Sydney Lewis Hall), leading to her first solo exhibition in late 1977 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC The Corcoran Gallery of Art published a catalogue of Mann's images  titled ""The Lewis Law Portfolio"". Some of those surrealistic images were also included as part of her first book, Second Sight, published in 1984. While Mann explored a variety of genres as she was maturing in the 1970s, she truly found her trade with her book, At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women (Aperture, 1988).

In 1995, she was featured in an issue of ""Aperture"". On Location with: Henri Cartier-Bresson, Graciela Iturbide, Barbara Kruger, Sally Mann, Andres Serrano, Clarissa Sligh"" which was illustrated with photographs.

At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women

Her second collection, At Twelve: Portraits of Young Women, published in 1988, stimulated minor controversy. The images “captured the confusing emotions and developing identities of adolescent girls [and the] expressive printing style lent a dramatic and brooding mood to all of her images”. In the preface to the book, Ann Beattie says “when a girl is twelve years old, she often wants – or says she wants – less involvement with adults. […] [it is] a time in which the girls yearn for freedom and adults feel their own grip on things becoming a little tenuous, as they realize that they have to let their children go.” Beattie says that Mann's photographs don't “glamorize the world, but they don’t make it into something more unpleasant than it is, either”. The girls photographed in this series are shown “vulnerable in their youthfulness” but Mann instead focuses on the strength that the girls possess.

In one image from the book (shown to the right), Mann says that the young girl was extremely reluctant to stand closer to her mother's boyfriend. Mann said that she thought it was strange because “it was their peculiar familiarity that had provoked this photograph in the first place”. Mann didn't want to crop out the girl's elbow but the girl refused to move in closer. According to Mann, the girl's mother shot her boyfriend in the face with a .22 several months later. In court the mother “testified that while she worked nights at a local truck stop he was ‘at home partying and harassing my daughter.’” Mann said “the child put it to me somewhat more directly”. Mann says that she now looks at this photograph with “a jaggy chill of realization”.

Immediate Family and controversy

Mann is widely known for Immediate Family, her third collection, first exhibited in 1990 by Edwynn Houk Gallery in Chicago and published as a monograph in 1992. The New York Times said, “Probably no photographer in history has enjoyed such a burst of success in the art world”. The book consists of 65 black-and-white photographs of her three children, all under the age of 10. Many of the pictures were taken at the family's remote summer cabin along the river, where the children played and swam in the nude. Many explore typical childhood themes (skinny dipping, reading the funnies, dressing up, vamping, napping, playing board games) but others touch on darker themes such as insecurity, loneliness, injury, sexuality and death. The controversy on its release was intense, including accusations of child pornography (both in America and abroad) and of contrived fiction with constructed tableaux.

One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong”. He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov's article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that this is the kind of thing that shouldn’t be shown”.  Mann claimed that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” Mann responded to the criticisms saying she did not plan the photographs and that when she was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.

Many of her other photographs containing her nude or hurt children caused controversy. For example, in The Perfect Tomato, the viewer sees a nude Jessie, posing on a picnic table outside, bathed in light. Jessie told Steven Cantor during the filming of one of his movies that she had just been playing around and her mother told her to freeze, and she tried to capture the image in a rush because the sun was setting. This explains why everything is blurred except for the tomato, hence the photograph's title. This image was likely criticized for Jessie's nudity and presentation of the adolescent female form. While Jessie was aware of this photograph, Dana Cox, in her essay, said that the Mann children were probably unaware of the other photographs being taken as Mann's children were often naked because “it came natural to them”. This habit of nudity is a family thing because Mann says she used to walk around her house naked when she was growing up. Cox states that “the own artist’s childhood is reflected in the way she captures moments in her children’s lives”. One image that deals more with another aspect of childhood besides ""naked play"", Jessie's Cut, shows Jessie's head, wrapped in what appears to be plastic, with blood running down the side of her face from the cut above her left eye. The cut is stitched and the blood is dry and stains her skin. As painful as the image looks, there are a great number of viewers who could relate to Jessie when they think about the broken bones and stitched up cuts they had during childhood.

Mann herself considered these photographs to be “natural through the eyes of a mother, since she has seen her children in every state: happy, sad, playful, sick, bloodied, angry and even naked”. Critics agreed, saying her “vision in large measure [is] accurate, and a welcome corrective to familiar notions of youth as a time of unalloyed sweetness and innocence”, and that the book “created a place that looked like Eden, then cast upon it the subdued and shifting light of nostalgia, sexuality and death"".<ref>Lyle Rexer, “Art/Architecture; Marriage Under Glass: Intimate Exposures”, ‘’The New York Times, November 10, 2000. ART/ARCHITECTURE - Marriage Under Glass - Intimate Exposures - NYTimes.com</ref> When Time magazine named her “America’s Best Photographer” in 2001, it wrote:

Mann recorded a combination of spontaneous and carefully arranged moments of childhood repose and revealingly — sometimes unnervingly — imaginative play. What the outraged critics of her child nudes failed to grant was the patent devotion involved throughout the project and the delighted complicity of her son and daughters in so many of the solemn or playful events. No other collection of family photographs is remotely like it, in both its naked candor and the fervor of its maternal curiosity and care.The New Republic considered it ""one of the great photograph books of our time"".

Despite the controversy, Mann was never charged with the taking or selling of child pornography, even though, according to Edward de Grazia, law professor and civil liberties expert, “any federal prosecutor anywhere in the country could bring a case against [Mann] in Virginia, and not only seize her photos, her equipment, her Rolodexes, but also seize her children for psychiatric and physical examination”. Before she published Immediate Family, she consulted a Virginian federal prosecutor who told her that some of the images she was exhibiting could have her arrested. In 1991, she initially decided to postpone the publication of the book. In an interview with New York Times reporter, Richard Woodward, she said “I thought the book could wait 10 years, when the kids won’t be living in the same bodies. They’ll have matured and they’ll understand the implications of the pictures. I unilaterally decided.” The children apparently did not like this decision and Mann and her husband arranged for Emmett and Jessie to talk to a psychologist to be sure their feelings were honest, and so that they understood what the publication would do. Each child was then allowed to vote on which photographs were to be put in the book.

To further protect the children from “teasing”, Mann told Woodward that she wanted to keep copies of Immediate Family out of their home town of Lexington. She asked bookstores in the area not to sell it and for libraries to keep it in their rare-book rooms. Dr. Aaron Esman, a child psychiatrist at the Payne Whitney Clinic believes that Mann is serious about her work and that she has “no intention to jeopardize her children or use them for pornographic images”. He says that the nude photographs don't appear to be erotically stimulating to anyone but a “case-hardened pedophile or a rather dogmatic religious fundamentalist”. Mann stated, ""I didn't expect the controversy over the pictures of my children. I was just a mother photographing her children as they were growing up. I was exploring different subjects with them.""

Her fourth book, Still Time, published in 1994, was based on the catalogue of a traveling exhibition that included more than 20 years of her photography. The 60 images included more photographs of her children, but also earlier landscapes with color and abstract photographs.

Later career
In the mid-1990s, Mann began photographing landscapes on wet plate collodion 8x10 inch glass negatives, and used the same 100 year-old 8x10 format bellows view camera that she had used for all the previous bodies of work. These landscapes were first seen in Still Time, and later featured in two shows presented by the Edwynn Houk Gallery in NYC: Sally Mann – Mother Land: Recent Landscapes of Georgia and Virginia in 1997, and then in Deep South: Landscapes of Louisiana and Mississippi in 1999. Many of these large (40""x50"") black-and-white and manipulated prints were taken using the 19th century “wet plate” process, or collodion, in which glass plates are coated with collodion, dipped in silver nitrate, and exposed while still wet. This gave the photographs what the New York Times called “a swirling, ethereal image with a center of preternatural clarity"", and showed many flaws and artifacts, some from the process and some introduced by Mann. Filmmaker Steven Cantor directed two films about Mann's life: Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann (1994) was nominated for an Oscar for best documentary short, and What Remains: The Life and Work of Sally Mann premiered on television in 2007.

Mann uses antique view cameras from the early 1890s. These cameras have wooden frames, accordion-like bellows and long lenses made out of brass, now held together by tape that has mold growing inside. This sort of camera, when used with vintage lenses, softens the light, which makes the pictures timeless.

Mann's fifth book, What Remains, published in 2003, is based on the show of the same name at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, DC. The book is broken up into four sections: Matter Lent, December 8, 2000,  Antietam, and What Remains. The first section contains photographs of the remains of Eva, her greyhound, after decomposition, along with the photographs of dead and decomposing bodies at a federal forensic anthropology facility (known as the ‘body farm’). The second part details the site on her property where an armed escaped convict was killed in a shootout with police. The third part is a study of the grounds of Antietam, the site of the bloodiest single day battle in American history during the Civil War. The fourth part is a study of close-up faces of her children. Thus, this study of mortality, decay and death ends with hope and love.

Mann's sixth book, Deep South, published in 2005, with 65 black-and-white images, includes landscapes taken from 1992 to 2004 using both conventional 8x10 film and wet plate collodion. These photographs have been described as “haunted landscapes of the south, battlefields, decaying mansion, kudzu shrouded landscapes and the site where Emmett Till was murdered"". Newsweek picked it as their book choice for the holiday season, saying that Mann “walks right up to every Southern stereotype in the book and subtly demolishes each in its turn by creating indelibly disturbing images that hover somewhere between document and dream"".

Mann's seventh book, Proud Flesh, published in 2009, is a study taken over six years of the effects of muscular dystrophy on her husband Larry Mann. Mann photographed her husband using the collodion wet plate process As she notes, ""The results of this rare reversal of photographic roles are candid, extraordinarily wrenching and touchingly frank portraits of a man at his most vulnerable moment."" The project was displayed in Gagosian Gallery in October 2009.

Mann's eighth book, The Flesh and The Spirit, published in 2010, was released in conjunction with a comprehensive show at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia. Regarding this exhibition, the museum director stated, ""She follows her own voice. Her pictures are imbued with an amazing degree of soul."" Though not strictly a retrospective, this 200-page book included new and recent work (unpublished self-portraits, landscapes, images of her husband, her children's faces, and of the dead at a forensic institute) as well as early works (unpublished color photographs of her children in the 1990s, color Polaroids, and platinum prints from the 1970s). Its unifying theme is the body, with its vagaries of illnesses and death, and includes essays by John Ravenal, David Levi Strauss, and Anne Wilkes Tucker.

In May 2011 she delivered the three-day Massey Lecture Series at Harvard. In June 2011, Mann sat down with one of her contemporaries, Nan Goldin, at Look3 Charlottesville Festival of the Photograph. The two photographers discussed their respective careers, particularly the ways in which photographing personal lives became a source of professional controversy. This was followed by an appearance at the University of Michigan as part of the Penny W. Stamps lecture series.

Mann's ninth book, Hold Still: A Memoir with Photographs, released May 12, 2015, is a melding of a memoir of her youth, an examination of some major influences of her life, and reflections on how photography shapes one's view of the world. It is augmented with numerous photographs, letters, and other memorabilia. She singles out her ""near-feral"" childhood and her subsequent introduction to photography at Putney, her relationship to her husband of 40 years and his parent's mysterious death, and her maternal Welsh relative's nostalgia for land morphing into her love for her land in the Shenandoah Valley, as some of her important influences. Gee-Gee, a black woman who was a surrogate parent, who opened Mann's eyes to race relations and exploitation, her relationship with local artist Cy Twombly, and her father's genteel southern legacy and his eventual death are also examined. The New York Times described it as ""an instant classic among Southern memoirs of the last 50 years"". An article by Mann adapted from this book appeared with photographs in The New York Times Magazine in April 2015. Hold Still was a finalist for the 2015 National Book Award.

Mann's tenth book, Remembered Light: Cy Twombly in Lexington was published in 2016. It is an insider's photographic view of Cy Twombly's studio in Lexington. It was published concurrently with an exhibit of color and black-and-white photographs at the Gagosian Gallery. It shows the overflow of Twombly's general modus operandi: the leftovers, smears, and stains, or, as Simon Schama said in his essay at the start of the book, ""an absence turned into a presence"".

Mann's eleventh book, Sally Mann: A Thousand Crossings, authored by Sarah Greenough and Sarah Kennel, is a large (320 pages) compendium of works spanning 40 years, with 230 photographs by Mann. It served as a catalog for an exhibit at the National Gallery of Art entitled Sally Mann: A Thousand Crossings which opened March 4, 2018 and was the first major survey of the artist's work to travel internationally.

In her recent projects, Mann has started exploring the issues of race and legacy of slavery that were a central theme of her memoir Hold Still. They include a series of portraits of black men, all made during one-hour sessions in the studio with models not previously known to her. Mann was inspired by Bill T. Jones' use of the Walt Whitman 1856 poem ""Poem of the Body"" in his art, and Mann ""borrowed the idea, using the poem as a template for [her] own exploration"". Several pictures from this body of work were highlighted in Aperture Foundation magazine in the summer of 2016. and they also appeared in A Thousand Crossings. This book and exhibit also introduced a series of photographs of African American historic churches photographed on expired film, and a series of tintype photographs of a swamp that served as refuge for escaped slaves. Some critics see in Mann's work a deep working through of the legacy of white violence in the South, while others have voiced concern that Mann's work at times repeats rather than critiques tropes of white domination and violence in the American southeast.

Personal life
Mann, born and raised in Virginia, is the daughter of Robert Munger and Elizabeth Munger. In Mann's introduction for her book Immediate Family, she ""expresses stronger memories for the black woman, Virginia Carter, who oversaw her upbringing than for her own mother"". Elizabeth Munger was not a big part of Mann's life, and Elizabeth said “Sally may look like me, but inside she’s her father’s child.” Virginia (Gee-Gee) Carter, born in 1894, raised Mann and her two brothers and was an admirable woman. “Left with six children and a public education system for which she paid taxes but which forbade classes for black children beyond the seventh grade, Gee-Gee managed somehow to send each of them to out-of-state boarding schools and, ultimately, to college.” Virginia Carter died in 1994.

In 1969 Sally met Larry Mann, and in 1970 they married. Larry Mann is an attorney and, before practicing law, he was a blacksmith. Larry was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy around 1996. They live together in their home which they built on Sally's family's farm in Lexington, Virginia.

They have three children together: Emmett (b.1979), who took his own life in 2016, after a life-threatening car collision and a subsequent battle with schizophrenia, and who for a time served in the Peace Corps; Jessie (b.1981), who herself is an artist and was a candidate for an advanced degree in neurobiology, and whose heroes include Helen Keller, Martin Luther King Jr, and Madonna; and Virginia (b.1985), now a lawyer.

She is passionate about endurance horse racing. In 2006, her Arabian horse ruptured an aneurysm while she was riding him. In the horse's death throes, Mann was thrown to the ground, the horse rolled over her, and the impact broke her back. It took her two years to recover from the accident and during this time, she made a series of ambrotype self-portraits. These self-portraits were on view for the first time in November 2010 at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts as a part of Sally Mann: the Flesh and the Spirit.

Recognition
Her works are included in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the Museum of Fine Arts, in Boston, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of New York City among many others.

Time magazine named Mann ""America's Best Photographer"" in 2001. Photos she took have appeared on the cover of The New York Times Magazine twice: first, a picture of her three children for the September 27, 1992 issue with a feature article on her ""disturbing work"", and again on September 9. 2001, with a self-portrait (which also included her two daughters) for a theme issue on ""Women Looking at Women"".

Mann has been the subject of two film documentaries. The first, Blood Ties, was directed by Steve Cantor, debuted at the 1994 Sundance Film Festival, and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Documentary Short. The second, What Remains  was also directed by Steve Cantor. It premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for an Emmy for Best Documentary in 2008. In her New York Times review of the film, Ginia Bellafante wrote, ""It is one of the most exquisitely intimate portraits not only of an artist’s process, but also of a marriage and a life, to appear on television in recent memory.""

Mann received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the Corcoran College of Art + Design in May 2006. The Royal Photographic Society (UK) awarded her an Honorary Fellowship in 2012.

Mann won the 2016 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction for Hold Still: A Memoir in Photographs.

"Cartoon violence

Cartoon violence is the representation of violent actions involving animated characters and situations. This may include violence where a character is unharmed after the action has been inflicted. Animated violence is sometimes partitioned into comedic and non-comedic cartoon violence.

Influence on real-life behavior
Opinions on the influences of cartoon violence vary. Some researchers believe that high level of violence in cartoons can make children more aggressive. Their studies also found that young children tend to mimic the negative behavior they see on television. Output aimed at children as young as seven, which include a number of cartoons, had the highest levels of violence. Researchers also concluded across the early and middle childhood, laboratory experiments using cartoons with comedic violence have consistently failed to demonstrate significant differences in person-oriented aggression. In contrast, field experiments have consistently shown that aggressive behavior towards peers increases following the viewing of non-comedic violent cartoons.

Other researchers believe that people need to consider the ways in which children process information, the amount of mental effort they invest, and their own life experience to gain an understanding of how television violence affects children. For instance, recent research has indicated that children do not appear to mimic acts of violence in the media, whether television or cartoons.

Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz argue that children possess the ability to differentiate real life from animation, as well as the ability to understand right from wrong. They know that violent acts qualify as immoral and infringe on the welfare of others, therefore the violence witnessed in cartoons will register as ""make believe"" to children and will not be applied into their real lives.

Options for parents and restriction
There are a number of ways parents can control their children’s exposure to violence. One of the most effective and common ways of prevention is restricting the number and types of programs children watch. With older children, parents might want to discuss, and explain television. This can help children to understand television material and overcome the effect TV violence has on their outlook and behaviors.

Three initiatives have been put in place to combat violence in cartoons (). The first is The Children's Television Act which requires broadcasters to air shows which are educational and provide information for the children. The second initiative is the V-chip legislation that gives parents the opportunity to block out violent shows from their television. The third legislation against violent cartoons is the National Cable Television Association’s TV Parental Guidelines, which is a system that rates the Television shows based on their contents.

In action-adventure oriented cartoons, the most consistent avenue of addressing violence is the use of a form of fantasy violence in which no one is injured or killed on screen. In science fiction cartoons, for example, enemy forces are typically said to be robots so that they may be destroyed in bulk by the heroes without concern over killing living beings. In cases where vehicles are known to be piloted by living beings, tanks, aircraft, and other war vehicles that are destroyed in combat always allow time for the pilot to escape or bail out. Realistic firearms are often replaced with futuristic beam weapons which still seldom hit anyone. Swords and other bladed weapons may be prohibited from being used as offensive weapons but may be used defensively or be depicted as magical weapons. Direct violence is frequently limited to hand to hand combat where directly kicking or punching another character may or may not be allowed. The majority of action adventure cartoons over the past decades have used these methods of depicting dynamic action scenes although their use has been heavily criticized as ""sanitized violence"". Cartoons based on the Voltron, Transformers, G.I. Joe, and Masters of the Universe franchises (especially the versions produced during the 1980s) are notable examples using variations on fantasy violence.

Victor C. Strasburger, Amy B. Jordan and Ed Donnerstein, writing in Pediatrics, say that parents should limit the total screen time for children older than two years of age to no more than one to two hours per day. Children under two years of age should avoid watching television altogether. Televisions should be kept out of children’s bedrooms and parents should watch television with their children and discuss the content.

Health practitioners can also play their part by taking the time to ask their young patients how much time per day they spend with entertainment media and if there is a television or computer with Internet access in their bedroom.

Effects

Effects of cartoon violence on youth remain controversial. Research has generally been divided on this issue with no consensus reached regarding the effects of violence on behavior. F.C. Blumberg, K.P. Bierwirth, and A.J. Schwartz, in a 2008 paper in Early Childhood Education Journal, say that the impact of exposure to violence may remain regardless of whether children choose to imitate it.

"Northern Army (Home Forces)

Northern Army was a home service formation of the British Army during the First World War, responsible for the defence of East Anglia.

It was formed on 11 April 1916 under the command of Sir Bruce Hamilton, with headquarters at Mundford. The Army was composed of 1st Cyclist Division, 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division, 64th (2nd Highland) Division and four provisional brigades (3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th), with 68th (2nd Welsh) Division attached for training purposes. The Army was disbanded on 16 February 1918.

"Norwegian Entomological Society

The Norwegian Entomological Society (, NEF) was established in 1904. The purpose of the society is to promote interest in and the study of entomology in Norway and to establish contact between the interested parties. The society is open to both amateurs and experts. Anyone with an interest in insects or other arthropod groups can become a member.

Local branches of the society are located in the largest Norwegian cities, and they organize excursions to particularly interesting sites and guides, who offer advice connected with identifying species and preparing collected material.

History
The society was founded by ten enthusiasts; none of them were entomologists by profession, but two were biologists. All of them shared an interest in insects. Thomas Georg Münster originally came up with the initiative, and he served as the society's first chairman. The following year, two more members joined the society and it received its first charter. Work with butterflies and beetles occupied the society's members during its early years.

Institutions were allowed to become members of the society in 1921, the first one being the Norwegian College of Agricultural in Ås. in 1922 the society started admitting individual members from abroad. Membership of the society gradually grew, and in 1930 there were about 40 individual members. The society had about 400 members in 2008. The society is open to anyone that would like to be a member.

This has not always been the case; previously, another member had to recommend individuals for membership in the society, and membership was approved after assessment by the board. For example, Arne Semb-Johansson became a member in 1939 at the recommendation of Fridthjof Økland. In the process, he received a letter from Leif Reinhardt Natvig, stating: ""Through Dr. Økland I have been informed that you would like to become a member of the Norwegian Entomological Society. To that end, I am bound to obtain some information from you: date of birth, place of birth, position, and which insect group you collect or are especially interested in. I will then present the matter at the society's next board meeting. Yours, Leif Reinhardt Natvig."" Later Semb-Johansson received a second letter: ""I have the honor to inform you that you have been admitted as a member of the Norwegian Entomological Society.""

Surveying insects in Norway
In order to be able to survey the prevalence of Norwegian insects, a simple geographical system for locating sightings was needed. In 1924, Thomas Georg Münster and others created a system that divided Norway into bio-geographical sectional areas for botanists and zoologists using number codes. Eventually it turned out that this was little used.

In 1943, Andreas Strand came up with a new system called Inndeling av Norge til bruk ved faunistiske oppgaver (Division of Norway for Use in Fauna Tasks), popularly known as the Strand System. In it, Norway was divided into 37 regions based on municipal and county boundaries, and it took into account that the fauna in the interior parts of the country differed from the fauna on the coast. Therefore, most Norwegian counties are divided into smaller areas (e.g., inner, outer, north, or south). Strand chose letter codes instead of numbers; for example, HOY is the code for outer Hordaland (Hordaland, ytre).

The system was revised in 1981 by Karen Anna Økland because the municipal boundaries had also been revised. This system is recommended by the society and is used in all publications.

Since the 1960s, UTM coordinates have routinely been used for mapping species.

Since 1978, the European Invertebrate Survey (EIS) system has been recommended. In this system, Europe is divided into squares of . In a separate limited system for Norway, the squares are adapted to the Norwegian map and numbered from 1 to 189. For example, Oslo is in the square designated EIS 28. This gives the Norwegian map a grid that is well suited for demarcating a species' distribution.

In May 2008, the Norwegian Species Observation System (Artsobservasjoner) was launched; this is an internet-based service where sightings can be published. The Norwegian Entomological Society is one of five organizations working with the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre (Artsdatabanken) to operate the website.

Journal and other publications
There were no Norwegian entomological journals in the early years. The first publications by Norwegian entomologists appeared in the Swedish Entomologisk Tidskrift (Entomological Journal), which was not unexpected because Norway was in a union with Sweden. Other articles also appeared in series published by the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters and in Nyt Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne (New Journal for the Natural Sciences). This situation was not satisfactory, and the first issue of Norsk Entomologisk Tidsskrift (now Norwegian Journal of Entomology) appeared in May 1921.
Norwegian Journal of Entomology is the association's research journal, and it is sent to all members. It is issued twice a year. The journal has been published since 1921; it was originally called Norsk Entomologisk Tidsskrift and it has changed its name several times. Back issues are posted online and can be read at the Norwegian Entomological Society's website.
Catalogus Coleopterorum Daniae et Fennoscandiae (Register of Beetles of Denmark and Fennoscandia) inventoried beetles and was published in 1939. It was the first complete register of the distribution of a group of insects in Norway.
Atalanta norvegica (The Norwegian Atalanta) was published from 1967 to 1983, and it was a companion publication to the Norwegian Journal of Entomology. It was dedicated to the study of Norwegian butterflies. The journal is no longer published, but it can be read on the Norwegian Entomological Society's website.
Insekt-Nytt (Insect News) is written in a popular science style and is the society's members' magazine. It was first published in 1976, and it appears four times a year. It contains material on collection and preparation, literature on Norwegian insects, brief presentations of insects or insect groups, and new discoveries. Other arthropod groups such as arachnids are also covered in the magazine. Issues of the magazine over five years old can be read on the Norwegian Entomological Society's website.
Insecta norvegiae (Insects of Norway) is a journal that publishes major works such as individual volumes, checklists, bibliographies, and so on. It is published at iregular intervals.
Norske Insekttabeller (Norwegian Insect Tables) is a series of inexpensive Norwegian-language booklets with identification tables for smaller groups of Norway's insect fauna. All the booklets are available on the Norwegian Entomological Society's website.
Catalogus Lepidopterorum Norvegiae (Register of Norwegian Butterflies) appeared in 2002, and it is based on about 125,000 sightings of butterflies in Norway. Its information is available in a searchable database.

"The Departed

The Departed is a 2006 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by William Monahan. It is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs. The Departed stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, and Mark Wahlberg, with Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone, Vera Farmiga, and Alec Baldwin in supporting roles.

The film takes place in Boston. Irish Mob boss Francis ""Frank"" Costello (Nicholson) plants Colin Sullivan (Damon) as a mole within the Massachusetts State Police; simultaneously, the police assign undercover state trooper William ""Billy"" Costigan (DiCaprio) to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, Sullivan and Costigan each attempt to discover the other's identity before they are found out. The character Colin Sullivan is loosely based on the corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, while the character Frank Costello is based on gangster Whitey Bulger.

The Departed was a critical and commercial success, and won several awards, including four Oscars at the 79th Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing; Mark Wahlberg was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor.

Plot 

In 1970s South Boston, young Colin Sullivan is introduced to crime by Irish-American mob boss Frank Costello. By 2006, Costello has groomed him as a mole inside the Massachusetts State Police (MSP). Sullivan is accepted into its Special Investigations Unit, which targets organized crime. Before graduating from the MSP's academy, William ""Billy"" Costigan Jr. is recruited by Captain Queenan and Staff Sergeant Dignam to go undercover, as his family's ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. His cover story is that he is an MSP academy dropout who served time in prison on a (fake) assault charge; he subsequently joins Costello's crew.

Sullivan begins a romance with police psychiatrist Madolyn Madden. Costigan also sees her as a condition of his probation, and they begin a relationship as well. After Costello escapes a sting operation, each mole becomes aware of the other's existence. Sullivan is promoted to the State Police's Internal Investigations unit and tasked with finding the rat. Costigan follows Costello into a porn theater, where Costello gives Sullivan an envelope containing personal information on his crew members. Costigan chases Sullivan through Chinatown, but neither man sees the other's face.

Sullivan later has Queenan tailed to a meeting with Costigan on the roof of an empty building. Costello's men arrive, and Queenan makes Costigan leave to preserve his cover before confronting them alone. They drop Queenan to his death before engaging in a brief shootout with police. Crew member Delahunt subsequently dies from a gunshot wound, after telling Costigan he knew he was the informant. Television news states that Delahunt had been an undercover cop, but Costello recognizes this as a ploy to protect the real informant. With Queenan dead, a furious Dignam is ordered to take a leave of absence after a fight with Sullivan, but he resigns instead.

Using Queenan's phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns from Queenan's diary that Costello is a protected FBI informant, causing him to worry about his own identity being revealed (meanwhile, Costigan also learns Costello is an FBI informant from a bank robber he is sent to brutalise). With Costigan's help, Costello is traced to a cocaine drop-off, where a gunfight erupts between the crew and the police. Most of the crew are killed. Costello, confronted by Sullivan, admits he is an FBI informant, and Sullivan kills him.

With the operation wrapped up, Costigan goes to Sullivan to restore his true identity, but he notices the envelope from Costello on Sullivan's desk, realizes he's Costello's mole and flees. Recognizing Costigan's revelation, Sullivan erases his records from the police computer system. Costigan forwards Madolyn recordings, which Costello willed to him of confidential conversations incriminating Sullivan as a mole, prompting her to abandon Sullivan.

Costigan arranges to meet Sullivan at the building where Queenan died, where he holds him at gunpoint. Trooper Brown, a friend of Costigan's from the academy, also arrives at his behest, but he has not brought Dignam as requested and instead treats him with suspicion. Trooper Barrigan from Special Investigations arrives and kills both Costigan and Brown, revealing that he was a second mole for Costello. Sullivan then kills Barrigan and frames him as the only mole.

At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan notices that Madolyn is tearful. She ignores him when he attempts to speak to her. Later, Sullivan arrives home to his apartment and is confronted by Dignam, who kills him. As he leaves, a rat traces across the balcony.

Production 
In January 2003, Warner Bros., producer Brad Grey, and actor/producer Brad Pitt bought the rights to remake the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs (2002) from Media Asia for $1.75 million. William Monahan was secured as screenwriter, and later Martin Scorsese, who admired Monahan's script, came on board as director.

In March 2004, United Press International announced that Scorsese would be remaking Infernal Affairs and setting it in Boston, and Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt were slated to star. Pitt, tentatively scheduled to play Sullivan, later declined to play the role, saying a younger actor should play the part; he decided to produce the film instead. Scorsese's associate Kenneth Lonergan suggested Matt Damon, who grew up in Boston, for the part of Sullivan, and Scorsese asked Jack Nicholson to play Costello.

Nicholson wanted the film to have ""something a little more"" than the usual gangster film, and screenwriter Monahan came up with the idea of basing the Costello character on Irish-American gangster Whitey Bulger. This gave the screenplay an element of realism – and an element of dangerous uncertainty, because of the wide-ranging carte blanche the FBI gave Bulger in exchange for revealing information about fellow gangsters. A technical consultant on the film was Tom Duffy, who had served three decades on the Boston Police Department, particularly as an undercover detective investigating the Irish mob.

The Departed was officially greenlit by Warners in early 2005 and began shooting in the spring of 2005. Although some of the film was shot on location in Boston, for budgetary and logistical reasons many scenes, interiors in particular, were shot in locations and sets in New York City, which had tax incentives for filmmakers that Boston at the time did not.

Themes and motifs 
Film critic Stanley Kauffmann said that for The Departed, Scorsese ""was apparently concerned with the idea of identity, one of the ancient themes of drama, and how it affects one’s actions, emotions, self-knowledge, even dreams."" Kaufmann however did not find the theme conveyed with particular effectiveness in the film.

The father-son relationship is a motif throughout the film. Costello acts as a father figure to both Sullivan and Costigan, while Queenan acts as Costello's foil in the role of father figure. Sullivan addresses Costello as ""Dad"" whenever he calls to inform him of police activities.

In the final scene, a rat is seen on Sullivan's window ledge. Scorsese acknowledges that while it is not meant to be taken literally, it somewhat symbolizes the ""quest for the rat"" in the film and the strong sense of distrust among the characters, much like post-9/11 U.S. The window view behind the rat is a nod to gangster films like Little Caesar (1931), Scarface (1932), and White Heat (1949).

Throughout the film, Scorsese uses an ""X"" motif to foreshadow death in a manner similar to Howard Hawks' classic film Scarface (1932). Examples include (but are not limited to) shots of cross-beam supports in an airport walkway when Costigan is phoning Sgt. Dignam, the taped windows of the building Queenan enters before being thrown to his death, behind Costigan's head in the elevator before he is shot, and the carpeted hallway floor when Sullivan returns to his apartment before being shot by Dignam at the film's end .

Reception

Box office 
The Departed grossed $132.4 million in the United States and Canada and $159 million in other territories for a total gross of $291.5 million, against a production budget of $90 million.

The film grossed $26.9 million in its opening weekend, becoming the third Scorsese film to debut at number one. In the following three weeks the film grossed $19 million, $13.5 million and $9.8 million, finishing second at the box office each time, before grossing $7.7 million and dropping to 5th in its fifth week.

Critical response 
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 91% approval rating based on 277 reviews, with an average rating of 8.24/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""Featuring outstanding work from an excellent cast, The Departed is a thoroughly engrossing gangster drama with the gritty authenticity and soupy morality we come to expect from Martin Scorsese."" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 85 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of ""A–"" on an A+ to F scale.

Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade ""best of"" list, saying: ""If they're lucky, directors make one classic film in their career. Martin Scorsese has one per decade (Taxi Driver in the '70s, Raging Bull in the '80s, Goodfellas in the '90s). His 2006 Irish Mafia masterpiece kept the streak alive.""

Online critic James Berardinelli awarded the film four stars out of four, praising it as ""an American epic tragedy."" He went on to claim that the film deserves to be ranked alongside Scorsese's past successes, including Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas.

Andrew Lau, the co-director of Infernal Affairs, who was interviewed by Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily, said: ""Of course I think the version I made is better, but the Hollywood version is pretty good too. [Scorsese] made the Hollywood version more attuned to American culture."" Andy Lau, one of the main actors in Infernal Affairs, when asked how the movie compares to the original, said: ""The Departed was too long and it felt as if Hollywood had combined all three Infernal Affairs movies together."" Although Lau said the script of the remake had some ""golden quotes"", he also felt it had a bit too much profanity. He ultimately rated The Departed 8/10 and said that the Hollywood remake is worth a view, though according to Lau's spokeswoman Alice Tam, he felt that the combination of the two female characters into one in The Departed was not as good as the original storyline.

A few critics were disappointed in the film, including J. Hoberman of the Village Voice, who wrote: ""Infernal Affairs was surprisingly cool and effectively restrained for HK action, but Scorsese raises the temperature with every ultraviolent interaction. The surplus of belligerence and slur reach near-Tarantinian levels—appropriate as he’s staking a claim to QT’s turf.""

Top ten lists 
The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2006. Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer, Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal, Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle, and Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it one of the top ten films of 2006. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times named it the best film of the 2000s.

Accolades 

At the 64th Golden Globe Awards on January 15, 2007, The Departed won one award for Best Director (Martin Scorsese), while being nominated for five other awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Leonardo DiCaprio), Best Supporting Actor (Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg), and Best Screenplay (William Monahan).

At the 79th Academy Awards on February 25, 2007, The Departed won four Academy Awards: Best Picture (Graham King), Best Director (Martin Scorsese), Best Film Editing (Thelma Schoonmaker), and Best Adapted Screenplay (William Monahan). Mark Wahlberg was also nominated for the Best Supporting Actor award for his performance, but he lost to Alan Arkin for his role in Little Miss Sunshine.

The film marked the first time Scorsese won an Oscar after six previous losses. Many felt that he deserved it years earlier for prior efforts. Some have even gone further, calling it a Lifetime Achievement Award for a lesser film. Scorsese himself joked that he won because: ""This is the first movie I've done with a plot."" While accepting the award, Scorsese stated that ""I just want to say, too, that so many people over the years have been wishing this for me, strangers, you know. I go walking in the street people say something to me, I go in a doctor's office, I go in a...whatever...elevators, people are saying, ""You should win one, you should win one."" I go for an x-ray, ""You should win one."" And I'm saying, ""Thank you."" And then friends of mine over the years and friends who are here tonight are wishing this for me and my family. I thank you. This is for you.""

At the 11th Satellite Awards on December 18, 2006, The Departed won awards for Best Ensemble, Motion Picture, Best Motion Picture, Drama, Best Screenplay – Adapted (William Monahan), and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Leonardo DiCaprio).

In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list.

Home media 
The Departed was released by Warner Brothers on DVD in 2007. The film is available in a single-disc full screen (1.33:1), single-disc widescreen (2.40:1) edition, and 2-disc special edition. The second disc contains deleted scenes; a feature about the influence of New York’s Little Italy on Scorsese; a Turner Classic Movies profile; and a 21-minute documentary titled Stranger Than Fiction: The True Story of Whitey Bulger, Southie and The Departed about the crimes that influenced Scorsese in creating the film, including the story of James ""Whitey"" Bulger, upon whom Jack Nicholson's character is based.

The Region 1 version has three available audio tracks: English, Spanish, and French (all of which are in Dolby Digital 5.1), and three subtitle tracks (English, Spanish, French). The film was released on HD DVD and Blu-ray at the same time as the standard-definition DVD. The 2-Disc Special Edition was packaged in a Limited Edition Steelbook. It marked the first time that an Oscar-winning Best Picture was released to the home video market in DVD format only, as VHS was phased out by the start of 2006.

Music 
There were two albums released for The Departed, one presenting the original score composed for the film by Howard Shore, and the other featuring earlier recordings, mostly pop/rock songs, which were used on the soundtrack.

Soundtrack 

As with previous Scorsese films, Robbie Robertson had a hand in picking the music. The film opens with ""Gimme Shelter"" by The Rolling Stones (""Let It Loose"" also appears later on), and prominently plays ""I'm Shipping Up to Boston"" by Dropkick Murphys with lyrics written by Woody Guthrie, which gained the band some popularity and their first and only platinum selling single. The film features the live version of Pink Floyd's ""Comfortably Numb"" from the 1990 Berlin Wall concert performed by Roger Waters, Van Morrison, and Rick Danko, Levon Helm, and Garth Hudson of The Band.

Although ""Gimme Shelter"" is featured twice in the film, the song does not appear on the album soundtrack. Also heard in the movie but not featured on the soundtrack is ""Thief's Theme"" by Nas, ""Well Well Well"" by John Lennon, ""Bang Bang"" by Joe Cuba, and the Act II Sextet from Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.

The film closes with a cover of Don Gibson's ""Sweet Dreams"", by Roy Buchanan.

Score 
The film score for The Departed was written by Howard Shore and performed by guitarists Sharon Isbin, G. E. Smith, Larry Saltzman and Marc Ribot. The score was recorded in Shore's own studio in New York State. The album, The Departed: Original Score, was released December 5, 2006 by New Line, and produced by Jason Cienkus.

Scorsese described the music as ""a very dangerous and lethal tango"" and cited the guitar-based score of Murder by Contract and the zither in The Third Man as inspiration.

Cancelled sequel 
Although many of the key characters in the film are deceased by the movie's end, there was a script written for a sequel. This was ultimately shelved due to the expense and Scorsese's lack of interest in creating a sequel.

"Atunda Ayenda

Atunda Ayenda is a radio soap opera broadcast on 27 stations within Sierra Leone and through the Internet.  It was created by Talking Drum Studios and was the first radio soap opera aired in Sierra Leone.  In the Mandingo language Atunda Ayenda means Lost and Found.  The plot on the show revolved around young people and their experiences of the Sierra Leone Civil War, with story-arcs addressing contemporary issues such as HIV/AIDS.

Background
In 2000, Sierra Leone's 10-year Civil War came to an end leaving the country to rebuild itself and enact a disarmament programme.  Search for Common Ground, an international non-profit organization, started Talking Drum Studios to produce media content to address problems experienced after the war and promote peace and reconciliation. In December 2001, it produced Atunda Ayenda, which means lost and found in the Mandingo language, the first radio soap opera aired in Sierra Leone.  The show quickly gained significant popularity; according to a 2004 survey of Sierra Leonean radio listeners, 90 percent of respondents said that they regularly listened to the show and 80 percent discussed the content with family and friends.

Narrative
The narrative is divided into stages with story arcs reflecting current events in Sierra Leone. Each stage is written independently in the period just prior to broadcasting so that the stories are always up-to-date. The show's narrative is a reflection of the real experiences of people throughout Sierra Leone with the writers travelling to remote areas of the country to research the stories. The plot of the show revolves around young people and their experiences of the Sierra Leone Civil War and reconstruction after the war. Individual story-arcs address contemporary issues such as HIV/AIDS. The show was originally scripted by Kemoh Daramy but is now written by a team of writers.

Characters
 Dragon - an ex-combatant who did not take part in the disarmament process.
 Matuka - who was held prisoner by Dragon but escaped to Nigeria.
 Tapia - a hot tempered character who coaches football and is in love with Matuka.

Production

The show is normally produced in the Krio language, but Talking Drum Studios has joined partners with the BBC World Service to produce an English version of the show.  The original producers of the show were Desmond During and Emrys Savage with assistants including Isastu Mansaray. Some members of the cast, for example Isata Mahoi who plays Mamy Saio, also work as programme editors.

Format
The show is broadcast weekly, from Monday to Friday, on 21 radio stations within Sierra Leone and on the Internet in an MP3 format. Old episodes of the show following from programme 850 are also available on the Internet. The show is 15 minutes in length when its theme tune is included and is usually broadcast on an evening prime-time slot at 17:45, GMT.  A 30-minute summary of the show is also broadcast during the weekend.

"Alien Brigade

Alien Brigade is a horizontally-scrolling rail shooter released by Atari Corporation in 1990 for the Atari 7800. Similar in style to Operation Wolf, Alien Brigade tells the story of a soldier battling with alien invaders that take over the bodies of fallen soldiers. 

Despite being released late in the Atari 7800's life cycle, Atari Corporation made more efforts to market the game than it had with other Atari 7800 titles. The game had its own print advertisement and was referenced in Atari's 1990 shooter, Planet Smashers (Alien Brigade would return the favor by advertising Planet Smashers).

Alien Brigade is 144K in size, making it one of the largest commercially released Atari 7800 games.

Gameplay 
The game is played from a first-person point of view and scrolls horizontally in two directions as various enemy creatures, possessed soldiers, human vehicles and alien vehicles attack the player character. Alien Brigade can either be played with the Atari 7800 joystick or with an Atari light gun.

The game has five levels and four difficulty modes. The initial mission is to rescue hostages from an enemy camp, but the game then progresses to a waterfront battle, an underwater melee, a showdown in an underground mine, and then a final mountaintop battle. Adding to the challenge, the player must be careful not to shoot innocent bystanders.

Between levels, the player is briefed by the commanding officer, who advises of the situation and rates the player's performance in the level.

Reception 
Alien Brigade was reviewed in the September 1991 issue of Atari's own Atari Explorer magazine.

"Mordecai Wyatt Johnson

Mordecai Wyatt Johnson (January 4, 1891 – September 10, 1976) was an American educator and pastor. He served as the first black president of Howard University, from 1926 until 1960. Johnson has been considered one of the three leading African-American preachers of the early 20th-century, along with Vernon Johns and Howard Thurman.

Early life

Johnson was born on January 12, 1890, in Paris, Tennessee. His parents were former slaves. His father was Reverend Wyatt J. Johnson, a preacher and mill worker, and his mother, Carolyn Freeman, was a domestic worker for one of the prominent families in town.

Education

Johnson attended a small elementary school in his native town. Afterwards, he moved to Nashville, where he studied at Roger Williams University. Later he studied at Howe Institute in Memphis.

He eventually transferred to the Atlanta Baptist College (now Morehouse College) where he completed his secondary and undergraduate education. During his college career, he was a member of the debating team and the Glee Club, a star athlete in three sports, and quarterback of the football team. Offered a faculty position at the college upon graduation, he taught English and economics and served a year as acting dean. He maintained a profound interest in economics throughout his career—an interest that was apparent in some of his major addresses.

After one year of teaching, he continued his education at the University of Chicago, where he received a second A.B. degree, and at the Rochester Theological Seminary in Rochester, New York, where he earned the B.D. degree. At Rochester he was profoundly influenced by the great ""social gospel"" advocate, Walter Rauchenbusch. His experiences there made an indelible impact upon his thinking and his entire career.

Family

Johnson married Anna Ethelyn Gardner on December 25, 1916. They had five children: Carolyn Elizabeth Johnson, Mordecai Wyatt Johnson, Jr., Archer Clement Johnson, William Howard Johnson, and Anna Faith Johnson.

Career

Following a brief stint as secretary of the western region of the Student YMCA, in 1917 he became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charleston, West Virginia.  He later founded a chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

Presidency of Howard University 

On June 26, 1926, at the age of 36, Johnson was unanimously elected the eleventh President of Howard University, becoming the first African American to serve as the permanent head of that institution. Prior to his appointment Johnson had served as Professor of Economics and History at Morehouse College. He had also served as Pastor of the First Baptist Church in Charleston, West Virginia.

During his tenure, Johnson appointed Charles Hamilton Houston as dean of the law school, who played a significant role in dismantling the Jim Crow laws.

Johnson raised millions of dollars for new buildings and for upgrading all of the schools. National honor societies, including Phi Beta Kappa, were established on the campus of Howard.

During his administration, it was said that Howard had the greatest collection of African American scholars to be found anywhere. Notable scholars at Howard included:

 Alain Locke, graduated from English and Philosophy at Harvard, and was the first African American Rhodes Scholar,
 Ralph Bunche, professor of political science and later a Nobel Laureate;
 Charles Drew, who perfected the use of blood plasma; 
 Percy Julian, a noted chemist; 
 and Sterling Brown, professor of English and noted Harlem Renaissance poet.

Johnson brought Howard university into national prominence and served as president of Howard for 34 years, since 1926 until his retirement in 1960. In this time the enrollment at Howard University increased from 2,000 in 1926 to more than 10,000 in 1960.

Johnson the Orator

Johnson was an annual speaker for the Education Night at the National Baptist Convention, a speaker at the Ford Hall Forum in Boston, and spoke alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others at the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. He traveled 25,000 miles a year throughout the country speaking principally on topics such as racism, segregation, and discrimination.  In 1951 he was a member of the American delegation to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that met in London.

Awards and recognitions

In 1929, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) awarded Johnson the Spingarn Medal (its highest honor at that time), for Johnson's ability to secure annual federal funds to support the university's financial future.

Death

Johnson died on September 10, 1976, at the age of 86, in Washington, D.C.

"Ibbi-Sin

Ibbi-Sin (, ), son of Shu-Sin, was king of Sumer and Akkad and last king of the Ur III dynasty, and reigned c. 1963–1940 BCE (Short chronology). During his reign, the Sumerian empire was attacked repeatedly by Amorites. As faith in Ibbi-Sin's leadership failed, Elam declared its independence and began to raid as well.

Ibbi-Sin ordered fortifications built at the important cities of  Ur and Nippur, but these efforts were not enough to stop the raids or keep the empire unified. Cities throughout Ibbi-Sin's empire fell away from a king who could not protect them, notably Isin under the Amorite ruler Ishbi-Erra. Ibbi-Sin was, by the end of his kingship, left with only the city of Ur. In 1940 BCE, the Elamites, along with ""tribesmen from the region of Shimashki in the Zagros Mountains"" sacked Ur and took Ibbi-Sin captive; he was taken to the city of Elam where he was imprisoned and, at an unknown date, died.

The success of the Amorite invasion
The Amorites were considered a backward people by Mesopotamian standards; Ibbi-Sin's 17th year was officially named ""Year the Amorites, the powerful south wind who, from the remote past, have not known cities, submitted to Ibbi-Sin the king of Ur."" However, despite his father Shu-Sin having built a ""wall of Martu"" across Mesopotamia against Amorite incursions, these were penetrated early in Ibbi-Sin's reign.

Scholars have suggested that, by the reign of Ibbi-Sin, the empire was already in decline due to long-term drought – in fact, the same drought that helped to take down the Akkadian Empire c. 2193 BCE may have been responsible for the fall of Ur III.

Studies of Persian Gulf sediments indicate that the stream flow of the Tigris and Euphrates was very low around 2100–2000 BCE. [...] Any damage to the agricultural system by enemy raids, bureaucratic mismanagement, or an inattentive ruler would result in food shortages

In years seven and eight of Ibbi-Sin's kingship, the price of grain increased to 60 times the norm, which means that the success of the Amorites in disrupting the Ur III empire is, at least in part, a product of attacks on the agricultural and irrigation systems; these attacks brought famine and caused an economic collapse in the empire, paving the way for the Elamites under Kindattu to strike into Ur and capture the king.

"Trumai language

Trumai is an endangered language isolate of Brazil. Most Trumai are fluent in languages of wider communication, and children are not learning it well.

Background 
Trumai is a language spoken by the indigenous community of the same name located in the Xingu reserve along the Upper Xingu River in central Brazil.  Murphy and Quain reported that there were only 25 people remaining in the Trumai community.  Fortunately, this has since increased to 94 as of 1997, of which 51 people spoke the Trumai language.  In the International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, Grimes observes that there are 78 speakers as of 2003.  Due to the popularity of speaking Portuguese among the local population, Trumai is considered an extremely endangered language because the children are not learning to speak it as a first language.

The Trumai people first entered the Upper Xingu region sometime in the early 19th century after being driven away from southeastern Brazil by the Xavante people.  The first contact the Trumai had with a white person was in 1884 when Karl von den Steinen explored the Upper Xingu region.  He observed the differences between Trumai culture and other Xingu cultures due to the Trumai’s relocation. In the fifty years or so that followed Von den Steinem’s first visit to the Trumai, there is little documentation of the community because researchers who visited the Xingu region preferred visiting and studying other indigenous cultures instead.

In the time between the Trumai’s first arrival in the upper Xingu and Von den Steinen’s first contact with them, they were continuously being attacked by the native communities in the region, including the Suyá and Ikpeng. Following a period of contacts from researchers, including Buell Quain in 1938, the Trumai moved to a new territory again, this time because of a flu and measles epidemic.  After recovering from this, the subsequent population increase led to the emergence of more Trumai villages in the Upper Xingu region, while their former territories have since become occupied by other communities.

Despite being surrounded by a variety of different languages that belong to the four major stocks of Brazilian indigenous languages (Tupi, Arawak, Cariban, and Ge), Trumai is an isolated language.  There is speculation that Trumai belongs to the Equatorial language stock, in which case it is still very far removed from other languages and families belonging here.

Initial research done on the Trumai was included in an overall study of the cultures of the Xingu region, which was performed through surveys focussing on “material culture”.  Quain was the first researcher to focus on the Trumai culture specifically, however, this was an anthropological study, not linguistic.  In the preface to her thesis “A Reference Grammar of Trumaí”, Guirardello states that Monod-Becquelin was the first person to conduct descriptive studies on the Trumai language, in which she focused on aspects of the language such as ergativity and phonological transcriptions.  Monod-Becquelin’s early work was followed by Greenberg’s research, which includes his aforementioned proposal that Trumai, instead of being a completely isolated language, belongs to the Equatorial stock.

Guirardello’s “A Reference Grammar of Trumai” is the first proper description of Trumai grammar, which Guirardello composed with the intention of it becoming an aid for future research papers on the language.  Since then, research on the Trumai language has increased, leading to studies of various aspects of the language.  Monod-Becquelin has continued her research by investigating the use of transitive verbs in Trumai. Guirardello’s work has also included studies into Trumai’s ergativity, focussing on the ergative-absolutive patterns in its morphology and the complexity of its syntax due to the nominative-accusative patterns also present.

Trumai was one of the 24 indigenous languages studied in South America as part of a series of documentation projects conducted by DoBeS (Documenting Endangered Languages).  DoBeS is one of the many language documentation organizations operating in Brazil, and is funded by the Volkswagen Foundation.

The Trumai culture has also been the topic of anthropological studies.  The first was done by Buell Quain, who spent four months with the Trumai and gathered information on many aspects of the culture and community.  More recently, De Vienne has conducted ethnographic studies on Trumai focussing on language and communication in the community, such as joking and ritual singing traditions.

Grammar

Phonology 

This inventory is atypical of Amazonian languages (Trumai is a recent immigrant to the Xingu basin) in its ejective consonants, the lateral fricative , and the alveolar–dental distinction. Guirardello, who specializes on Trumai, has presented varied inventories of these phonemes: Guirardello (1999a) lists /t̪ t̪' ts ts' s/ as dental, and /t t' d n l ɬ ɾ/ as alveolar; whereas Guirardello (1999b) lists only /t/ and /t'/ as alveolar. Younger speakers do not make the ejective distinction.

The vocalic inventory is /, , , , / and . Syllable structure is maximally CVC, and stress always falls on the final syllable of a word.

Morphology 
The morphological aspects of Trumai as covered in Guirardello’s grammar of the language include the parts of speech: nouns, verbs, and auxiliaries.  Under nouns, she investigates the effect of adjectives, plurality in the language, and count versus mass nouns, among others. Under verbs, she focuses on causality, negation, intensity, and imperativity in verb particles. And under auxiliaries, she discusses body posture, mood and aspect, and directional auxiliaries.  Chapter 5 explores further analyses of each of these aspects of the parts of speech in terms of “Simple Declarative Clauses”.

Pronouns in Trumai are distinguished by person, gender, number, and listener inclusion/exclusion in the first-person plural pronoun.  Like in English, gender is only seen in the third-person singular pronoun, while number is categorized as singular, dual, and plural (whereas English only has singular and plural).  They are also affected by the type of Noun Phrase (henceforth “NP”) they appear in (absolutive, ergative, or dative), which are distinguished by suffix insertion.  The following are tables of the Trumai personal pronouns with examples included for the absolutive case:

Absolutive:

ha hu’tsa chï(_in)       [huksitukuk yi]-ki       [yayanke tam]

1   see     Foc/Tens     capivara      YI-Dat    deer        Com

“I saw a capivara and a deer.”

Ergative:

[Karu], [Kumaru], [Atawaka] hai-ts  amidoxos ke.

Karu     Kumaru    Atawaka   1-Erg  call          KE

‘I called Karu, Kumaru, and Atawaka.’

Dative:

kiki-k         atlat-ø       kï̡tï    ha wan-ki.

man-Erg    pan-Abs   give   1-Dat

‘The man gave it to us.’

1st-person/exclusive pronouns are formed in ha, inclusive with ka, 2nd person with hi, and 3rd with in. Dual number is indicated by the suffix -a, and plural by -wan. Masculine and feminine are distinguished in the 3rd person.  Alienable possession is indicated by the suffix -kte or -kate on the possessor (Kumaru-kte tahu ""Kumaru's spoon""), and inalienable possession by juxtaposition (dinoxo kuʃ ""the girl's head"", ha kuʃ ""my head"").  Suffixes are used to mark ergative (-ts for 1sg, otherwise -ek/-ak), dative, locative, allative, comitative, and instrumental case.

One interesting phenomena in Trumai morphology is the use of particles in the language. Guirardello first discusses them as a form of identifying tense in lieu of the tense-aspect-mood affixes used in English.  These word formations are ‘ka in’, used for present or the recent past, and ‘chï in’, for past tense, but they are only used when the tense is not indicated via context.  In a sentence, these particles appear as so:

ka_in:

[[Yaka] chumuchu] ka_in         tehnene-n.

Yaka     lie.down    Foc/Tens   floor-Loc

‘Yaka lay.down on the floor.’

chï_in:

[ha ayen]-atl              chï_in        [hai]-ts [oke          yi] kï̡tï.

1   grandfather-Dat   Foc/Tens   1-Erg    medicine YI give

‘I gave medicine to my grandfather (emphasis).’

As a whole, particles in Trumai are defined as a verb modifier that is not an adverb or auxiliary instead of being placed in a class of its own.  There are four classes of particles in Trumai: Intensity, Negation, Causative, and Intensity.  These modifiers fall under the ‘particle’ label because of their characteristics which differentiate them from auxiliaries. For example, while auxiliaries can only modify verbs, Intensity and Negation particles can also modify adverbs and quantifiers.

The use of auxiliaries in Trumai is also very fascinating.  In the language, they are defined as verb modifiers “associated with the domain of aspect, mood, and spatial orientation (this last domain is subdivided into body posture of the entity performing the event and directionality of the event being performed)”.  Here are some examples of each of these auxiliaries used in sentences:

Aspect/Mood:

iyi    sone-kma-n          de.

IYI   drink-Perf-3Abs   already

‘He already finished drinking.’ OR ‘He already drank all.’

Body Posture:

iyi  ma   chumuchu-n.

IYI  eat   lie-3Abs

‘He is eating lying (on the floor).’

Directionals:

ha ka’chï lako.

1   walk   Dir(down hill)

‘I go down walking.'

Guirardello makes a point of noting the significant differences between auxiliaries and verbs in Trumai: there is no independent argument structure, no lexical content, some experience phonological reduction, and they form a closed class.  Their syntactic position is restricted to following a verb in the VP, which distinguishes them from adverbs, which hold a more flexible position in sentences.  Apart from appearing inside the VP following the Verb, a property of some auxiliaries is that “they can bear the 3Abs enclitic –n/-e”.

Syntax

Ergative-Absolutive Language Structure 
Trumai is a language with ergative-absolutive case assignment and therefore has three argument types: absolutive, ergative, and dative.  The ergative-absolutive language system is described as that “in which a subject in an intransitive construction is realized in the same way as a patient or object in a transitive construction, and is thus distinguished from the subject or agent in the transitive”.  It is “manifested through case-marking, verb-marking, and word order”.

Dative case is used for verbs such as 'eat', 'see', and 'talk with'. There are two verbs 'kill', one, -fa, which takes a dative, and one, disi, which takes the ergative. Constituent order is basically ergative-absolutive-verb-dative (SV, SVB, AOV, AOVB). Ergative and dative arguments, which are marked by postpositions, may occur on the other side of the verb, but for an absolutive to do this, it needs to be marked with ke.

In noun phrases (including pronouns), the grammatical case is marked by an enclitic.  For example, an ergative NP would end in either –ek or –k. Case marking using enclitics also occurs for Dative, Locative, and Genitive cases.  In the case of personal pronouns, the first person singular pronoun also allows the enclitic –ts.  The first person singular pronoun is also changed from ha in Absolutive case to hai for Ergative and Dative cases.

An interesting phenomenon in Trumai syntax is the NP morpheme iyi/yi because of its lack of a clear function. It always appears phrase-final, as iyi when only the noun itself is included in the phrase, but as yi when pluralizers or other lexical items are also included. However, despite this rule, there are still occasions where iyi appears in an NP with a lexical item.  When it is present in Ergative and Dative sentences, the enclitics for each case are still added to the end of the NP:

Reduced form:

[inatl         yi]   pech ka_in.

3Pr(Fem)        run   Foc/Tens

‘She is running.’

No lexical item:

[iyi] pech-e       ka_in.

run-3Abs   Foc/Tens

‘She/he is running.’

Ergative/Dative:

that.one PL    -Erg   Foc/Tens   1 beat

‘They (these ones) beat me.’

For verb phrases in Trumai, case marking provides four verb categories: Intransitive, Transitive, Extended Intransitive, and Extended Transitive, where Intransitive verbs can have Absolutive case, Transtive verbs have Absolutive and Ergative case, and the Extended categories also have Dative case on top of this.  Guirardello labels arguments as S, A, O, and DAT for case-marking instead of terms such as “agent” and “patient”.

Guirardello observed three types of clauses in Trumai sentences. Intransitive clauses attach the case marking /-ø/ to the S noun phrase or attach the third person enclitic –n/-e to the end of the verb phrase.  Transitive clauses have A marked by –(V)k and O marked by –ø. Similarly to Intransitive clauses, the third person enclitic is added to the VP when A is absent.  In Ditransitive clauses, the same marking occurs for A and O that we see in Transitive clauses.  The DAT argument is marked by either –(V)tl, -ki, or –(V)s “depending on the characteristics of the head of the NP”.  No marking is attached to the VP when DAT is absent from the sentence. These clauses are proof of the Ergative-Absolutive argument of Trumai, as we see S and O undergo the same marking, while A is treated differently.  In sentences, they would appear as follows:

Intransitive:

S             V

pet’ew-ø achïkida

frog-Abs jump

‘The frog jumps.’ (256)

Transitive:

A           V

ine-k   Ø mapa-n

3-Erg      break-3Abs

‘He broke it (a valuable pan).'

Ditransitive:

A        O           V      DAT

kiki-k  atlat-ø     kï̡tï  kasoro-s

1-Erg  rice-Abs give dog-Dat

‘I gave rice to the dogs.'

The Absolutive argument is obligatory and therefore occurs in all clause types.  Its case-marking is –ø or it has none at all and its syntactic placement is within the VP, before the verb (Guirardello is not clear as to whether it appears immediately before the verb or if other lexical items can be placed between them).

The Ergative argument is marked by –(V)k and only occurs in Transitive clauses, where it is the main argument of the verb and is therefore always required.  Its syntactic placement is preceding the VP.  While there are certain scenarios where it can be absent from a sentence that mainly occurs when there is discourse continuity.  If it occurs without this, then the sentence has passive or middle voice.

The Dative argument is marked by –(V)tl, -ki, or –(V)s.  Like the Ergative argument, it occurs before and outside of the VP.  It is only obligatory in Extended clauses, where it is the main argument of the verb.

Trumai’s causative construction uses the particle ka, which appears after the verb and can modify it.  For Intransitive and Extended Transitive verbs, the causee is marked as Absolutive, while the causer is marked as Ergative. While this makes it similar to a simple Transitive clause, the difference is that the Absolutive enclitic is marked on the particle instead of the verb.  For Transitive verbs, both the causee and causer are marked Ergative:

a.

hai-ts Yakairu-ø      sa        ka.

1-Erg Yakairu-Abs dance  Caus

‘I made Yakairu dance.’ [Intransitive verb]

b.

hai-ts sa        ka-n.

1-Erg dance  Caus-3Abs.

‘I made her dance.'

Semantics

Quantifiers 
In Trumai, quantifiers appear before the noun they modify.  For numerals, while the language includes the names for 1-10, most often only numbers 1-5 are spoken:

‘1’ mihin         ‘2’ huch           ‘3’ huch tahme

‘4’ pine       pine-kte       len               ‘5’ ine         k’ad  kel-an

     Friend   friend-Gen   group               3Masc  hand finger-Loc

Other quantifier words (ex. ‘few’, ‘many’, etc.) change depending on whether they appear before count or mass nouns.  They also vary from speaker to speaker, as in the case of “few” versus “a little”, some speakers can distinguish the two based on how they appear before count vs. non-count words, while others cannot except for “high quantities”.  When they are distinguished, the quantifiers used by some speakers are:

While most speakers, who cannot distinguish between count and mass nouns for small quantities, say:

Aside from the above forms, there is an alternate form to describe small quantities: pa̡t “few”, which is meant to describe a small portion of an object.  Here are some examples for each type of the above quantifiers:

Many/a lot:     a’di    ka_in        k’ate yi.

(count)           many Foc/Tens  fish   YI

‘There are many fish.’ (or: ‘The fish are many/big in quantity.’)

Many/a lot:     pïx    ka_in        misu  yi.

(mass)            a.lot  Foc/Tens water YI

‘There is a lot of water.’ (or: ‘The water is big in quantity.’)

Few/a little:                a’di     tak   ka_in        k’ate yi.

(some speakers)       many  Neg Foc/Tens  fish   YI

‘There are a few fish.’ (or: ‘The fish are not many.’)

Few/a little:                pïx     tak  ka_in        k’ate yi.

(most speakers)         a.lot  Neg Foc/Tens  fish   YI

‘There are a few fish.’ (or: ‘The fish are not many.’)

Few:  atlat        pa̡t.

          clay.pan  small

‘small clay.pan.’

Just as is seen above where “few/a little” are formed as “many/a lot” plus a negation, there is no word for “none”, so negation is added in its place as well:

katnon take    tak   [kiki wan yi].

work    Desid Neg  man PL   YI

‘No man wants to work.’ (lit: ‘The men do not want to work.’)

Quantifiers (numeral and otherwise) can also appear as a clause predicate or a focussed unit, in which they appear at the beginning of a sentence and are followed by a Focus/Tense particle.

Person plays a crucial role in what NP a quantifier is assigned to. Guirardello explains that in a sentence where there is both first- and third-person nouns/pronouns, it is clear that the quantifier is attached to the third-person.  This is not as clear when there are two third-person NPs in a sentence.  In order to understand which NP the quantifier is modifying in this scenario, one must look at what kinds of NPs are in the clause with the quantifier and if it is also being modified by a pluralizer.

"Ricardo (footballer, born 1980)

Ricardo Jorge Ferreira Pinto da Silva (born 19 August 1980), known simply as Ricardo, is a Cape Verdean professional footballer who plays for Portuguese club C.D. Feirense as a central defender or right back.

Club career
Ricardo was born in Azurém, Guimarães, Portugal, and he started playing football with amateurs Centro de Cultura e Desporto Desportivo de Ronfe and G.D. Serzedelo. In the following three years he played in the third division, representing F.C. Famalicão (one season) and S.C. Freamunde (two).

In the summer of 2004, Ricardo moved straight to the Primeira Liga, signing with S.C. Beira-Mar. He featured in 29 games in his first season (24 starts), but suffered relegation; he continued to appear regularly for the Aveiro team during his spell, overall playing two seasons apiece in each of Portugal's major levels.

Ricardo returned to the top flight for 2008–09, joining F.C. Paços de Ferreira. In the following campaign's opener he scored with his head to earn his side a point against FC Porto in a 1–1 home draw, and was an everpresent defensive figure in his two-year stint.

In June 2010, Ricardo signed with Vitória de Guimarães also in the top tier – he had been brought up as a youth at the Minho club. In January 2012, after a brief spell in China, he returned to Portugal and Paços on a three-and-a-half-year contract.

International career
Although born in Portugal, Ricardo opted to represent Cape Verde through ancestry. He received his first call-up in May 2008, first appearing on 27 May in a friendly with Luxembourg.

In June 2010, Ricardo started in the 0–0 draw that the minnows (ranked 117th) managed against Portugal, as the Europeans were preparing for that year's FIFA World Cup.

"Frank Hall (trade unionist)

Frank Hall (1860 – 2 December 1927) was an English trade unionist.

Hall began working at a coal mine at the age of ten, becoming a checkweighman sixteen years later.  He became active in the Derbyshire Miners' Association, and was elected as its treasurer in 1907, then when W. E. Harvey died in 1914, he was elected as the new general secretary.  He also served on the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain from 1914.

Hall was shortlisted as the Derbyshire Miners' candidate for the 1914 North East Derbyshire by-election.  He was selected by the union's executive, partly on the grounds that he was willing to run as a Labour Party candidate.  However, a vote of all the union's members overturned the executive's decision, and the union's president James Martin was instead selected to stand.  Instead, Hall was selected to contest Clay Cross at the 1918 general election, but he lost narrowly to the Coalition Liberal candidate, Thomas Tucker Broad.

Hall served as secretary of the Derbyshire Miners' until his death in 1927.

"NBL1 South

NBL1 South is a NBL1 conference based in South East Australia, comprising both a men's and women's competition. In 2019, Basketball Victoria partnered with the National Basketball League (NBL) to create NBL1 to replace the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL), Australia's pre-eminent semi-professional basketball league between 1981 and 2018. Following the merge of NBL1 and the Queensland Basketball League, the teams based in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania joined the newly created South conference of the NBL1.

History 
After a successful first season, NBL1 announced in October 2019 that it would be expanding into Queensland for the 2020 season. In January 2020, NBL1 expanded with the establishment of North and South conferences for the 2020 season. As a result, the 2019 NBL1 teams formed the new south conference. Whilst the Basketball Australia Centre of Excellence team withdrew ahead of the 2020 season, the Hobart Chargers and Mount Gambier Pioneers joined the conference and raised the number of teams to 18.

"Twin Earths

Twin Earths is an American science fiction comic strip written by Oskar Lebeck and drawn by Alden McWilliams that ran in Sunday and daily newspapers from 1952 until 1963. The strip was distributed by United Feature Syndicate.

Publication history 
The daily strip began on June 16, 1952, the Sunday on March 1, 1953. The Sunday was drawn in a half page format, but it was available in smaller formats with dropped panels.

While semi-retired, Lebeck teamed with McWilliams (who had illustrated some of Lebeck's past books and had done work for him at Dell Comics) to launch Twin Earths. It made use of the duplicate earth concept and tapped into the growing interest during the period in flying saucers. In 1957, Lebeck retired and McWilliams assumed scripting duties for the strip.

The Twin Earths Sunday strip ended December 28, 1958, while the daily strip continued until May 25, 1963.

Characters and story
The story told of another Earth (called Terra), in the same orbit as our planet but on the opposite side of the sun, whose scientifically advanced civilization visits us in flying saucers. Comics historian Stephen Donnelly noted:
The main characters of the daily strip, which began June 16, 1952, were Vana, a Terran spy living on Earth to keep tabs on our technology so the Terrans could be sure we and our war-like ways didn't pose a menace to them; and Garry Verth, an FBI agent to whom Vana revealed herself in the opening sequence. The first few months of story continuity involved a few exciting moments with Commie spies (out to get their hands on Terra's technology, of course), but mostly consisted of travelog-like views of Terran life—for example, the fact that in their liberated society, women, who constituted 92% of the population, ran things. The Sunday version began March 1 of the following year. Instead of tying in directly with the daily, or delivering a second track of story involving the same characters, this series explored a completely separate aspect of the ""twin earths"" scenario. It started with a young Texan named Punch sneaking aboard a Terran saucer just before it took off for home. After about three months, he was joined by Prince Torro, one of the relatively few Terran males, and the two boys continued as stars for the duration of the Sunday Twin Earths.

Reprints
Most of the strips have been reprinted in magazine format. In 1987, Dragon Lady Press published one issue of Science Fiction Classics featuring Twin Earths. Beginning in 1991, R. Susor Publications reprinted most of the daily and Sunday strips in three magazines, Twin Earths (eight issues), Twin Earths Sunday Pages (five issues), and Twin Earths Special Edition (one issue)

"South Sudanese nationality law

The South Sudanese nationality law dates back to 7 July 2011, when South Sudan declared independence. It is based upon the Constitution of South Sudan.

Acquisition of South Sudanese citizenship

South Sudanese citizenship can be acquired in the following ways:

 : By descent if at least one of the parents is a South Sudanese citizen.
 : By birth in South Sudan (unless citizenship of another country has been acquired by descent), or a child found in South Sudan whose parents are unknown.
 By naturalisation

South Sudanese nationality law was adopted immediately after the secession of South Sudan from Sudan and Article 8 states that:

""(1) A person born before or after this Act has entered into force shall be considered a South Sudanese National by birth if such person meets any of the following requirements—
(a) any Parents, grandparents or great-grandparents of such a person, on the male or female line, were born in South Sudan; or
(b) such person belongs to one of the indigenous ethnic communities of South Sudan.

(2) A person shall be considered a South Sudanese National by birth, if at the time of the coming into force of this Act—
(a) he or she has been domiciled in South Sudan since 1.1.1956; or
(b) if any of his or her parents or grandparents have been domiciled in South Sudan since 1.1.1956.

(3) A person born after the commencement of this Act, shall be a South Sudanese National by birth if his or her father or mother was a South Sudanese National by birth or naturalization at the time of the birth of such a person.

(4) A person who is or was first found in South Sudan as a deserted infant of unknown Parents shall, until the contrary is proved, be deemed to be a South Sudanese National by birth.""

Dual citizenship

South Sudan allows its citizens and other countries citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their South Sudanese or home citizenship. Some countries, however, do not permit multiple citizenship e.g. adults who acquired South Sudanese and Japanese citizenship by birth must declare, to the latter's Ministry of Justice, before turning 22, which citizenship they want to keep.

Travel freedom of South Sudanese citizens

Visa requirements for South Sudanese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of South Sudan. As of 1 January 2017, South Sudanese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 145 countries and territories, ranking the South Sudanese passport 96th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Ethiopian, Kosovan and Lebanese passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index.

"Haddam Island State Park

Haddam Island State Park is an undeveloped  island in the lower Connecticut River in the town of Haddam, Connecticut, in the United States. Originally used by the Wangunk tribe, the island was reserved for their use as part of a  land sale to English colonists in May 1662. In the 19th century, the island was used for fishing and farming. The early 20th century saw it as a place of public recreation, and the State of Connecticut purchased the island and made it a state park in 1944. The park is only accessible by boat, and recommended activities are boating, fishing, and birdwatching.

History
The English settlers in the Connecticut Colony originally named the island Thirty Mile Island because it was erroneously believed to be  north of the Connecticut River's mouth. The original English settlement in the area was called Thirty Mile Island Plantation. In May 1662, an area of  of land, including the island, was sold by the Wangunk tribe to the English settlers for 30 coats. However, the natives reserved the right to use the island as part of the sale stipulations. Though little documentation exists today, the Wangunk tribe lived on the island and in the surrounding area before selling it along with the rest of their land. Recorded deeds show that the Wangunk tribe made another land sale in 1672, and the remaining parcels of Wangunk land were sold between 1765 and 1769.

At the close of the 18th century, the island was one of the most important fishing locations on the Connecticut River. By 1819, the island was listed as  in area and was expected to increase in size following the construction of a pier 90 rods north of the island, which caused the accumulation of sand at the head of the island. The island is currently listed as  in size. In the 19th century, two fishing companies operated from the island and constructed piers, and the island was also used for grazing cattle and farming corn. Records in the late 19th century indicate that the Haddam Island area of the Connecticut River was dredged annually. The island became a popular recreational area with picnics and private events in the beginning of the 20th century. The island was purchased by the State of Connecticut in 1944, and it became a state park. According to legend, Captain Kidd buried some of his treasure on the island, but none has been found.

Activities
Haddam Island State Park is home to a large number of bird species, especially during annual migrations, which make it suitable for birdwatching. Bird-banding and other research activities have taken place on the island. Other recommended activities are boating and fishing. Access via boat is available from the Haddam Meadows State Park boat launch, a half mile south of Haddam Island. The northern side of the island has a beach that is fragile and cannot support heavy visitation, and the island has a significant amount of poison ivy.

"Antonio Armijo

Antonio Mariano Armijo (1804–1850) was a Spanish explorer and merchant who is famous for leading the first commercial caravan party between Abiquiú, Nuevo México and San Gabriel Mission, Alta California in 1829–1830. His route, the southernmost and most direct, is known as the Armijo Route of the Old Spanish Trail.

Abiquiú was the starting point and eastern terminus of the original route of the Old Spanish Trail. Though segments of an overland route between the Spanish colonies of Nuevo México and Alta California had been blazed decades earlier, Armijo was the first to pioneer a complete route that traveled the entire length. Armijo traveled with sixty mounted men and a caravan of pack animals carrying blankets and other trade goods to barter for mules in California. The caravan left Abiquiú on 7 November 1829 and made the journey to the San Gabriel Mission in what is now San Gabriel, California in eighty-six days, arriving on 31 January 1830. He returned by the same route in 56 days, leaving 1 March and arriving on 25 April 1830. Unlike the other routes of the Old Spanish Trail, Armijo's route was documented day by day, although in a very brief report listing dates and stopping places, with few other details and no distances recorded. The report was submitted to the governor of Nuevo México, José Antonio Cháves, and published by the Mexican government on 19 June 1830.

"Bondi Digital Publishing

Bondi Digital Publishing is a privately held New York City-based digital media company that specializes in publishing complete digital archives of major consumer magazines.

Founded by David Anthony and Murat Aktar in 2004, Bondi Digital Publishing began by developing the technology that allowed The New Yorker to publish The Complete New Yorker in September 2005, a digital archive of its entire print archive on 8 DVD-ROMs. In 2006, The New Yorker used Bondi's technology again when they released their digital archive on a portable hard drive.

In 2007, Bondi launched its publishing division when it partnered with Rolling Stone and Playboy magazines to publish both companies' entire print archives in searchable digital archives on DVD-ROM. First published in the fall of 2007, Rolling Stone Cover To Cover, the First 40 Years () and Playboy Cover to Cover, the 50s () were part of the company's Cover to Cover Series of digital archive box sets. The company marketed the series through national book and media retailers.

In a September 2007 interview, Anthony stated ""By the holiday 2008 season, we hope to have six - eight Cover To Cover titles in the line."". However, as of March, 2009, the only public release other than the aforementioned Rolling Stone and Playboy sets was a rerelease of the Rolling Stone set without the extras included in the original. A Playboy Cover to Cover, the 60s set was mentioned in the interview, but it, along with subsequent sets, is now being released exclusively through the website http://playboyarchive.com/ 

In March 2009, Bondi announced that using its technology, select digital back issues of Playboy would be available for free viewing at http://playboyarchive.com. It also announced that https://web.archive.org/web/20111006215634/http://covertocover.com/ would be changing in the Summer of 2009 to allow users to browse, search and purchase digital back issues from the entire print runs of Playboy and Rolling Stone using Bondi's online magazine application, but as of May 2011, this has not occurred. Instead, in April 2010, Rolling Stone'''s website began offering subscribers access to their digital archive. In November 2010, Bondi released a portable hard drive for Playboy, this time containing every issue from 1953 to 2010. In January 2011, it was announced that a Playboy'' iPad app would be available in March.

"Applied improvisation

Applied improvisation is the application of improvisational methods in various fields like consulting, facilitating (workshops, team trainings, meetings, conferences…), teaching, coaching, researching, generating or evolving ideas and designs, theatrical training and playing, medical and therapeutic settings or in social work.

History 

Shamans are part of every culture, starting from the origin of humanity in the Stone Age. They used stories, initiated and facilitated various rituals consisting of storytelling, dances and embodiment of past or future events and challenges. They applied basic principles of improvisation, to help people, to collaborate, to understand what is happening around them and to cope with daily life.

The Sanskrit-Theater originated 1,000 BC is a very early form of theatre. The vidusaka was part of the cast and the plot and at the same time stepped out, made comments, that mostly were improvised. He can also be seen as the first appearance of a clown.

Starting about 600 BC Rhapsodes travelled around Greece. He – only men – combined in an improvised way the epics of e. g. of Homer, myths, tales, jokes, songs and adapted this mixture spontaneously to local expectations and situations. In many aspects he built upon the traditions of the shamans and the trickster.

In the fifth century BC originated in Greece an intense examination of improvisation applied in rhetoric. Schools were established, to learn how to improvise a speech which had a t relevance as instrument of democracy and civic education.

The fourth century BC in Greece is an important milestone for the history of theatre: The roots of drama and comedy were established, also in the phylax play, a burlesque dramatic, played on wooden stages: A lot of the content was improvised. Improvisation also was applied in the Atellan Farces in ancient Rome.

Always a combination of stocked and improvised moves, dances and artistic movements coined performances of Pantomimes – in ancient Rome it was also one of the origins of improvised dancing. Their performances were influenced through traditions of the Etruscans. They also performend on public spaces, traveling around the country.

From the 12th to the 14th century Minnesang was very popular. The musicians visited castles and cities, they used stocked textes and music and added a lot of improvisation, inspired also by historical events, social developments and reactions of the audience. Both, Commedia dell’Arte and Minnesang can also be perceived as a contribution to adult education and civic education in a time, literacy was not common and access to information often difficult.

Also in the 12th emerged the Jester and had the task to use improvisational methods to call attention to urgent matters of politics and society. He was allowed to criticise decisions of the emperors. In many ways he incorporates the practise of the Trickster.

In medieval Italy Commedia dell’Arte was a revival of the Atellan Farces: Groups of actors travelled also through parts of Europe. As inspiration for the improvised parts of their plays they also used political events and current social issues, what they experienced and heard in other cities, as well as wishes and reactions of the audience.

In the 17th century the pedagogue John Comenius was one of the first who emphasized the significance of play and games as method for learning and teaching – he referred to the works of Plato. Games often consist of stepping into different personas in a blink of a moment, of pretending being in various settings and genres. They often have a certain structure and also invite to play with this structures, evolve them – therefore improvisation is an important aspect of games. Also games are often the starting points for improvisation and theatrical approaches. Also pedagogues like Pestalozzi, Fröbel and Montessori applied games and role plays in education.

The social worker Neva Boyd collected around 1920 description of various games and added own inventions. She used them to teach language skills, problem-solving, self-confidence and social skills in Chicago. She also accompanied people to cope with the effects of the Great Depression. Boyd also worked together with the theatre academic and educator Viola Spolin. She used and evolved her games which   „…were meant to promote creative expression through self discovery and personal experiences between children with extremely diverse backgrounds.” (LaPolice, 2012, S. 26). Spolin also emphasized, that these games and exercises evolved key competencies like self-efficacy, creativity, the ability for collaboration and to tackle problems. Spolin applied the games and exercises also in workshops for actors of the Compass Theater in Chicago, the first improvisational theatre group.

Also in the 1920s Jakob L. Moreno summarized existing ideas and founded in Vienna the Stegreiftheater, the Theater of Spontaneity: People attending were actors as well as the audience – the shift took often place within a used improvisational exercises or scene. Later on he used these experiences in the development of psychodrama – improvisational approaches are an important aspect in this method.

Starting in the 1950s the educator and playwright Keith Johnstone developed in the USA and Canada various improvisational games – they not only were used to train actors or to prepare for performances of improvisational theatre groups but also in workshops and projects with teachers of schools and universities, trainers in juvenile and adult education. In the development of improvisational theater also Del Close had an important function, as he developed also long form games.

Also in the 1950s started the work of Augusto Boal: He also developed various improvisational methods and applied them e. g. in the theatre of the oppressed. Actors and audience switch their roles often; Boals methods are also applied in civic education, in the training of teachers of all fields and in politics.

In 1975 Johnathan Fox and Jo Salas founded the first Playback Theatre: People from an audience tell stories of their lives, which are after that transformed in theatrical sequenzes by actors, using improvisational methods speaking, singing and dancing.

In the late 1990s the performative turn began in social research. Performance – also any kind of using improvisational approaches - was not longer considered only as a process on a theatre stage with a rather passive audience, but as a comprehensive principle for researching and understanding human actions. People like Shaun McNiff started to apply improvisational methods in arts based research projects.

2002 the Applied Improvisation Network was founded, a non-profit organization of people using improvisational methods in various fields.

Examples for the implementation of applied improvisation 

Additional in the training of actors and as preparation to improvisational theater, applied improvisation e. g. is used:

In consulting and corporate training applied improvisation is used e. g. in team and sales training, workshops for presentation skills, resilience, leadership and for people responsible for innovations.

Applied improvisation is also often used in methods like design thinking  and in service design projects  – therefore the methods are also researched and applied in UX-Design. And it is used in evolving engineering.

Another field for applied improvisation is in the education and advanced training for people working in the fields of social work, medical and health care and medicine. A new approach is to apply improvisation for disaster readiness and response. Additional to psychodrama, improvisational methods are also used in other therapeutic settings and drama therapy.

In education, improvisational approaches are used in all fields of teaching teachers, of designing and evolving didactic concepts, and also as a method of student centered learning.

As mentioned in the history, improvisational methods are also applied as research tools since the permormative turn. There are several projects connected to applied drama where improvisation is an important aspect. There are also examples of use in the fields of health and life sciences, in evolving didactics and in design research.

The Applied Improvisation Network 

The Applied Improvisation Network (AIN) is a global community of over 5000 members online and numerous local groups. Practitioners of applied improvisation facilitate workshops, for individuals or organisations, introducing them to these principles, tools etc. via solo, paired or group exercises, activities and games.

The members of the AIN are business professionals and academics who use improvisation tools, experience, and theory for human development and training in communities and organizations. The network includes consultants, managers, trainers, coaches, facilitators, performers and academics.
The AIN was founded in 2002 by Paul Z Jackson, Michael Rosenburg and Alain Rostain. Since then the number of local groups and online communities has grown year by year, with a series of conferences, regional events and roadshows in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia.

"Charles H. Grosvenor

Charles Henry Grosvenor (September 20, 1833 – October 30, 1917) was a multiple-term U.S. Representative from Ohio, as well as a brigade commander in the Union Army during the American Civil War.

Biography
Grosvernor was born in Pomfret, Connecticut. He was the uncle of Charles Grosvenor Bond. In 1838, Grosvenor moved with his parents to southeastern Ohio, where he attended school in Athens County. He later taught school before studying law. He was admitted to the bar in 1857 and practiced in Athens.

During the Civil War, Grosvenor served in the 18th Ohio Infantry and was promoted through the ranks to colonel. He led his regiment at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863, and was a brigade commander in the division of Charles Cruft at the Battle of Nashville in December 1864. At the close of the war, Grosvenor was brevetted as a colonel in the Regular Army. He was mustered out of the volunteers on October 9, 1865. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Grosvenor for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.

Following the war, Grosvenor held diverse township and village offices. He served as a member of the State house of representatives from 1874–1878 and served as Speaker of the House for two years. He served as member of the board of trustees of the Ohio Soldiers' and Sailors' Orphans' Home in Xenia from April 1880 until 1888, and president of the board for five years.

Presidential elector for Grant/Wilson in 1872.
Presidential elector for Garfield/Arthur in 1880.

"Hindu Mahajana Sangam

The Hindu Mahajana Sangam () is an association of Indian workers. It is one of the Indian non-profitable organization at Penang, Malaysia which has been officially established in 1935 by waterfronts workers. Before 1935, it known as Kootakkadai ().

The name Mahajana comes from two words, maha meaning great and jana meaning people. So Mahajana can be described as great people in Tamil, though in Sanskrit, it is translated as great vehicle. The Indian workers who arrived here were farmers back home. They preferred to call themselves Kootakadai, because they work as a kootam () which is gang or group, rather than calling themselves coolies or labourers.

The Hindu Mahajana Sangam was established in 1935 after following the first consecration of the Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple in Queen Street which was held in 1933. It was established for religious observances, to promote education, social/cultural development, participates in the administration/development of the Sri Muthu Mariamman, Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani and act as union for the workers.

The sangam's madam (hall) located at 674, Jalan Kebun Bunga (formerly known as Waterfall Road) near the foothill of the Waterfall Arulmigu Balathandayuthapani hilltop temple, is named as Gandhiji Ashram in remembrance of Mahatma Gandhi on 22nd Feb 1948.

History
The Indian farmers for economic reasons came to Penang from South India in the early 18th Century to work in the Penang waterfront as labourers, they worked for the Indian merchants and contributed to the development of import and export spice trade in the Island.

There were also Tamil Indian freedom fighters Maruthu Pandiyar relatives and 72 soldiers were deported to Penang in the year 1802 by the Madras Presidency Government (British India Government).

Koottakadai
There were more than 2,000 workers and their dependents lived in the prewar houses in the town centre than known as simpang lelong or elam muchanthi in Tamil, today this area is known as Little India. They worked in groups/gangs (kootam in Tamil) each gang consist of 50 to 30 workers with a head (Thandal in Tamil) and a clerk (Kanakku Pillai in Tamil) in charge of daily working income account which will be divided and distributed to the workers at the end of the month. They worked for the Indian merchant houses in handling their goods in the import/export trade. These workers are referred to as Kootakadai as they work as a group (Kootam). There were more than 50 groups operating in the Weld Quay waterfront handling cargo in the tongkangs or wooden barges in the import and export trade. In the many open concrete fields in the town, some of the workers were involved in storing; drying and re-bagging of betel nuts imported from Indonesia for re-export. For the workers relaxation in the evening, the authorities operated 2 government toddy shops in the town centre, one in Market Lane/Muda Lane junction which still exist today and the other in King Street which was bombed by the Japanese during the 2nd World War, this site have been since rebuilt into a warehouse for the customs department. During the War many workers joined the Indian National Army. They also had a unique form of a gathering to raise emergency funds for their needs call Needs (Thaevai in Tamil)  where each worker contribute and his amount and name recorded and same amount return to him in another function.

Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple
In 1833 the workers founded the Queen Street Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple (The temple was renamed Arulmigu Mahamariamman Temple in 1980 by the Hindu Endowment Board).  The waterfront workers contributed to the development, construction and management of the Queen Street and Waterfall temples. The inner city Hindu population was mostly waterfront workers who established the Hindu Mahajana Sangam in 1935. The sangam was established with the main purpose of managing the Queen Street and Waterfall hilltop temples. The Queen street temple which was then managed by a few trustees appointed by the Board. One of these trustees was Mr K.V. Karuppiah Thandal, who became the inaugural secretary of the sangam.

The sangam was also involved in promoting religious observance, developing Tamil education and Indian culture. It was also involved in arbitrating disputes within the community which served as an avenue to discuss and address social problems affecting Indian workers. It set up a panchayat committee to solve these problems. The sangam started Tamil schools to educate the Tamil children, and was active in promoting cultural activities and religious practices.

Union for the workers
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam was a channel in bring up the grievances of the Indian community to the proper authorities and acted as a union for the workers until 1950, when the Waterfront Workers Union was formed. This later became known as the Weld Quay Workers Union. In the early 1970s, when the Government established the Penang Labour Board, the Weld Quay Workers Union was amalgamated with the Prai Cargo Handlers and the Penang Stevedores Union to form the Penang Port Workers Union, with its office in King Street.

The sangam's Hon. Secretary, the late K. V. Karuppiah Thandal, the head of one of the numerous groups of workers was a trustee of the Queen Street Sri Muthu Mariamman temple and the sangam members were regularly appointed to the Hindu Endowment Board and the members held various positions in the temples management committees and contributed to the temples development.

The sangam's President, the late Mr. M. Doraisamy Thevar JP, PJK was the last Hindu Endowment Board member representing the Hindu Mahajana Sangam and was also the chairman of the Temples Management Committee, which carried out the 2nd consecration ceremony of the Queen Street, Sri Muthu Mariamman Temple.

Between 1960s and 70s many of the workers living in the inner city became jobless due to the Indonesian confrontation and also because the Indian merchants began to reduce the usage of the tongkangs/barges in transporting cargo to vessels and used the newly built PPC Butterworth deepwater wharves in the mainland to be cost effective. Therefore, many of the workers due to lack of job opportunities and their expanded families gradually left the town centre for economic reasons to various parts of the Island, to the slums in the Weld Quay reclamation area, Noordin Street Flats, mainland and far South, some of them even left Penang permanently to settle in India.

Building
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam operated out of 47 Church Street from 1935 until 1947, when it moved to 40 Church Street. The sangam moved out of 40 Church Street in 1988 after the property was sold. It was then that it moved to its own building, the Gandhiji Ashram, at 674 Jalan Kebun Bunga.

Today it is based at the Gandhiji Ashram, a community hall at the foot of the Balathandayuthapani Temple near the Penang Botanic Gardens. The hall was built by the early Indian settles who were the waterfront workers in late 1920s and was originally known as Madaalayam or Kootakadai Madam.  The Sangam intends to preserve the Dewan Mahatma Gandhi building as a heritage building as in our view this is the only building that exist today which is based on the South Indian Architecture left in the whole of Malaysia. This building is of significant historic value need to be preserved for our future generation to appreciate our heritage.

Contributions
The Sangam to strengthen the religious beliefs in the community every year organizes various festivals and celebrations in Queen Street Sri Maha Mariamman Temple, Waterfall Sri Bala Thendayuthapani Hilltop temple, Penang Road Sri Kunj Bihari Krishna Temple and Dewan Mahatma Gandhi.

Dewan Mahatma Gandhi
The members of the Sangam built the hall (madam in Tamil) in the Waterfall Balathandayuthapani Temple compound to cater for the devotees attending the annual Thaipusam (during Jan/Feb) and the annual Chitraparuvam Festivals (during April/May). This is a rare heritage building representing the South Indian architecture. Not only Dewan Mahatma Gandhi is used as a religious retreat, it also provides shelter to estate workers who come to Penang during the festivals. Due to lack of transport and accommodation in the earlier years, the sangam provided free temporary accommodation for the devotees from outstation attending the festivals and free vegetarian lunch to the public. This tradition is still being carried out by the Sangam members till today. On 22 February 1948 during a condolences gathering for the late Mahatma Gandhi, the members unanimously named the Sangam's hall Dewan Mahatma Gandhi (Ganhdhiji Ashram).
On 5 October 2008, A ceremony was held at the Gandhiji Ashram to unveil a life size statue of Mahatma Gandhi. The ceremony was also to celebrate United Nation's International Day against violence and to commemorate the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. 
Beginning from August 2013, an exhibit of rare photographs of Mahatma Gandhi is open to the public from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, on every Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

Pillaiyar Temple
In 1951 the Sangam built the Pillaiyar Temple in the Waterfall Temple compound and held its first consecration ceremony. In the late 1970s the Hindu Endowment Board rebuilt this temple and renamed it Arulmigu Sri Ganesar Temple.

Chitraparuvam
The Hindu Mahajana Sangam, with notable among the festivals, the annual Chitraparuvam Festival which is celebrated in the Tamil month of Chithirai (April/May) every year, is organised with a chariot procession of the Panchaloha () deity of Lord Subramaniyaswami from Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman Temple. It is the day of the first full moon of the first Tamil month. In early years, the festival starts with special pooja and ubayam for the Hindu Mahajana Sangam (Koota Kadai) in Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple, the chariot procession commences in the early morning 7.00 am and reached Waterfall Dewan Mahatma Gandhi (Gandhiji Ashram) in the afternoon, the deity then carried and placed in the ashram until the return journey of the chariot to Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple in the evening of the same day.

Since the early 1970s this festival is celebrated for three days. The deity of Lord Subramaiyaswami is brought in procession from the Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple passing through many street and roads before reaching the Waterfall Arulmigu Sri Ganesha temple. The deity is carried up to the Hilltop Arulmigu Sri Balathadayuthapani Temple. On the second day is the Chitraparuvam Festival where the deity is taken in procession around the hilltop temple compound in the evening. On the third day evening, the deity is carried down and placed on the chariot procession journey back to the Queen Street Sri Mahamariamman temple. In 1992, the Hindu Mahajana Sangam imported a new chariot from India, for the annual Chitraparuvam festival celebration to replace the old chariot which was found to be not road worthy and in a decaying condition.

On the first day, the chariot passes through Queen Street, Chulia Street, Chulia Street Ghaut, Victoria Street, Prangin Road Ghaut, C. Y. Choy Road, Magazine Road, Dato Keramat Road, Western Road and Waterfall Road before reaching the Ganesar Temple.

Navarathiri 
The Navarathiri festival begins with the lion flag raising ceremony and ends with a procession where the Panchaloha () deity of Mahamariamman is paraded in a decorated wooden chariot through the streets of Little India. Navarathiri is nine nights’ vegetarian festival. According to the Hindu Puranas, the festival is held to commemorate the victory of Goddess Adi Parashakti over the demon king Mahishasuran. It was stated that the evil king ill-treated the people that they turned to the goddess, who is the consort of Lord Shiva, to save them. Goddess Adi Parasakthi fought a battle for nine days and ultimately destroyed him on the 10th day, which is known as Vijayadashami.

Various Indian organisations and communities would sponsor the prayers for each of the nights. On the Final tenth day of the celebration, Vijayadashami is celebrated by Hindu Mahajana Sangam. The sangam organised the chariot procession for many years from Queen Street, Sri Mahamariamman Temple to Dhoby Ghaut. The festival celebration is concluded after shooting of arrows from the chariot in the evening in the Dhoby Ghaut. The chariot returns to the temple at about midnight the same day. Since the late 1970s, the organisation of the chariot procession had been taken over from the sangam by the Temple committee and the Hindu Endowments Board. The chariot procession is now confined to Fort Cornwallis area, nearby the Kedah Pier Muneeswarar Temple in the Esplanade. However, the sangam still continues to celebrate the annual Navarathiri festival's final tenth day Vijayadashami Ubayam every year without fail.

Free lunch is provided on the day before, in the evening light food and drinks served to the public. On Thaipusam day, free breakfast, lunch and dinner is served to the public.

A late night dinner is served in the Dewan Mahatma Gandhi after the arrival of the Atta Kavadi. In the early years the arrival of the Atta Kavadi signifies the conclusion of the annual Thaipusam festival celebration for the day and devotees are not expected to carry any kavadi after the Atta Kavadi reaches the Waterfall temple compound.

"Caffè crema

Caffè crema (Italian: ""cream coffee"") refers to two different coffee drinks:
 An old name for espresso (1940s and 1950s).
 A long espresso drink served primarily in Germany, Switzerland and Austria and northern Italy (1980s onwards), along the Italian/Swiss and Italian/Austrian border. In Germany it is generally known as a ""Café Crème""  or just ""Kaffee"" and is generally the default type of black coffee served, unless there is a filter machine.
As a colorful term it generally means ""espresso"", while in technical discussions, referring to the long drink, it may more narrowly be referred to as Swiss caffè crema. In addition, there's also Italian iced crema caffè.

Variant terms include ""crema caffè"" and the hyperforeignism ""café crema"" – ""café"" is French, while ""caffè"" and ""crema"" are Italian, thus ""café crema"" mixes French and Italian.

Synonym for espresso 

""Caffè crema"", and the English calque ""cream coffee"", was the original term for modern espresso, produced by hot water under pressure, coined in 1948 by Gaggia to describe the light brown foam (crema) on espresso. The term has fallen out of use in favor of ""espresso"".

As a colorful synonym for ""espresso"", the term and variants find occasional use in coffee branding, as in ""Jacobs Caffè Crema"" and ""Kenco Café Crema"".

In Italy caffè crema is sometimes used for a crema rich espresso.

Swiss drink 
The term ""caffè crema"" also refers to a long espresso drink, popular since the 1980s in Switzerland and northern Italy. It is generally served as the standard ""café traditionnel"" in Belgium. It is produced by running  of water when brewing an espresso, primarily by using a coarser grind. It is similar to a caffè Americano or a long black, except that these latter are diluted espresso, and consist of making (""pulling"") a normal (short) espresso shot and combining it with unbrewed hot water. By contrast, a caffè crema extracts differently, and thus has a different flavor profile.

As a long, brewed rather than diluted, espresso, caffè crema is the long end of the ristretto – normale – lungo – caffè crema range, and is significantly longer than a lungo, generally twice as long. Rough brewing ratios of ristretto, normale, lungo, and caffè crema are 1:2:3:6 – a doppio ristretto will be approximately 1 oz/30 ml (crema increases the volume), normale 2 oz/60 ml, lungo 3 oz/90 ml, and caffè crema 6 oz/180 ml. However, volumes of caffè crema can vary significantly, from 4–8 oz (120 ml–240 ml) for a double shot, depending on how it is brewed and taste, and there is no widely agreed standard measure in the English-speaking world. In terms of solubles concentration, a caffè crema is approximately midway between a lungo and non-pressure brewed coffee, such as drip or press.

The motivation for the caffè crema is that it produces a traditional large cup of coffee, just as brewed coffee does: the small size of espresso is due to the original Gaggia lever espresso machine of 1948 requiring manual pressure, and thus a single (solo) espresso of  was the maximum that could practically be extracted. The development of pump-driven espresso in the 1961 Faema removed this restriction, but by then a taste had developed for the short espresso, and these continued to be produced on the new machines, long caffè crema only emerging in the 1980s.

The caffè crema is not a common drink in the English-speaking world and is virtually never available in cafés because of the need to significantly change the grind compared to standard espresso. Cafés instead serve Americanos or long blacks. The caffè crema was briefly used in Australia in the 1980s, but was replaced by the long black.

Brewing method 
As the caffè crema is very uncommon in the English-speaking world, and not widely available outside of home brewing, there are few English-language resources on how to brew it, nor consistency in what precisely is understood by this. What is generally done is to coarsen the grind, but otherwise extract in much the same way as espresso, stopping the shot when it blonds, as is usual for espresso – the coarser grind resulting in greater volume, but the extraction taking approximately the same time (25–30 seconds). Some variants include tamping less or extracting for slightly longer (35–40 seconds), and coarser grinds generally result in less mass of grinds fitting into a given filter basket, leading some to prefer using triple-shot baskets to allow sufficient coffee.

One can make a caffè crema in a commercial setting by using the existing filter grind, which is approximately correct, in the espresso machine and otherwise brewing normally, but this would be a very unusual request.

Crema caffè 
In Italy, during the summer, traditional cafés (called bar, without final s,  in Italian) commonly serve an iced, creamy variant of espresso called crema caffè, crema fredda di caffè and so on. This requires a special spinning apparatus making it constantly creamy, without ice scales. It can be served straight or with panna (milk cream).

"Trans-Sahelian Highway

The Trans-Sahelian Highway or Trans-Sahel Highway is a transnational highway project to pave, improve and ease border formalities on a highway route through the southern fringes of the Sahel region in West Africa between Dakar, Senegal in the west and Ndjamena, Chad, in the east. Alternative names for the highway are the Dakar-Ndjamena Highway or Ndjamena-Dakar Highway and it is Trans-African Highway 5 in the Trans-African Highway network.

The highway passes though seven countries and five national capitals, and links regions of similar climate and environment which have cultural and trade links going back centuries. It is one of two east-west transnational links in West Africa and runs inland from and, for most of its length, roughly parallel to the Trans–West African Coastal Highway with a separation of about .

Route and status

Overall features, length and condition
The Trans-Sahelian Highway has a length of about  running through Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, and the far northern tip of Cameroon, ending at Ndjamena just inside the western border of Chad. All but about , mostly in western Mali, has been paved, but extensive sections elsewhere require rehabilitation or are currently under reconstruction. Most of the route uses existing national highways, but an optional route requires construction of a completely new road between Senegal and Mali.

Detail of sections
The cities and countries served, and status of the road are as follows (going east):
In Senegal, Dakar to Tambacounda,  , paved,  in poor condition; this road has been paved for several decades.
Linking Senegal and Mali between Tambacounda and Bamako, two options were proposed in the 2005 consultants' report
 a shorter more direct southern route via Saraya and Kita, about , using about  of road paved in the 1990s of which most was in good condition, and requiring construction of  of new road and the paving of  of earth road;
a longer northern route of about  via Kayes, Diéma and Didjeni, utilising national roads of Mali which are paved.

In south-eastern Mail, Bamako to Sikasso via Bougouni, , paved before 1990 and in fair condition.

Sikasso to Koloko at the Burkina Faso border, paved and in fair condition.

Burkina Faso section:  via Bobo-Dioulasso, Ouagadougou, Koupéla, and Fada Ngourma, paved and in good condition except for  paved section before the Niger border, due to be rehabilitated in 2003-5;

Niger section:  of which  was in poor condition, via Niamey, Dosso, Dogondoutchi, Birnin-Konni and Maradi to the Nigerian border at Jibiya.

Nigeria section: , all paved and in fair condition, via Katsina, Kano, Kari, Maiduguri and Dikwa.

The short Cameroon section consists of an  unpaved gravel road from the Nigerian border to Maltam which is impassable in the wet season; as this road is not used by local traffic to any extent, Cameroon has no plans to upgrade it. The  section from Maltam to Kousseri at the Chad border is paved and is used mainly by Chadian traffic.

Chad: the highway is fairly complete except for the last 150km from Abeche to the Sudanese border town of Adre and a small gap within the city limits of Mongo. It is in need of some maintenance in some areas as the surface has become broken up.  There is regular bus service from the capital NDjamena to Abeche every day.

Alternative routes at the eastern end:
 the alternative to the unpaved section through Cameroon is a route which adds about  on paved roads via Bama in Nigeria and Mora and Waza in Cameroon.
an alternative route of about  between Niger and Chad, by-passing Nigeria, will be possible when a proposed new road around the north and east of Lake Chad is built connecting Ndjamena to Nguigmi which is about  inside Niger. Nguigmi is connected by a paved road via Zinder to Maradi where it meets the Trans-Sahelian Highway.

Links to other transnational highways
The Trans-Sahelian Highway intersects with the following Trans-African Highways:
 =Cairo-Dakar Highway}} in Dakar
  in Dakar
  in Kano, Nigeria
  in Ndjamena, with which it will form a complete east-west crossing of the continent of .

The northern regions of Guinea, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Togo, and Benin are close to the Trans-Sahelian Highway, which may be used to by travellers between those regions in preference to the Trans–West African Coastal Highway further south. Paved roads connect the Trans-Sahelian and West African Coastal Highways through
 Côte d'Ivoire (Sikassa or Bobo-Dioulasso to Yamoussoukro)
Ghana (Ouagadougou to Accra)
Togo (Koupela to Lomé)
Benin (Dosso to Cotonou)
Nigeria (Birnin-Konni or Kano to Lagos).

"Madonna and Child with Saint Mary Magdalene and Saint Ursula

Madonna and Child with Saint Mary Magdalene and Saint Ursula or Virgin and Child with Saints Magdalene and Ursula is an oil on panel painting by Giovanni Bellini that belongs to the sacra conversazione genre and dates to 1490. The painting is also referred to as Sacred Conversation. It was previously in the collection of the painter Carlo Maratta, and is now in the Prado Museum in Madrid.

It is very similar to the same artist's Madonna and Child with Saint Catherine and Saint Mary Magdalene in the Gallerie dell'Accademia; they both formed part of a group of paintings which show the popularity of the genre, with several replicas, mostly from Bellini's studio or only partly by his own hand, including those in Urbino and the Pierrepont Morgan Library in New York. The Madrid example shows saint Mary Magdalene and saint Ursula.

"Odostomia tropidita

Odostomia tropidita is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.

Description
The white shell has a pupiform shape. Its length measures 2.5 mm. The  1½ whorls of the protoconch form a moderately elevated helicoid spire, whose axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which it is about one-third immersed. The seven whorls of the teleoconch are moderately rounded, somewhat contracted at the sutures, and strongly tabulated on the summits. They are marked by rounded, weak, axial ribs of which eight occur upon the first and second, ten upon the third, twelve upon the fourth and fifth, and fourteen upon the penultimate turn. The intercostal spaces are broad and shallow. The periphery of the body whorl and base are well rounded. They are marked by the continuation of the ribs. The aperture is broadly oval. The outer lip is thin. The columella is slender and slightly curved.

Distribution
The type species was found off the Isle of Pearls, Bay of Panama.

"Wellington Rape Crisis

Wellington Rape Crisis is a support centre for survivors of rape and sexual abuse, their families and friends. It was founded in 1977 as part of a wave of foundations across New Zealand in the early to mid 1970s. Their work includes advocacy, education for public and counselling for survivors. In 2008 Wellington Rape Crisis received charitable status from the Charities Commission.

Advocacy
Wellington Rape Crisis advocates against sexual violence and rape culture.

In 2012, pizza company Hell Pizza faced controversy when they ran a ""Confessional"" competition on Facebook. The winner described an incident of sexual assault where he put his penis inside the mouth of a drunk person who was passed out. This was met with a huge number of complaints and criticisms across Facebook and Twitter. Hell Pizza blamed a social media manager and removed the post. However they subsequently donated $10,000 to Wellington Rape Crisis and matched donations made to the agency that month dollar for dollar. At the time Wellington Rape Crisis were being forced to cut services, closing their doors on Fridays due to a $55,000.00 funding shortfall. Wellington Rape Crisis experienced an increase in client numbers and were faced with a difficult funding environment. The funding was accepted by the agency on the condition that Hell Pizza's executives, staff and managers do sexual violence awareness and bystander intervention training provided by the Sexual Abuse Prevention Network.

News of the Roast Busters scandal first broke in November 2013. A group of young men based in Auckland allegedly intoxicated underage girls to gang rape them. The lack of police response to the issue and the line of questioning they took when interviewing the complainants sparked a large public outcry. Wellington Rape Crisis condemned the behavior of the young boys as abhorrent and denounced the rape culture in New Zealand. Agency Manager Natalie Gousmett said:

This whole situation is horrific. First we have the abhorrent behavior of the members of the rape group, causing serious harm to the victims they have targeted. Then we have appalling coverage by media, including extreme victim-blaming and today we have heard the Police have indeed had complaints yet have only just started taking action now.

In November 2015 New Zealand Prime Minister John Key accused the opposition party of “Backing rapists.” In response to these claims several female MPs stood up and shared their own experiences of sexual violence and voiced their offence to the Prime Minister's comments. They were subsequently thrown out of Parliament by the Speaker of the House. Spokesperson for Wellington Rape Crisis Eleanor Butterworth said the Prime Minister's comments were not helpful. She said “It was not only harmful for survivors to have rape used as a political football, but also for the families of people who have been sexually abused.

Awards
2013 Wellington Rape Crisis received The Dominion Post Choice Charities Award. The winners were chosen by the public. The award included a $10,000 prize comprising $5000 cash and $5000 worth of advertising.

"Bakers Pit

Bakers Pit is a phreatic maze cave system near Buckfastleigh, Devon, England.

It was first opened in 1847 by quarrying activities.

Bakers Pit is entered via a vertical descent of 16 metres. It has  of passage contained within an area of  and a small stream, flowing to the River Dart, that is still actively developing the cave. It was once connected to Reeds cave, however, only ""voice"" connection is currently possible, and only in a few locations. Connections between the two systems have been filled in with concrete to protect the beautiful formations in the Reeds cave.

The cave was much frequented between the wars by local people during which time many of the calcite formations were destroyed, although there are signs that there is some active regeneration.
In the early 1960s an upper series was discovered significantly extending the known cave by as much as 50 per cent by climbing a vertical slot in the roof. This extension is better known as plymouth extension and contains the best examples of cave formations due to its extremely difficult access of squeezes and climbs. This upper series once went up to the surface but for conservation this has been sealed off with an emergency plan in place in case of rescue from this upper series..

Wildlife
Devon caves are good places to find humidity-loving collembola and Pseudosinella dobati (a blind white cave-adapted species), Symphyla isabellae, Tetracanthella britannica and Heteromurus nitidus have been recorded in Baker's Pit. Other invertebrates include the staphilinid beetle Quedius mesomelinus and the arachnid Lessertia denticalis.

"Mondini dysplasia

Mondini dysplasia, also known as Mondini malformation and Mondini defect, is an abnormality of the inner ear that is associated with sensorineural hearing loss.

This deformity was first described in 1791 by Mondini after examining the inner ear of a deaf boy. The Mondini dysplasia describes a cochlea with incomplete partitioning and a reduced number of turns, an enlarged vestibular aqueduct and a dilated vestibule.  A normal cochlea has two and a half turns, a cochlea with Mondini dysplasia has one and a half turns; the basal turns being normally formed with a dilated or cystic apical turn to the cochlear. The hearing loss can deteriorate over time either gradually or in a step-wise fashion, or may be profound from birth.

Hearing loss associated with Mondini dysplasia may first become manifest in childhood or early adult life.  Some children may pass newborn hearing screen to lose hearing in infancy but others present with a hearing loss at birth. Hearing loss is often progressive and because of the associated widened vestibular aqueduct may progress in a step-wise fashion associated with minor head trauma. Vestibular function is also often affected. While the hearing loss is sensorineural a conductive element may exist probably because of the third window effect of the widened vestibular aqueduct. The Mondini dysplasia can occur in cases of Pendred Syndrome and Branchio-oto-renal syndrome and in other syndromes, but can occur in non-syndromic deafness.

"Nick VanderLaan

Nicholas James ""Nick"" VanderLaan (born October 27, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player. He played three seasons of Division I college basketball for California and Virginia before completing his college career at Concordia-Irvine in 2004. As a senior in 2003–04, he was named an NAIA All-American First Team honoree. He played professionally for three seasons, spending time in the American Basketball Association (ABA), Continental Basketball Association (CBA), NBA Development League and in the Spanish second-tier league (LEB). His best season came in 2007, when he led the CBA in rebounding and helped Ricoh Manresa win the LEB championship.

High school career
A Sacramento native, VanderLaan first attended high school in his hometown before completing his secondary education in Connecticut. Following his sophomore year at Kennedy High School in 1997, VanderLaan moved to Kent, Connecticut for his junior year. As a junior at Kent School in 1997–98, he was named the MVP of the school's basketball team after averaging 26 points and 15 rebounds per game. During the season, he had a quadruple-double with 48 points, 22 rebounds, 11 blocks and 10 assists in a 101–97 double-overtime victory.

On November 17, 1998, VanderLaan signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the University of California, Berkeley.

As a senior at Oakdale's St. Thomas More School in 1998–99, VanderLaan averaged 19 points and 14 rebounds per game. He was named co-MVP of a team that finished with a 28–4 overall record and a second-place finish in the Class A New England Prep School tournament.

In high school, VanderLaan also played football as a tight end and defensive end.

College career

California (1999–2001)
As a freshman at California in 1999–2000, VanderLaan played in 33 games and had 16 starting assignments. He averaged 8.5 points and 6.7 rebounds per game, becoming only the fourth Cal freshman to have at least 200 rebounds. He was Cal's leading rebounder in 15 of the team's final 23 games, and finished the season second on the team in rebounding. He earned All-Tournament honors at the Top of the World Classic in Alaska after making his collegiate debut with a 20-point performance against Texas Christian, and scoring a career-high 23 points two games later in the title game against Oklahoma. At the season's end, he was named an honorable mention for the Pac-10 All-Freshman team.

As a sophomore in 2000–01, VanderLaan played in 29 of Cal's 31 games and had 21 starting assignments. He averaged 6.2 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, finishing as Cal's second-leading rebounder for the second consecutive season. On December 21, 2000, VanderLaan recorded his only double-double of the season with 14 points and 12 rebounds in an 85–64 win over Georgia. VanderLaan started 21-straight games for Cal in 2000–01, but lost his starting job to Solomon Hughes in the final three weeks of Pac-10 play after he missed two games in February with a sprained right ankle.

In March 2001, VanderLaan decided to transfer to another school for his junior year, citing personal reasons.

Virginia (2001–2003)
In May 2001, VanderLaan transferred to the University of Virginia. He was forced to sit out the 2001–02 season due to NCAA transfer regulations, but was able to practice with the team.

As a redshirted junior in 2002–03, VanderLaan averaged 5.3 points and 4.5 rebounds in 31 games for the Cavaliers. He again finished second on the team in rebounding. He shot 50.8 percent (64-of-126) from the field, scored in double figures five times, and started in 14 games. On December 19, 2002, he scored a season-high 17 points against Gardner–Webb. Two days later, he had a season-high 11 rebounds against Rutgers.

Concordia-Irvine (2003–2004)
In August 2003, VanderLaan transferred from Virginia to Concordia University Irvine, moving again because of limited playing time with the Cavaliers in 2002–03. With one year of eligibility remaining, he had to play in a program that was not NCAA Division I. As a senior playing for the Eagles in 2003–04, he was named to the All-GSAC Team and received GSAC Player of the Year honors. He was also named an NAIA All-American First Team honoree and earned NAIA All-Tournament Team honors. On February 9, 2004, he was named GSAC Player of the Week after leading the Eagles to two wins with averages of 21.5 points and 11.5 rebounds. VanderLaan helped lead Concordia-Irvine to the final of the 2004 NAIA Tournament, where they were defeated 74–70 by Mountain State University despite an 18-point, 11-rebound effort from VanderLaan. He played and started in all 38 games for the Eagles in 2003–04, averaging team highs in points (16.1) and rebounds (11.6), while also averaging 1.2 assists, 1.0 blocks and 0.9 steals per game. He set a new single-season and school record with 29 double-doubles.

After going undrafted in the 2004 NBA draft, VanderLaan joined the Golden State Warriors in July 2004 for the Southern California Summer Pro League. He appeared in four out of six games for the Warriors during the tournament, with his best performance coming in the team's final game, where he recorded 10 points and eight rebounds in 21 minutes off the bench.

ABA (2004–2005)
VanderLaan joined the newly established Utah Snowbears for their inaugural season in the American Basketball Association (ABA). He played in the team's first two games of the season (November 19–20) before being placed on the injured list on November 24 and replaced on the active roster by former NBA player Tony Farmer.

In January 2005, VanderLaan was tested by Polish team Anwil Włocławek. He did not play for Włocławek during his stint with the team, and upon returning to the United States, he joined the ABA's Long Beach Jam. He made his debut for the Jam on January 28, recording two points, four rebounds and one block in a 139–114 win over Tijuana. He played out the season with the Jam and helped them finish with a 20–11 overall record, after they went 18–10 in the regular season and 2–1 in the post-season. Their final game came on March 9, where despite a double-digit scoring effort from VanderLaan, the Jam were defeated 130–115 by his former team, the Utah Snowbears.

Idaho Stampede (2005)
On November 6, 2005, VanderLaan signed with the Idaho Stampede of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). He recorded six points and 10 rebounds over the Stampede's first three games of the season before being waived on November 22.

Butte Daredevils (2006–2007)
On November 2, 2006, VanderLaan returned to the CBA, signing with the Butte Daredevils for the 2006–07 season. On January 23, 2007, he was named CBA Player of the Week for the week of January 16–22. He averaged 11 points and 16 rebounds in three games during the week, highlighted by a league-high 25-rebound performance. Later that month, he was named in the National Conference All-Star team for the 23rd Annual CBA All-Star Classic. In the All-Star Game on February 6, VanderLaan grabbed a game-high 16 rebounds and helped the National Conference defeat the American Conference 134–131 in overtime. In the Daredevils' season finale on March 25, VanderLaan had a double-double with 13 points and a game-high 17 rebounds in a 110–103 win over the Great Falls Explorers. The Daredevils finished their first season in the CBA with a 21–27 record, good for third place in the National Conference. VanderLaan appeared in 47 of the team's 48 games in 2006–07, making 43 starts and averaging 13.0 points, a league-leading 11.7 rebounds, and 1.3 assists in 31.1 minutes per game. He also shot 53.8% from the field and 69.3% from the free throw line. VanderLaan subsequently earned All-CBA Second Team honors.

Los Angeles D-Fenders (2007)
On April 3, 2007, VanderLaan was acquired by the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA Development League. He made his debut for the D-Fenders that night, recording 10 points, eight rebounds, six assists, one steal and one block in 25 minutes off the bench in a 121–104 win over the Albuquerque Thunderbirds. He appeared in the D-Fenders' last five games of the season, and in their season finale on April 14, he recorded 15 points and a D-Fenders season-high 19 rebounds in a 90–83 loss to the Idaho Stampede. The D-Fenders missed the playoffs in 2006–07 with a 23–27 record. Over his five-game stint in the D-League, VanderLaan averaged 12.6 points, 12.4 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 31 minutes per game.

Ricoh Manresa (2007)
On April 30, 2007, VanderLaan signed with Spanish team Ricoh Manresa for their LEB playoff run. He helped Manresa go undefeated (7–0) in the playoffs, as they made it through to the final where they defeated Climalia León 94–88 to claim the LEB championship. VanderLaan appeared in all seven playoff games for Manresa, averaging 3.9 points and 2.7 rebounds in 8.0 minutes per game.

New Jersey Nets (2007)
On July 3, 2007, VanderLaan was named in a 14-man New Jersey Nets roster for the Orlando Pro Summer League, but due to injury, he did not make an appearance for the Nets during the five-day (July 9–13) tournament.

Post-playing career
An injury forced his retirement from basketball in 2007. In 2010, VanderLaan joined the men's basketball coaching staff of Concordia University Irvine as an assistant to long-time head coach Ken Ammann. He departed after just one season.

"Landsat 8

Landsat 8 is an American Earth observation satellite launched on February 11, 2013. It is the eighth satellite in the Landsat program; the seventh to reach orbit successfully. Originally called the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), it is a collaboration between NASA and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, provided development, mission systems engineering, and acquisition of the launch vehicle while the USGS provided for development of the ground systems and will conduct on-going mission operations.

The satellite was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation, who served as prime contractor for the mission. The spacecraft's instruments were constructed by Ball Aerospace and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, and its launch was contracted to United Launch Alliance.
During the first 108 days in orbit, LDCM underwent checkout and verification by NASA and on 30 May 2013 operations were transferred from NASA to the USGS when LDCM was officially renamed to Landsat 8.

Mission overview 
With Landsat 5 retiring in early 2013, leaving Landsat 7 as the only on-orbit Landsat program satellite, Landsat 8 ensures the continued acquisition and availability of Landsat data utilizing a two-sensor payload, the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS). Respectively, these two instruments collect image data for nine shortwave bands and two longwave thermal bands. The satellite was developed with a 5.25 years mission design life but was launched with enough fuel on board to provide for upwards of ten years of operations.

Landsat 8 consists of three key mission and science objectives:

 Collect and archive medium resolution (30-meter spatial resolution) multispectral image data affording seasonal coverage of the global landmasses for a period of no less than 5 years;
 Ensure that Landsat 8 data are sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier Landsat missions in terms of acquisition geometry, calibration, coverage characteristics, spectral characteristics, output product quality, and data availability to permit studies of landcover and land-use change over time;
 Distribute Landsat 8 data products to the general public on a nondiscriminatory basis at no cost to the user.

Technical details 

Providing moderate-resolution imagery, from 15 meters to 100 meters, of Earth's land surface and polar regions, Landsat 8 operates in the visible, near-infrared, short wave infrared, and thermal infrared spectrums. Landsat 8 captures more than 700 scenes a day, an increase from the 250 scenes a day on Landsat 7. The OLI and TIRS sensors will see improved signal to noise (SNR) radiometric performance, enabling 12-bit quantization of data allowing for more bits for better land-cover characterization.

Planned parameters for Landsat 8 standard products

Spacecraft 
The Landsat 8 spacecraft was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation, under contract to NASA, and uses Orbital's standard LEOStar-3 satellite bus. Orbital was responsible for the design and manufacture of the Landsat 8 spacecraft bus, the integration of the customer-furnished payload instruments, and full observatory testing, including environmental and EMI/EMC. The spacecraft supplies power, orbit and attitude control, communications, and data storage for OLI and TIRS.

All components, except for the propulsion module, are mounted on the exterior of the primary structure. A single deployable solar array generates power for the spacecraft components and charges the spacecraft's 125 amp-hour nickel-hydrogen (Ni-H2) battery. A 3.14-terabit solid state data recorder provides data storage aboard the spacecraft and an X-band antenna transmits OLI and TIRS data either in real time or played back from the data recorder. The OLI and TIRS are mounted on an optical bench at the forward end of the spacecraft.

Sensors

Operational Land Imager 

Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) improves on past Landsat sensors and was built, under contract to NASA, by Ball Aerospace. OLI uses a technological approach demonstrated by the Advanced Land Imager sensor flown on NASA's experimental EO-1 satellite. The OLI instrument uses a pushbroom sensor instead of whiskbroom sensors that were utilized on earlier Landsat satellites. The pushbroom sensor aligns the imaging detector arrays along Landsat 8's focal plane allowing it to view across the entire swath, 115 miles (185 kilometers) cross-track field of view, as opposed to sweeping across the field of view. With over 7,000 detectors per spectral band, the pushbroom design results in increased sensitivity, fewer moving parts, and improved land surface information.

OLI collects data from nine spectral bands. Seven of the nine bands are consistent with the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors found on earlier Landsat satellites, providing for compatibility with the historical Landsat data, while also improving measurement capabilities. Two new spectral bands, a deep blue coastal / aerosol band and a shortwave-infrared cirrus band, will be collected, allowing scientists to measure water quality and improve detection of high, thin clouds.

Thermal InfraRed Sensor 

The Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS), built by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, conducts thermal imaging and supports emerging applications such as evapotranspiration rate measurements for water management. The TIRS focal plane uses GaAs Quantum Well Infrared Photodetector arrays (known as QWIPs) for detecting the infrared radiation—a first for the Landsat program.  The TIRS data will be registered to OLI data to create radiometrically, geometrically, and terrain-corrected 12-bit Landsat 8 data products. Like OLI, TIRS employs a pushbroom sensor design with a 185 kilometer swath width. Data for two long wavelength infrared bands will be collected with TIRS. This provides data continuity with Landsat 7's single thermal IR band and adds a second.

With TIRS being a late addition to the Landsat 8 satellite, the design life requirement was relaxed in order to expedite development of the sensor. As such, TIRS only has a three-year design life.

Ground system 

The Landsat 8 ground system performs two main functions: command and control of the satellite and management of mission data sent from the satellite. Satellite command and control is provided by the Mission Operations Center at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center. Commands are sent from the Mission Operations Center to the satellite via a Ground Network Element (GNE). Mission data from the satellite is downlinked to receiving stations in Sioux Falls, SD, Gilmore Creek, AK, and Svalbard, Norway. From there, the data is sent via the GNE to the USGS Earth Resource Observation and Science (EROS) Center in Sioux Falls, where it is ingested into the Data Processing and Archive System.

History 
The original Landsat 8 plans called for NASA to purchase data meeting Landsat 8 specifications from a commercially owned and operated satellite system; however, after an evaluation of proposals received from industry, NASA cancelled the Request for Proposals in September 2003. In August 2004, a memorandum from the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) directed Federal agencies to place Landsat-type sensors on the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) platform. Following an evaluation of the technical complexity of this task, the strategy was adjusted and on December 23, 2005, the OSTP issued a memorandum directing NASA to implement the Landsat 8 in the form of a free-flyer spacecraft carrying an instrument referred to as the Operational Land Imager (OLI). In December 2009, a decision was made to add a thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) to the mission payload.

Launch 

The satellite was launched aboard an Atlas V 401 carrier rocket with an Extended Payload Fairing. The launch took place at 18:02 UTC (10:02 PST) on 11 February 2013, from Space Launch Complex 3E at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Seventy eight minutes and thirty seconds later, the spacecraft separated from the Atlas V upper stage, successfully completing the launch.

First images from the spacecraft were collected on March 18, 2013. Landsat 8 joins Landsat 7 on-orbit, providing increased coverage of the Earth's surface.

On orbit problems with TIRS 
On December 19, 2014, ground controllers detected anomalous current levels associated with the scene select mirror (SSM) encoder electronics. The SSM electronics were turned off with the instrument pointed at nadir and TIRS data was acquired but not processed. On March 3, 2015, operators switched TIRS from the A side to B side electronics to deal with the issue with the A side encoder electronics. TIRS resumed normal operations on March 4, 2015, and nominal blackbody and deep space calibration data collection resumed on March 7, 2015. On November 3, 2015, TIRS ability to accurately measure the location of the Scene Select Mirror (SSM) was compromised and the encoder was powered off. In April 2016, an algorithm was developed to compensate for the powered off encoder and data reporting resumed. In addition to these problems, TIRS launched with a stray light anomaly that increases the reported temperature by up to four degrees Celsius in band 10 and up to 8 degrees Celsius in band 11. Eventually it was determined that the anomaly was caused by out-of-field reflections bouncing off a metal alloy retaining ring mounted just above the third lens of the four-lens refractive TIRS telescope and onto the TIRS focal plane. In January 2017, an algorithm was developed to estimate the amount of stray light and subtract it from the data, reducing the error down to about 1 Kelvin.

"Self-perception theory

Self-perception theory (SPT) is an account of attitude formation developed by psychologist Daryl Bem. It asserts that people develop their attitudes (when there is no previous attitude due to a lack of experience, etc.—and the emotional response is ambiguous) by observing their own behavior and concluding what attitudes must have caused it. The theory is counterintuitive in nature, as the conventional wisdom is that attitudes determine behaviors. Furthermore, the theory suggests that people induce attitudes without accessing internal cognition and mood states. The person interprets their own overt behaviors rationally in the same way they attempt to explain others' behaviors.

Bem's original experiment
In an attempt to decide if individuals induce their attitudes as observers without accessing their internal states, Bem used interpersonal simulations, in which an ""observer-participant"" is given a detailed description of one condition of a cognitive dissonance experiment. Subjects listened to a tape of a man enthusiastically describing a tedious peg-turning task.

Subjects were told that the man had been paid $20 for his testimonial and another group was told that he was paid $1. Those in the latter condition thought that the man must have enjoyed the task more than those in the $20 condition. The results obtained were similar to the original Festinger-Carlsmith experiment. Because the observers, who did not have access to the actors' internal cognition and mood states, were able to infer the true attitude of the actors, it is possible that the actors themselves also arrive at their attitudes by observing their own behavior. Specifically, Bem notes how ""the attitude statements which comprise the major dependent variables in dissonance experiments may be regarded as interpersonal judgments in which the observer and the observed happen to be the same individual.""

Further evidence
There are numerous studies conducted by psychologists that support the self-perception theory, demonstrating that emotions do follow behaviors. For example, it is found that corresponding emotions (including liking, disliking, happiness, anger, etc.) were reported following from their overt behaviors, which had been manipulated by the experimenters. These behaviors included making different facial expressions, gazes, and postures. In the end of the experiment, subjects inferred and reported their affections and attitudes from their practiced behaviors despite the fact that they were told previously to act that way. These findings are consistent with the James–Lange theory of emotion.

In 1974, James Laird conducted two experiments on how changes in facial expression can trigger changes in emotion. Participants were asked to contract or relax various facial muscles, causing them to smile or frown without awareness of the nature of their expressions. Participants reported feeling more angry when frowning and happier when smiling. They also reported that cartoons viewed while they were smiling were more humorous than cartoons viewed while they were frowning. Furthermore, participants scored higher on aggression during frown trials than during smile trials, and scored higher on elation, surgency, and social affection factors during smile trials than during frown ones. Laird interpreted these results as ""indicating that an individual's expressive behavior mediates the quality of his emotional experience."" In other words, a person's facial expression can act as a cause of an emotional state, rather than an effect; instead of smiling because they feel happy, a person can make themselves feel happy by smiling.

In 2006, Tiffany Ito and her colleagues conducted two studies to investigate if changes in facial expression can trigger changes in racial bias. The explicit goal of the studies was to determine ""whether facial feedback can modulate implicit racial bias as assessed by the Implicit Association Test (IAT)."" Participants were surreptitiously induced to smile through holding a pencil in their mouth while viewing photographs of unfamiliar black or white males or performed no somatic configuration while viewing the photographs (Study 1 only). All participants then completed the IAT with no facial manipulation. Results revealed a spreading attitude effect; people made to smile (unconsciously) at pictures of black males showed less implicit prejudice than those made to smile at pictures of white males. Their attitudes change as a result of their behavior.

Chaiken and Baldwin's 1981 study on self-perception theory dealt with environmental attitudes. Each participant was identified as having well or poorly defined prior attitudes toward being an environmentalist or conservationist. Participants then completed one of two versions of a questionnaire designed to bring to mind either past pro-ecology behaviors or past anti-ecology behaviors. For example, questions such as ""Have you ever recycled?"" call to mind the times an individual has recycled, emphasizing their engagement in environmentalist behavior. On the other hand, questions like ""Do you always recycle?"" bring to mind all the times an individual did not recycle something, emphasizing a lack of environmentalist behavior. Afterward, participants' attitudes toward being an environmentalist/conservationist were re-measured. Those with strong initial/prior attitudes toward the environment were not really affected by the salient manipulation. Those with weak prior attitudes, however, were affected. At the end, those in the pro-ecology condition (""Have you ever recycled?"") reported themselves as being much more pro-environment than those in the anti-ecology condition (""Do you always recycle?""). Bringing to mind certain past behaviors affected what people believed their attitudes to be.

Evidence for the self-perception theory has also been seen in real life situations. After teenagers participated in repeated and sustained volunteering services, their attitudes were demonstrated to have shifted to be more caring and considerate towards others.

Recent research
Research incorporating self-perception theory has continued in recent years, appearing in conjunction with studies dealing with motivational ""crowding out,"" terrorism, mindwandering, and the inclusion of others in the self.

Guadagno and her fellow experimenters did a study in 2010 addressing the recruitment of new members by terrorist organization via the internet. In addition to looking at how such an organization might influence its targets to support more extreme ideologies (primarily through simple requests gradually increasing to larger commitments–an example of the foot-in-the-door technique), the authors looked at how ""the new converts may form increasingly radical attitudes to be consistent with their increasingly radical behavior."" Self-perception theory, then, has strong ties to social identity and social influence in this scenario.

Also in 2010, Clayton Critcher and Thomas Gilovich performed four studies to test a connection between self-perception theory and mindwandering. Self-perception theory posits that people determine their attitudes and preferences by interpreting the meaning of their own behavior. Critcher and Gilovich looked at whether people also rely on the unobservable behavior that is their mindwandering when making inferences about their attitudes and preferences. They found that ""Having the mind wander to positive events, to concurrent as opposed to past activities, and to many events rather than just one tends to be attributed to boredom and therefore leads to perceived dissatisfaction with an ongoing task."" Participants relied on the content of their wandering minds as a cue to their attitudes unless an alternative cause for their mindwandering was brought to their attention.

Similarly, Goldstein and Cialdini published work related to self-perception theory in 2007. In an extension of self-perception theory, the authors hypothesized that people sometimes infer their own attributes or attitudes by ""observing the freely chosen actions of others with whom they feel a sense of merged identity – almost as if they had observed themselves performing the acts."" Participants were made to feel a sense of merged identity with an actor through a perspective-taking task or feedback indicating overlapping brainwave patterns. Participants incorporated attributes relevant to the actor's behavior into their own self-concepts, leading participants to then change their own behaviors. The study addresses the self-expansion model: close relationships can lead to an inclusion of another person in an individual's sense of self.

Applications
One useful application of the self-perception theory is in changing attitude, both therapeutically and in terms of persuasion.

Psychological therapy

For therapies, self-perception theory holds a different view of psychological problems from the traditional perspectives. Traditionally, psychological problems come from the inner part of the clients. However, self-perception theory perspective suggests that people derive their inner feelings or abilities from their external behaviors. If those behaviors are maladjusted ones, people will attribute those maladjustments to their poor adapting abilities and thus suffer from the corresponding psychological problems. Thus, this concept can be used to treat clients with psychological problems that resulted from maladjustments by guiding them to first change their behavior and later dealing with the ""problems"".

One of the most famous therapies making use of this concept is therapy for ""heterosocial anxiety"". In this case, the assumption is that an individual perceives that he or she has poor social skills because he/she has no dates. Experiments showed that males with heterosocial anxiety perceived less anxiety with females after several sessions of therapy in which they engaged in a 12-minute, purposefully biased dyadic social interactions with a separate females. From these apparently successful interactions, the males inferred that their heterosocial anxiety was reduced. This effect is shown to be quite long-lasting as the reduction in perceived heterosocial anxiety resulted in a significantly greater number of dates among subjects 6 months later.

Marketing and persuasion

Self-perception theory is also an underlying mechanism for the effectiveness of many marketing or persuasive techniques. One typical example is the foot-in-the-door technique, which is a widely used marketing technique for persuading target customers to buy products. The basic premise of this technique is that, once a person complies with a small request (e.g. filling in a short questionnaire), he/she will be more likely to comply with a more substantial request which is related to the original request (e.g. buying the related product). The idea is that the initial commitment on the small request will change one's self-image, therefore giving reasons for agreeing with the subsequent, larger request. It is because people observe their own behaviors (paying attention to and complying with the initial request) and the context in which they behave (no obvious incentive to do so), and thus infer they must have a preference for those products.

Challenges and criticisms

Self-perception theory was initially proposed as an alternative to explain the experimental findings of the cognitive dissonance theory, and there were debates as to whether people experience attitude changes as an effort to reduce dissonance or as a result of self-perception processes. Based on the fact that the self-perception theory differs from the cognitive dissonance theory in that it does not hold that people experience a ""negative drive state"" called ""dissonance"" which they seek to relieve, the following experiment was carried out to compare the two theories under different conditions.

An early study on cognitive dissonance theory shows that people indeed experience arousal when their behavior is inconsistent with their previous attitude. Waterman designed an experiment in which 77 male college freshmen were asked to write an essay arguing against the position they actually agreed with. Then they were asked immediately to perform a simple task and a difficult task; their performance in both tasks was assessed. It was found that they performed better in the simple task and worse in the difficult task, compared to those who had just written an essay corresponding to their true attitude. As indicated by social facilitation, enhanced performance in simple tasks and worsened performance in difficult tasks shows that arousal is produced by people when their behavior is inconsistent with their attitude. Therefore, the cognitive dissonance theory is evident in this case.

Apparent disproof
Debate ensued over whether dissonance or self-perception was the valid mechanism behind attitude change. The chief difficulty lay in finding an experiment where the two flexible theories would make distinctly different predictions. Some prominent social psychologists such as Anthony Greenwald thought it would be impossible to distinguish between the two theories.

In 1974, Zanna and Cooper conducted an experiment in which individuals were made to write a counter-attitudinal essay. They were divided into either a low choice or a high choice condition. They were also given a placebo; they were told the placebo would induce either tension, relaxation, or exert no effect. Under low choice, all participants exhibited no attitude change, which would be predicted by both cognitive dissonance theory and self-perception theory. Under high choice, participants who were told the placebo would produce tension exhibited no attitude change, and participants who were told the placebo would produce relaxation demonstrated larger attitude change.

These results are not explainable by self-perception theory, as arousal should have nothing to do with the mechanism underlying attitude change. Cognitive dissonance theory, however, was readily able to explain these results: if the participants could attribute their state of unpleasant arousal to the placebo, they would not have to alter their attitude.

Thus, for a period of time, it seemed the debate between the self-perception theory and cognitive dissonance had ended.

Truce experiment
Fazio, Zanna, and Cooper conducted another experiment in 1977, demonstrating that both cognitive dissonance and self-perception could co-exist.

In an experimental design similar to Zanna and Cooper's 1974 study, another variable was manipulated: whether or not the stance of the counter-attitudinal essay fell in the latitude of acceptance or the latitude of rejection (see social judgment theory). It appeared that when the stance of the essay fell into the latitude of rejection, the results favoured cognitive dissonance. However, when the essay fell in the latitude of acceptance, the results favoured self-perception theory.

Whether cognitive dissonance or self-perception is a more useful theory is a topic of considerable controversy and a large body of literature. There are some circumstances in which a certain theory is preferred, but it is traditional to use the terminology of cognitive dissonance theory by default. The cognitive dissonance theory accounts for attitude changes when people's behaviors are inconsistent with their original attitudes which are clear and important to them; meanwhile, the self-perception theory is used when those original attitudes are relatively ambiguous and less important. Studies have shown that, in contrast to traditional belief, a large proportion of people's attitudes are weak and vague. Thus, the self-perception theory is significant in interpreting one's own attitudes, such as the assessment of one's own personality traits and whether someone would cheat to achieve a goal.

According to G. Jademyr and Yojiyfus, the perception of different aspect in the interpreting theory can be due to many factors, such as circumstances regarding dissonance and controversy. This can also be because of balance theory as it applies to the attitude towards accountability and dimensions.

"Gridded ion thruster

The gridded ion thruster is a common design for ion thrusters, a highly efficient low-thrust spacecraft propulsion running on electrical power. These designs use high-voltage grid electrodes to accelerate ions with electrostatic forces.

History
The ion engine was first demonstrated by German-born NASA  scientist Ernst Stuhlinger, and developed in practical form by Harold R. Kaufman at NASA Lewis (now Glenn) Research Center  from 1957 to the early 1960s. 

The use of ion propulsion systems were first demonstrated in space by the NASA Lewis ""Space Electric Rocket Test"" (SERT) I and II.  These thrusters used mercury as the reaction mass.  The first was SERT-1, launched July 20, 1964, which successfully proved that the technology operated as predicted in space.  The second test, SERT-II, launched on February 3, 1970, verified the operation of two mercury ion engines for thousands of running hours.  Despite the demonstration in the 1960s and 70s, though, they were rarely used before the late 1990s.

NASA Glenn continued to develop electrostatic gridded ion thrusters through the 1980s, developing the NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) engine, that was used successfully on the Deep Space 1 probe, the first mission to fly an interplanetary trajectory using electric propulsion as the primary propulsion.  It is currently flying the Dawn asteroid mission. Hughes Aircraft Company (now L-3 ETI) has developed the XIPS (Xenon Ion Propulsion System) for performing station keeping on its geosynchronous satellites (more than 100 engines flying). NASA is currently working on a 20-50 kW electrostatic ion thruster called HiPEP which will have higher efficiency, specific impulse, and a longer lifetime than NSTAR.  Aerojet has recently completed testing of a prototype NEXT ion thruster.

Beginning in the 1970s, radio-frequency ion thrusters were developed at Giessen University and ArianeGroup. RIT-10 engines are flying on the EURECA and ARTEMIS. Qinetiq (UK) has developed the T5 and T6 engines (Kaufman type), used on the GOCE mission (T5) and the BepiColombo mission (T6). From Japan, the µ10, using microwaves, flew on the Hayabusa mission.

Method of operation 
Propellant atoms are injected into the discharge chamber and are ionized by electron bombardment, forming a plasma. There are several ways of producing the energetic electrons for the discharge: electrons can be emitted from a hollow cathode and accelerated by potential difference with the anode; the electrons can be accelerated by an oscillating electric field induced by an alternating electromagnet, which results in a self-sustaining discharge and omits any cathode (radio frequency ion thruster); and microwave heating. The positively charged ions diffuse towards the chamber's extraction system (2 or 3 multi-aperture grids). After ions enter the plasma sheath at a grid hole, they are accelerated by the potential difference between the first and second grids (called the screen and accelerator grids, respectively). The ions are guided through the extraction holes by the powerful electric field. The final ion energy is determined by the potential of the plasma, which generally is slightly greater than the screen grids' voltage.

The negative voltage of the accelerator grid prevents electrons of the beam plasma outside the thruster from streaming back to the discharge plasma. This can fail due to insufficient negative potential in the grid, which is a common ending for ion thrusters' operational life. The expelled ions propel the spacecraft in the opposite direction, according to Newton's 3rd law.
Lower-energy electrons are emitted from a separate cathode, called the neutralizer, into the ion beam to ensure that equal amounts of positive and negative charge are ejected. Neutralizing is needed to prevent the spacecraft from gaining a net negative charge, which would attract ions back toward the spacecraft and cancel the thrust.

Performance 
The ion optics are constantly bombarded by a small amount of secondary ions and erode or wear away, thus reducing engine efficiency and life. Ion engines need to be able to run efficiently and continuously for years. Several techniques were used to reduce erosion; most notable was switching to a different propellant. Mercury or caesium atoms were used as propellants during tests in the 1960s and 1970s, but these propellants adhered to, and eroded the grids.  Xenon atoms, on the other hand, are far less corrosive, and became the propellant of choice for virtually all ion thruster types. NASA has demonstrated continuous operation of NSTAR engines for over 16,000 hours (1.8 years), and tests are still ongoing for double this lifetime. Electrostatic ion thrusters have also achieved a specific impulse of 30–100 kN·s/kg, better than most other ion thruster types. Electrostatic ion thrusters have accelerated ions to speeds reaching 100 km/s.

In January 2006, the European Space Agency, together with the Australian National University, announced successful testing of an improved electrostatic ion engine, the Dual-Stage 4-Grid (DS4G), that showed exhaust speeds of 210 km/s, reportedly four times higher than previously achieved, allowing for a specific impulse which is four times higher. Conventional electrostatic ion thrusters possess only two grids, one high voltage and one low voltage, which perform both the ion extraction and acceleration functions. However, when the charge differential between these grids reaches around 5 kV, some of the particles extracted from the chamber collide with the low voltage grid, eroding it and compromising the engine's longevity. This limitation is successfully bypassed when two pairs of grids are used. The first pair operates at high voltage, possessing a voltage differential of around 3 kV between them; this grid pair is responsible for extracting the charged propellant particles from the gas chamber. The second pair, operating at low voltage, provides the electrical field that accelerates the particles outwards, creating thrust. Other advantages to the new engine include a more compact design, allowing it to be scaled up to higher thrusts, and a narrower, less divergent exhaust plume of 3 degrees, which is reportedly five times narrower than previously achieved. This reduces the propellant needed to correct the orientation of the spacecraft due to small uncertainties in the thrust vector direction.

Variants 
The largest difference in the many electrostatic ion thrusters is the method of ionizing the propellant atoms - electron bombardment (NSTAR, NEXT, T5, T6), radiofrequency (rf) excitation (RIT 10, RIT 22, µN-RIT), microwave excitation (µ10, µ20). Related to this is the need for a cathode and a required effort for the power supplies. Kaufman type engines require at the least, supplies to the cathode, anode and chamber. The rf and microwave types require an additional rf generator, but no anode or cathode supplies. 

In the extraction grid systems, minor differences occur in the grid geometry and the materials used. This may have implications for the grid system operational lifetime.

"Wuhan–Yichang railway

Hankou–Yichang railway (), or Hanyi railway, is a  long high-speed railway between Hankou (a borough of Wuhan) and Yichang in Hubei province.  The railway forms a section of the Huhanrong passenger-dedicated line from Shanghai to Wuhan to Chengdu.  The Hanyi Railway was completed in spring 2012 and started commercial operations on July 1, 2012.  Adjacent high-speed rail sections, the Hefei–Wuhan high-speed railway to the east and the Yichang−Wanzhou railway to the west, opened respectively in April 2009 and December 2010.

Unlike most other high-speed railways in China which generally follow the route of pre-existing railway lines, the Hanyi railway takes a new, more direct, route between Wuhan and Yichang, bringing rail service for the first time to cities along the Yangtze River in central Hubei such as Hanchuan, Xiantao, and Qianjiang. Jingzhou, previously only served by a branch rail line to Jingmen to the north, now enjoys frequent through-train service to Wuhan and Yichang.

Construction history
According to a news item from the Wuhan City Government dated July 10, 2008, the plans for the railways were finalized at the time, and the construction was to begin shortly. According to the plans, the construction should have been completed by the end of 2011, however, this deadline was not met. A more recent schedule (confirmed in early May 2012 by Hubei provincial authorities) is for the railway to open in May 2012. It is constructed by the China Railway 12th Bureau Group Co.

On March 1 it was reported that softer earth had been used in the foundation of the railway. Later the director of Hubei railway construction office told a section of the railway had sunk more than the allowed tolerance. On 9 March 2012 it was reported that due to heavy rainfall a 300-meter section of rail collapsed in central Hubei Province.

Stations

According to the final plan, there are 8 stations on the line:
 Hankou railway station 汉口站 
 Hanchuan railway station	汉川站 	
 Tianmen South railway station			天门南站 	
 Xiantao West railway station			仙桃西站 	
 Qianjiang railway station			潜江站 	
 Jingzhou railway station				荆州站 	
 Zhijiang railway station				枝江站 	
 Yichang East railway station				宜昌东站 	

Even though Tianmen City is west of Xiantao City, Xiantao West Station (located north of Xiantao's Sanfutan Town) is located west on Tianmen South Station (located near Tianmen's Duoxiang Town). In fact, Xiantao West is the closest station to downtown Tianmen, and Tianmen South is the closest station to downtown Xiantao. This geographical oddity has resulted because of the way the border between the two county-level cities (which runs mostly along the Hanshui River) is located relative to the new railway's route.

Tianmen South Station is the station that early plans called ""Xiantao Station"".

As of 2012, the Hanyi Railway's trains have never served the Yichang railway station in downtown Yichang. In 2012, that station was closed for renovations; it is expected that after the renovation project is completed, the station will also receive EMU (i.e., D-series) trains, presumably extending the route of Wuhan-Yichang trains by one more station, much closer to downtown Yichang.

Service
As of July 2012, the Hanyi railway is primarily used by frequent high-speed D-series trains circulating between Yichang East and Wuhan's three major rail stations (Hankou, Wuchang, and Wuhan). Some of them continue to the east (to Nanjing and Shanghai Hongqiao), or to the southeast (to Nanchang, over the Wuhan–Jiujiang Railway). A few ""conventional"" (K, T, Z-series) trains use the line as well.

"Trousdale Estates

Trousdale Estates is a neighborhood of Beverly Hills, California, located in the foothills of the Santa Monica mountains. It was developed in the 1950s and 1960s and is named after Paul Trousdale, a real estate developer.

, the average sale price of a home in Trousdale Estates is over $11 million.

History
The grounds originally belonged to Mrs. Lucy Smith Doheny Battson, wife of Edward L. Doheny, Jr. (1893–1929), son of oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny (1856–1935); were known as the Doheny Ranch or the Doheny Estate; and included the Greystone Mansion, which is now a United States Historical Site. In 1954, Paul Trousdale (1915–1990) purchased the grounds, while the mansion was purchased by industrialist Henry Crown (1896–1990). Shortly after, Trousdale convinced the Beverly Hills City Council to add the neighborhood to the city, which they accepted, and he renamed it the Trousdale Estates.

Trousdale first built 532 original lots, all subject to strict regulations devised by the Architectural Committee, including how high roofs could be. Early houses were designed by renowned architects Wallace Neff (1895–1982), Paul R. Williams (1894–1980), A. Quincy Jones (1913–1979), Frank Lloyd Wright (1867–1959) and Harold Levitt (1922–2003). Allen Siple (1900–1973) acted as the supervising architect.

By 1981, some houses were remodeled, blocking their neighbors' views. As a result, after some consultation in 1987 the Trousdale Estates Homeowners Association, a non-profit organization, and the City of Beverly Hills implemented the Trousdale Ordinance to preserve the neighborhood. There are also ""view protections"" that protect a resident's view from neighboring trees, outlined in the Trousdale Ordinance.  The City of Beverly Hills now enforces these building codes and view protections.

The 410-acre neighborhood has 24/7 security patrol cars with armed guards. In addition, the Beverly Hills Police Department has increased its day and night rounds in the neighborhood with dedicated patrols. 

Loma Vista is the main thoroughfare in Trousdale Estates.

Notable residents
Celebrity residents have included Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Curtis, Ray Charles, Howard Hughes, and Groucho Marx. President Richard Nixon lived in the neighborhood. When Nixon, who had just been Vice President from 1953 to 1961 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, purchased his residence, Frank McCullogh of the Los Angeles Times reported that he had only paid $90,000 for a house whose real price was $300,000 as the developers believed his name would add prestige to the neighborhood.

More recently, Jennifer Aniston, David Spade, Zoë de Givenchy, Vera Wang, John Rich, Jane Fonda, Richard Perry, Markus Persson, Ringo Starr, Simon Cowell, and Charlie Puth have lived in the neighborhood.

Jeffery Katzenberg, who co-founded DreamWorks, bought a $35 million, 8,704-square-foot mansion in Trousdale Estates from Simon Ramo, an American physicist, engineer, and business leader.  Katzenberg hosted fundraisers for President Barack Obama at this mansion. 

In July 2019, Uber co-founder, Garrett Camp, and his wife, Eliza Nguyen, bought an 11,000 square foot mansion for $72.5 million in Trousdale Estates.

"1973 Gwent County Council election

The 1973 Gwent County Council election was held on Thursday 12 April 1973 to elect councillors to the new Gwent County Council, governing the new county of Gwent, Wales. It took place on the same day as other county council elections in the United Kingdom.

These were the first elections to the new county council, which would come into effect on 1 April 1974. Future elections would take place every four years, with the next one scheduled for April 1977. 

The 1973 election saw the Labour Party win a strong majority on the Council.

Background
Gwent was created following local government reorganisation enacted by the Local Government Act 1972. It covered the area of Monmouthshire and Newport County Borough, which would be transferred from England to Wales in 1974.

The 1973 elections were the first to the new local authorities, with councillors acting in a shadow capacity until 1 April 1974 when the new councils took full effect.

The position of alderman on the local authorities was abolished, with all members of the new councils being elected ward councillors.

Overview of the result

Seventy-eight Gwent County Council seats in 66 electoral wards were up for election in April 1973. Labour overall increased its presence in comparison with the old councils, though there were some close battles between Labour, the Liberals and Independents in some wards.

In Cwmbran Labour did not fare so well, with an Independent and a Ratepayer candidate winning seats, and the Conservatives polling strongly.

"RAAF Transport Flight (Japan)

Transport Flight (Japan) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) transport unit that operated in the aftermath of the Korean War. It was formed in March 1955 at Iwakuni, Japan, and equipped with three Douglas C-47 Dakotas and a CAC Wirraway. The flight's main duty was flying a regular courier service between Japan and South Korea in support of Commonwealth military units based on the peninsula. Transport Flight (Japan) ceased operations in June 1956 and disbanded in September that year.

History
Transport Flight (Japan) traced its lineage to a transport contingent that the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) maintained in Japan prior to the Korean War. When the war broke out in June 1950, No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron was based at Iwakuni as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Equipped primarily with North American P-51 Mustangs, the squadron also operated a communications flight of two  and two Austers. No. 91 (Composite) Wing was established at Iwakuni in October 1950 to administer all RAAF units during the war. This included No. 77 Squadron, the newly formed No. 391 (Base) Squadron and No. 491 (Maintenance) Squadron, and , formerly the No. 77 Squadron Communications Flight.  It was designated No. 30 Communications Unit in November. By then it had a complement of eight Dakotas and two Austers. No. 30 Communications Unit was redesignated No. 30 Transport Unit in November 1951. By the end of 1952, its strength was eight Dakotas and one CAC Wirraway, and fifty-nine personnel.

In March 1953, No. 30 Transport Unit re-formed as No. 36 (Transport) Squadron, which had disbanded the previous day at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. Elements of No. 36 Squadron began returning to Australia in January 1955, and by the end of the month its strength was four Dakotas and one Wirraway, and fifty-eight personnel. No. 36 Squadron ceased flying on 13 March, after which its remaining strength left Iwakuni for Australia. RAAF Transport Flight (Japan) was formed at Iwakuni the next day under the control of No. 91 Wing. The unit was equipped with three Dakotas and one Wirraway, which had been left behind when the last members of No. 36 Squadron departed for Australia. Transport Flight (Japan)'s personnel, consisting of eight officers and sixty-six other ranks by the end of month, were drawn mainly from No. 36 Squadron, including its commanding officer, Squadron Leader G.L. Waller, as well as from  No. 391 (Base) Squadron.

The flight's regular duty consisted of a courier service to Pusan and Kimpo in South Korea five days a week—Wednesdays and Sundays were excluded—to support Commonwealth forces on the peninsula. It became known in the process as ""Japan–Korea Airlines"". Generally carrying freight on the outbound journey, the aircraft often ferried casualties back to Iwakuni, and two nurses formerly of No. 391 Squadron were attached to the flight to assist with this task. The unit was also responsible for transporting VIPs. No. 391 Squadron and No. 91 Wing were disbanded at Iwakuni on 30 April 1955. Transport Flight (Japan) flew its last courier missions on 28 June 1956, and shortly after handed over its base facilities to the United States Navy. The flight's last Dakota—the last RAAF aircraft to be based in Japan—took off for Australia from Iwakuni on 8 July. It left behind some ground staff and Flight Lieutenant Raleigh, a small yellow dog that had accompanied No. 81 (Fighter) Wing—parent formation of No. 77 Squadron at the time—to Japan as its mascot in 1945 and had remained with the RAAF contingent at Iwakuni ever since. Raleigh, a keen flyer but considered too old to return to Australia, was to be given over to the care of a US service family when the last RAAF personnel departed Iwakuni. Transport Flight (Japan) was disbanded on 28 September 1956. It was reported to have carried 4,400 passengers and  of cargo between its first flight in March 1955 and its last in July 1956, including 690 Commonwealth troops in April 1956 alone, and to have only missed one scheduled service, owing to a typhoon.

"All Saints Church, Leigh

All Saints Church was built around 1250 at Leigh, north Wiltshire, England, and was originally on a site half a mile to the north of its current location.  In 1896, the nave, porch and bell tower were moved from their original location and a new church was built.  The chancel and the east gable of the old nave remain in the old churchyard as All Saints Chancel.

Moving the church, 1896
By the early 1890s, the church had fallen into significant disrepair and the path leading to it was so wet that during winter it was practically inaccessible.  The architect C.E. Ponting urged that the church should be restored and the approach improved.  However, the Archdeacon of Bristol, Hemming Robeson, reported that it was ""quite impossible to repair the church on its present site and at the same time secure its practical utility.  I myself suggested...to rebuild the nave as far as possible, stone for stone, in a more convenient position.""

This bold course was adopted.  Mr. Charles T. Stevens offered to give a site and authorisation was obtained to take down and re-erect the nave, porch and tower at a cost not to exceed 1300 pounds. This was accomplished by carefully marking each stone and each piece of timber to correspond with drawings which had been made to ensure their correct positions and transporting them by hand to be rebuilt at the current site.

The porch
The porch was built in the late fourteenth century and the original roof, the door with its handmade nails and a niche with a pedestal for a figure can all still be seen.  Also, probably a stoup for holy water.

The nave
The walls of the nave are thirteenth century but the massive wooden beams of the roof were unique to a Parish Church with a gothic character.  The principle trusses of the roof are of collar form with the moulded braces pierced with openings of quatrefoil shape.

Everywhere on the beams and bosses in the main part of the nave are carved heads and figures of Jacobean detail.

At the East end of the nave, the roof has an oak boarded and panelled ceiling which probably dates back to the fifteenth century and was re-fixed in 1638 when the whole roof was re-built.  The bosses are extremely rich and delicate in detail.

Standing beneath this ceiling and looking west down the Nave, the text that can be seen on the lower part of the bell tower reads:
Colossians Chap III, Vers 16;
Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.

The inscriptions
Moving the church to a more accessible site is commemorated by inscriptions carved on the south wood moulding:
Rebuilt here 1896 M.J. Milling Vicar.
E. Manners   R. Bolton   Ch. Wardens.
C.E. Ponting Architect.
W. Light and J. Smith  Builders.

On one of the south purlins:
I.T.   I.L.   C.W.   1783

On the collar of the east truss is carved the commemoration:
John Waldron and John Painter
Chappel Wardens 1717 and 18.   John Flux Painter.

The present roof was built in 1638 and this is recorded by a carving in the North side wood moulding:
W.T.   T.W.   H.N.   Carpenters
(with a fleur de lys between each initial)
continuing:
Blanchadin Wake: John Waldron  Church Wardens  1638.

Other features
There is an eighteenth-century pulpit and sounding board.  The windows are fourteenth and fifteenth century and in one window in the north side of the nave a fragment of the original glass can be seen.

Some of the pews near the pulpit are thought to be seventeenth century.  Near the door is the font, with its history recorded on a brass plate at the base of the stem.  The Rev. M.J. Milling discovered the font being used as a cheese press at an inn in Ashton Keynes and was told that it had previously been used as a cattle trough.  Presumably it had been removed from the church and deliberately desecrated at the time of the Parliamentary Commonwealth when infant baptism was forbidden.  In 1897, the stem was discovered forming the base of the north-east post of the tower and the whole font was restored to its proper use.  The font ewer was given in memory of D.A. Bird, G. Price, V. Ody, and R. Godwin, who gave their lives in World War II 1939-1945.

The chalice is dated 1596, in the reign of Elizabeth I, and the George I silver paten by Thomas Teasle was made in 1723.  There was also a pewter flagon and plate for bringing the wine and bread to the altar.  The flagon is inscribed ""Richard Selby and John Tucker / Chapel Wardens 1776"".

The bells
There are three bells.  The largest is inscribed ""Henry Neale Made Mee: 1627 GH:ESQVYER:EH:"".

The middle bell is inscribed ""Ave Maria: Gracia Plena"" and although no date is inscribed it is thought to have been made in Bristol about 1450.

The third bell is inscribed ""John Parker & John Waldron Ch. Wardens A R 1729"".

The chancel

All Saints Chancel (the original church) is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.  It was declared redundant on 1 February 1977, and was vested in the Trust on 24 October 1978.

The chancel is entered through a finely moulded thirteenth century doorway which has a hood-mould resting on a human head and a beast's head.  Inside, on the South wall there is a late thirteenth century window having three stepped lancet lights under one arch.  On the wall of the chancel are 17th-century texts painted on the walls and framed in designs of clouds and scrolls.  The inside sill is carried down a sedilia and in the east jamb there is a piscina for washing communion vessels.

In 1983 the texts were re-lettered in their original style and we can see the similarity to the decoration of the Colossians text in the Church.

"Dejan Stojanović

Dejan Stojanović (, ; born 11 March 1959) is a Serbian poet, writer, essayist,   philosopher, businessman, and former journalist. His poetry is characterized by a recognizable system of thought and poetic devices, bordering on philosophy, and, overall, it has a highly reflective tone. According to the critic Petar V. Arbutina, ""Stojanović belongs to the small and autochthonous circle of poets who have been the main creative and artistic force of the Serbian poetry in the last several decades.""

Early life 
Dejan Stojanović was born on 11 March 1959 in Peć, Autonomous District of Kosovo and Metohija, PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. In 1972, he moved with his family to Sutomore, near Bar, Montenegro, where he completed his secondary education. He attended the University of Pristina at Kosovo. While he was predominantly interested in philosophy and the arts during his youth, he earned a degree in law.

Writing background

Poetry
He began to write poetry in the late seventies and kept his work private for three to four years, after which he published his poems in literary magazines in the former Yugoslavia. Serbian magazines in which his work was published include Stremljenja (English translation: Trends) and Jedinstvo (English translation: Unity)  in Priština, and Gradina  in Niš. By 1983, he became a member of a literary club (Karagač) in his hometown of Peć. During this time, he was named as the secretary and later promoted to president of the club. In this role, he conducted interviews with some local artists from Kosovo.

In his early adulthood, Stojanović developed a philosophical system of ideas that dealt primarily with metaphysical questions and the structure of the Universe. He wrote several hundred pages in his notebooks exploring these ideas, along with essays on language and literature. In 1999, these manuscripts, along with his library of more than a thousand books (carefully chosen for years), were lost due to fire shortly after the war in Kosovo ended. His books, along with his manuscripts, were held temporarily in his brother's office in the center of downtown Peć.

Publishing 
In 1990, Stojanović established a private publishing firm known as Metoh (English translation: the church's land). While the organization was located in Peć, the firm planned to publish a literary magazine in Kosovo. The firm's staff included writers from Belgrade, one of whom was Alek Vukadinović, a Serbian poet who supported Stojanović's plan to publish a magazine. While Stojanović's first book of poetry, Krugovanje (English translation: Circling) was ready for publication in 1983, it was not published until 1993. During those ten years, several poems that were initially planned for inclusion in the book had been replaced by newer poems, which had been written between 1983 and 1986. The last poem in the book had actually been written in Chicago, in 1991.

Journalism 

In early 1990, Stojanović joined the writing staff of Serbian magazine, Pogledi (English translation: Viewpoints). At this time, he began a series of interviews with several Serbian writers in Belgrade, including Momo Kapor, Alek Vukadinović, and Nikola Milošević. During his second visit to Paris in May and June 1990, he interviewed Ljuba Popović, Petar Omčikus, Miloš Šobajić, and Jacques Claude Villard. In December 1990, he went to the US as a foreign correspondent, planning to stay six months to a year. During this time, he conducted interviews with prominent American writers, including Nobel Laureate Saul Bellow, Charles Simic, and Steve Tesich. He did not return to his homeland in summer 1991, when the Yugoslav Wars started in the former Yugoslavia, and has been living in Chicago since 1990. In honor of his series of interviews published in Conversations, published in 1999 by Književna reč of Belgrade, Stojanović received the Rastko Petrović Award, presented by the Association of Writers of Serbia.

Style 

Stojanović’s poetry collections are characterized by sequences of compact, dense poems, simple yet complex in carefully organized overall structure, and that is why some more visibly than others appear as long poems. This is especially characteristic of the books, The Sign and its Children, The Shape, and The Creator (Znak I njegova deca, Oblik,  Tvoritelj ), in which, with a relatively small number of words repeated in different contexts, Stojanović built his own poetic cosmogony. For that reason, writer and critic, David Kecman, described him as a cosmosophist.

In his poems, he covers the smallest and the largest topics with equal attention, often juxtaposing them to the level of paradox and absurdity, gradually building new perspectives and meanings that are not only poetic either in origin or in purpose. Some themes and preoccupations, be they stones or galaxies, are present in all of his books and it can be said that his poetry books are, in themselves, long poems and that all of them serve as ingredients of a hyper-poetry book that is still in the making.

He used many poetic forms never used before in Serbian poetry and also created some new forms. ""If elegance is represented by simplicity, then these are some of the most elegant verses imaginable,"" Branko Mikasinovich stated.

Published works 
The majority of Stojanović's poems, initially written in Serbian and compiled into six volumes of poetry, have been translated into English  and a selection of his poems has been translated into French.

"Milbenkäse

Milbenkäse (""mite cheese""), called Mellnkase in the local dialect and often known (erroneously) as Spinnenkäse (""spider cheese""), is a German speciality cheese. It is made by flavouring balls of quark (a type of soft cheese) with caraway and salt, allowing them to dry, and then leaving them in a wooden box containing rye flour and cheese mites for about three months. An enzyme in the digestive juices excreted by the mites causes the cheese to ripen. 

Milbenkäse is said to taste similar to Harzer cheese, but with a bitter note (increasing with age) and a distinctive zesty aftertaste. Mites clinging to the cheese rind are consumed along with the cheese.

Historically, the cheese was produced in the Zeitz and Altenburg districts of the Saxony-Anhalt / Thuringia border region; today it is produced exclusively in the village of Würchwitz, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.

The traditional method of making Milbenkäse, which dates back to the Middle Ages, was nearly lost by 1970, with only the elderly Liesbeth Brauer knowing the technique. Local science teacher Helmut Pöschel was taught the proper way to make it and together with his associate, Christian Schmelzer, succeeded in revitalizing the tradition. A Cheese Mite Memorial was later erected at Würchwitz to celebrate the renaissance of Milbenkäse production.

Production

Quark flavoured with salt and caraway is shaped into small balls, cylinders or wheels, and dried. Then it is placed in a wooden box containing rye flour and  inhabited by Tyrophagus casei mites for at least three months. The digestive juices of the mites diffuse into the cheese and cause fermentation; the flour is added because the mites would otherwise simply eat the whole cheese instead of just nibbling away at the crust as is desired. After one month, the cheese rind turns yellow; after three months, reddish brown. Some producers allow the cheese to ripen for up to one year, until it has turned black.

Legality
Milbenkäse falls into something of a legal grey area: EU Regulation 178/2002 allows the sale of foodstuffs containing living animals if they are ""prepared for placing on the market for human consumption"". On the other hand, cheese mites or their digestive juices are not explicitly permitted as additives for cheese according to the relevant German food ordinances (Zusatzstoff-Zulassungsverordnung and Käseverordnung). Milbenkäse is produced under a permit by the local food safety office and HACCP compliance of the product is enforced.

Similar cheeses
Cheese mites are used in cheese maturing elsewhere. The most famous example is probably Mimolette from northeastern France and nearby Belgium. Other French cheeses - mainly from the Massif Central, the French Alps and the Pyrenees - sometimes host cheese mites in their crust more (e.g. old Cantal and Salers) or less (e.g. certain Tomme de Montagne varieties) by accident. But most of these cheeses are semi-hard to hard rennet cheeses, whereas Milbenkäse is a softer sour milk cheese. 

The Spanish Cabrales cheese of the Asturias region also contains living cheese mites, though they are few in number, inhabit the mould canals, and take no significant part in the maturation of this blue cheese. 

Another cheese that contains living animals is casu marzu, which contains maggots of the cheese fly.

"Armou

Armou () is a village in the Paphos District of Cyprus, located  south-east of Mesogi. It has a panoramic view of Paphos. Armou is located 363m above sea level. The area has been inhabited since pre-Christian times, according to the findings now exhibited at the Archaeological Museum of Paphos. The name of the community emerged from its first settler called Armos, while another version speaks of the “armos (joint in Greek)“ because of its location (like a joint joining the mountain and the valley). A third version refers to the “arma (chariot in Greek)” of the goddess Aphrodite, which the goddess used in order to visit these places.  Due to the village's location and environment, the village has attracted many Cypriot and foreign residents.

Transportation 
The Tsada Golf Course – Minthis Hills is a 7 km drive from Armou. The Agia Varvara church is the only church in the village.

"James Davison (California politician)

James Davison (1827 – December 21, 1897) was the seventh President of the Chico Board of Trustees, the governing body of Chico, California from 1886 to 1888.

Early life and family
James Davison was born in Derry, Ireland in 1827. He came to America at the age of three years, with his father, who worked as a weaver in New Jersey. The family returned to Ireland due to his father's health, as well as the failure of a business in New York to which his father had been in consignment. He was thirteen at the time.

Aged 19, in 1846, James returned to America. He enlisted in Company G of the 2nd Ohio Infantry. He served under General Winfield Scott, in the Mexican–American War. After the war, the discovery of gold had become known, and he set out for California.

Life in California
Upon arrival, Davison engaged in mining for several years. He first mined near Nevada City and afterward on the Trinity River. A day's work gave him as much as $100, and over three years he saved $6,000.

After quitting the mines, he engaged in the drug business at Weaverville, with his brother. There, he was also post office clerk under the administration of President James Buchanan. In 1857 he moved to Rabbit Creek (now La Porte), and opened a drug store. He was in business until the outbreak of the American Civil War.

In 1857, Davison married Agnes M. Waldron, a native of Pennsylvania; the couple had five children.

In 1861, Davison enlisted in Company D, 4th California Volunteer Infantry. He was appointed Second Lieutenant, Assistant Quartermaster and Assistant Commissary, and was Commander of the Post at Fort YamHill, Oregon. After this he was promoted to First Lieutenant, Company C, same regiment, serving in Arizona, from where he and his company were sent to Camp Cady, until the close of the war. Having received his discharge he returned to San Francisco and worked in publishing the New Age, which he continued one year. Then he became a teacher for six months. From there he went to Colusa County and took possession of 160 acres of government land. In 1870 he came to Butte County.

He was elected to the office of City Trustee of Chico and served three years, being president of the board two years of that time. In 1890, he was Justice of the Peace.

Doomed to Die is a 1940 American mystery film directed by William Nigh and starring Boris Karloff as Mr. Wong. It is a sequel to the 1940 film, The Fatal Hour.

Plot

When the head of a shipping company is murdered in his office the identity of the killer seems obvious. The killer is the son of the owner of a rival shipping company; the reason is the Romeo and Juliet romance between the killer and the murdered man's daughter. They wanted to get married. The murdered man refused to give them his permission.

The murdered man's daughter asks Mr. Wong to investigate. She hopes that Wong will be able to prove that her fiancé didn't kill her father.

The killing took place a few days after the Wentworth Castle, one of the company's liners, caught fire and sank with the loss of more than 400 lives. Once again, Wong is given important information by the leader of a powerful tong (Chinese secret society) that leads him to other suspects. The tong leader tells Wong that a member of the tong was smuggling a great amount of tong money into the United States aboard the Wentworth Castle. The smuggler is known to have survived the sinking but disappeared with the tong's money.

Wong uses modern (for 1940) technology to recover seemingly ""lost"" evidence. He uncovers multiple conspiracies within the shipping company and succeeds in proving that the fiancé is not the murderer.

"Ian Watson (author)

Ian Watson (born 20 April 1943) is a British science fiction writer. He lives in Gijón, Spain.

Life
In 1959 Watson worked as an accounts clerk at Runciman's, a Newcastle shipping company. The experience was not particularly satisfying.

Watson graduated in English Literature from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1963; in 1965 he earned a research degree in English and French 19th-century literature.

Watson lectured English in Tanzania (1965–67) and Tokyo (1967–70), and taught Future Studies at the Birmingham Polytechnic from 1970 to 1976. After 1976 he devoted himself to his career as a professional writer.

His first novel, The Embedding, winner of the Prix Apollo in 1975, is unusual for being based on ideas from generative grammar; the title refers to the process of center embedding.  A prolific writer, he has also written the novels Miracle Visitors, God's World, The Jonah Kit and The Flies of Memory and many collections of short stories. Watson is credited as author of the screen story for the motion picture A.I. Artificial Intelligence. In 1977, The Jonah Kit won the BSFA Award for Best Novel.

During 1980, Watson and Michael Bishop wrote the first transatlantic SF novel collaboration, Under Heaven's Bridge, using typewriters and postal services.

He has also written a series of novels relating to the Warhammer 40,000 line of games: Space Marine, and the Inquisition War trilogy of Inquisitor, Harlequin and Chaos Child (republished in 2002 by The Black Library, with Inquisitor retitled Draco). Other recent stories have been published in US magazine Weird Tales, the Canadian anthology Lust For Life, New Writings in the Fantastic, the Mammoth Book of Best New Erotica volume 7, and in a few more books. Some of these stories have been translated into non-English languages.

A collaboration with Italian surrealist writer Roberto Quaglia has produced a book, The Beloved of My Beloved, launched during April 2009 during Eastercon.

His major work of recent years is The Waters of Destiny co-written with Andy West.

"Gabriel Newton

Gabriel Newton (1683–1762) was a leading figure in the English city of Leicester.  

Born in Leicester, he was a wool-comber by trade and later became landlord of the Horse and Trumpet Inn.  In 1710 he was appointed as a member of the city's Corporation, in 1726 was chosen as an alderman, and in 1732 was elected as Mayor of Leicester. He was married three times, and each of his wives was a woman of considerable wealth, and thus he himself became rich.  After the death of his only son, Newton had no descendants, so he left his fortune to aid the education of the poor, establishing a charity school in Leicester at the Church of St Mary de Castro, which was opened in 1785 after legal problems with his will. It was known as the Greencoat School from the uniform worn by the pupils. His school later became Alderman Newton's School and survived until 1999 when it was merged by the local authority with two other local schools to form a single educational institution.

Newton is one of the four men portrayed on Leicester's Haymarket Memorial Clock Tower.
He is buried in the graveyard of All Saints Church, Leicester on Highcross Street where his memorial tomb can be seen.

"Transportation in San Diego

Transportation in San Diego consists of a variety of air, road, sea, and public transportation options.

Public transportation

San Diego is served by the trolley, bus, Coaster, and Amtrak. The trolley primarily serves downtown and surrounding urban communities, Mission Valley, east county, the coastal south bay, and the international border. A planned Mid-Coast line will operate from Old Town to University City along the 5 Freeway. There are also plans for a Silver Line to expand trolley service downtown.  A historical timeline of the development of public transportation in San Diego (dating back to 1886) is available on the Metropolitan Transit System's website

The Amtrak and Coaster trains currently run along the coastline and connect San Diego with Los Angeles,
Orange County, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Ventura via Metrolink. There are two Amtrak stations in San Diego, in Old Town and Downtown.

The bus is available along almost all major routes; however, a large number of bus stops are concentrated in central San Diego. Typical wait times vary from 15 to 60 minutes, depending on the location and route . Trolleys arrive at each station every 7 to 30 minutes (depending on time of day and which trolley line is used). Ferries are also available every half hour crossing San Diego Bay to Coronado.

Public Transportation Statistics
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in San Diego, CA, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 70 min. 23% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 16 min, while 29.% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 11.2 km, while 30% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.

Cycling
The dry and mild climate of San Diego makes cycling a convenient and pleasant year-round option.   The city has some segregated cycle facilities, particularly in newer developments, however the majority of road facilities specifically for bicycles are painted on regular roadways.  The city's hilly, canyoned terrain and long average trip distances—brought about by strict low-density zoning laws—somewhat restrict cycling for utilitarian purposes.  In 2014 of .9% of commuters traveled by bicycle, below the average 1% for large U.S. cities.  Also in 2014, San Diego experienced 6.8 bicyclist fatalities per 10,000 cyclist commuters, the average for all large cities was 4.7.

A bicycle sharing system called Decobike was instituted in 2015.

Air
San Diego has two major international airports entirely or extending into its city limits:

San Diego International Airport, also known as Lindbergh Field, is the primary commercial airport serving San Diego. It is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States, and is the third busiest single-runway airport in the world, only behind London Gatwick and Mumbai. It serves over 24 million passengers every year, and is located on San Diego Bay three miles (4.8 km) from downtown. There are scheduled flights to the rest of the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico, United Kingdom, Germany, and Switzerland. It serves as a focus city for Southwest Airlines and Alaska Airlines. Voters rejected a proposal to move the airport to Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in November 2006.

Since December 9, 2015, the Cross Border Xpress terminal in Otay Mesa has given direct access to Tijuana International Airport, with passengers walking across the U.S.–Mexico border on a footbridge to catch their flight on the Mexican side. It is the only airport in the world with terminals located on the territory of two countries.

Other airports include Brown Field Municipal Airport (Brown Field) and Montgomery Field.

Sea
The Port of San Diego manages the maritime operations of San Diego harbor. Cruise ships arrive and depart from San Diego's cruise ship terminal on B Street Pier. Carnival Cruise Lines and Holland America have home port cruise ships in San Diego during the winter season. A second cruise terminal on Broadway Pier opened in 2010.

San Diego is home to General Dynamics' National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO), the largest shipyard on the West Coast of the United States. It is capable of building and repairing large ocean-going vessels. The yard constructs commercial cargo ships and auxiliary vessels for the U.S. Navy and Military Sealift Command, which it has served since 1960.

Roads

The streets and highways of San Diego reflect the auto-oriented development of the city as well as its ""urban sprawl"" historic growth pattern. Major freeways were built and repeatedly expanded to serve the needs of commuters coming into the city from the suburban regions of North County, South Bay, and East County, as well as the Tijuana metropolitan area. The importance of tourism to the city also stimulated the development of roads, since 70% of tourists visiting San Diego arrive by car.

Major highways

Interstates
San Diego is the terminus of three primary interstate highways. The region is also served by one three-digit auxiliary interstate.

California State Routes
State highways in San Diego include the following:

.

Major streets
 Rosecrans Street (formerly California State Route 209)
 Balboa Avenue (formerly California State Route 274)
 El Cajon Boulevard (Interstate 8 business loop, formerly part of U.S. Route 80)

"Theodore Pitcairn

Theodore Pitcairn (November 5, 1893 – December 17, 1973) the son of PPG Industries founder John Pitcairn, was a clergyman, theologian, philanthropist, and connoisseur of the arts and antiquities.

Early life and education 

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 5, 1893, he was the fourth son and fifth child of John and Gertrude Pitcairn.The family moved from Philadelphia to their newly built home, Cairnwood, in Huntingdon Valley in 1895. Pitcairn spent his early school years in the Bryn Athyn parish schools of the General Church of the New Jerusalem, which follows the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. He received his high school diploma from the Academy of the New Church Boys College in 1913. After attending the University of Pennsylvania, Pitcairn made the decision to study at the Academy of the New Church Theological School. He graduated in June, 1918, with a Bachelor of Theology degree.

Early career 
Ordained into the priesthood of the General Church in 1917, Pitcairn worked with the church missions and taught theology to African students in South Africa and Lesotho (then known as Basutoland). He served as Pastor of the Durban Society in Natal, South Africa, and later as Assistant Pastor of the Bryn Athyn Church. During this time, he also served as Acting Pastor of the Circle at Seine-et-Marne, France. Pitcairn taught art history, history of education, and a course on the ""Human Organic"" at the Academy College.

Establishment of a new church 

In the late 1930s, doctrinal differences within the General Church led Pitcairn and several other church members to found a new branch of the New Church known as The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma. In 1939, Pitcairn established a non-profit corporation for the purposes of promoting and maintaining the new church. He served as pastor of the Philadelphia Society of The Lord's New Church until 1960, when leadership of the church passed to Philip N. Odhner.

Author 

Pitcairn wrote several doctrinal works, including The Book Sealed with Seven Seals (1927); The Seven Days of Creation (1930); and My Lord and My God: Essays on Modern Religion, the Bible and Emanuel Swedenborg (1967). In 1969 the church published The Beginning and Development of Doctrine in the New Church by Theodore Pitcairn, bound together with Notes on the Development of Doctrine in the Church by Philip N. Odhner.

Art collector 

Over the years, Pitcairn traveled extensively in Europe, where he further developed his keen interest in fine art. He acquired paintings by El Greco, Claude Monet, Rembrandt, and Vincent van Gogh. Thomas Hoving, former Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, described meeting the Reverend Pitcairn in the course of negotiating the purchase of Garden at Sainte-Adresse by Claude Monet. While searching for a suitable portrait painter for church dignitaries—Bishop William Frederic Pendleton and Bishop Nathaniel Dandridge Pendleton—Pitcairn met the young artist, through the efforts of Ernst Pfeiffer, in 1921 at the home of the banker and art collector Nicolaas Urban. Impressed by Smit's style, Pitcairn purchased Marijke with White Feather Fan, a portrait of Urban's daughter. He subsequently met Maryke, the subject of the painting, and they were married in 1926. Theodore and Maryke (September 7, 1905 - November 10, 1978) were the parents of nine children. Maryke's mother, Berendina, married Philippe Smit in 1941 after her divorce from Nicolaas Urban (1929). Throughout the painter’s life until his death in 1948 and even after that, Pitcairn acquired the majority of the artist’s works.

Patron of the arts 
Pitcairn's love of antiquities is evident in the art studio he built for Smit on the grounds of his estate in Bryn Athyn. Designed by famed Philadelphia architect George Howe, of Mellor Meigs & Howe, the building incorporates 12th century French stone columns and an Italian stone-carved fireplace. The heavy wooden doors are embellished with ironwork by the metalworker, Samuel Yellin. The studio now serves as the  Chapel of The Lord's New Church. Many of Smit's paintings were hung in the chapel and in the Pitcairns' colonial-era home in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania.

Pitcairn was a major benefactor of the Philadelphia Orchestra during the time Eugene Ormandy served as conductor [citation needed].

Death 

Pitcairn died at his home in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania on December 17, 1973. His wife, Maryke, died five years later, in 1978.

"Delano Municipal Airport

Delano Municipal Airport  is two miles southeast of Delano, in Kern County, California.

Most U.S. airports use the same three-letter location identifier for the FAA and IATA, but Delano Municipal Airport is DLO to the FAA and has no IATA code.

Facilities
Delano Municipal Airport covers  and has one asphalt runway (14/32) measuring .

In the year ending January 23, 2006 the airport had 19,000 aircraft operations, average 52 per day, all general aviation. 44 aircraft are based at this airport: 68% single engine, 5% multi-engine and 27% helicopters.

History
Delano Airport opened in April 1940. It was built by the federal government with monies appropriated by Congress for Development of Landing Areas for National Defense (DLAND). It was built by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA).

In late 1943 the United States Army Air Forces acquired usage rights to the airport. It was placed under the jurisdiction of the  IV Fighter Command. The 481st Night Fighter Operational Training Group (NFOTG) used the facility, named Delano Army Airfield as part of the Army Air Forces Night Fighter School which had transferred from Florida to Hammer Field, California. Delano was used as an auxiliary training airfield and the school operated a combination of modified Douglas A-20 Havocs for night fighter operations, designated P-70, and new prototype YP-61 Black Widow purpose-built night fighters

Between 31 March and 15 June 1944, the 426th Night Fighter Squadron trained at Delano; the 548th Night Fighter Squadron between June and September 1944. In addition, flights of P-61s from the 427th, 547th, 549th and 550th Night Fighter Squadrons moved in and out of Delano AAF during 1944 as part of their training prior to being deployed to combat units, primarily in the Pacific and CBI theaters.

In December 1944, the 481st NFOTG was inactivated as part of an AAF reorganization. Delano Field was transferred over to the jurisdiction of Air Technical Service Command on 10 December. It was placed on standby status and the airport was only used for emergency, being under the control of Hammer Field.

With the end of the war, the base was declared excess to requirements and returned to civil control.

Delano has had almost no scheduled airline flights, but did appear in the OAG circa 1969.

"Euglenozoa

The euglenozoa are a large group of flagellate Excavata. They include a variety of common free-living species, as well as a few important parasites, some of which infect humans. There are two main subgroups, the euglenids and kinetoplastids. Euglenozoa are unicellular, mostly around  in size, although some euglenids get up to  long.

Structure
Most euglenozoa have two flagella, which are inserted parallel to one another in an apical or subapical pocket. In some these are associated with a cytostome or mouth, used to ingest bacteria or other small organisms. This is supported by one of three sets of microtubules that arise from the flagellar bases; the other two support the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cell.

Some other euglenozoa feed through absorption, and many euglenids possess chloroplasts, the only eukaryotes outside Diaphoretickes to do so without performing kleptoplasty, and so obtain energy through photosynthesis. These chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and contain chlorophylls A and B, along with other pigments, so are probably derived from a captured green alga.  Reproduction occurs exclusively through cell division.  During mitosis, the nuclear membrane remains intact, and the spindle microtubules form inside of it.

The group is characterized by the ultrastructure of the flagella.  In addition to the normal supporting microtubules or axoneme, each contains a rod (called paraxonemal), which has a tubular structure in one flagellum and a latticed structure in the other.  Based on this, two smaller groups have been included here: the diplonemids and Postgaardi.

Classification
The euglenozoa are generally accepted as monophyletic. They are related to Percolozoa; the two share mitochondria with disk-shaped cristae, which only occurs in a few other groups.
Both probably belong to a larger group of eukaryotes called the Excavata. This grouping, though, has been challenged.

"USS Brisk (PG-89)

HMS Flax, a modified , was laid down on 28 February 1942 at Kingston, Ontario, Canada, by War Supplies Ltd., for the Royal Navy. Launched on 15 June 1942 it was reallocated to the United States under the so-called ""Reverse Lend-Lease"" program and renamed and redesignated Brisk (PG-89) on 14 August 1942. Completed on 5 December 1942, the ship was commissioned on 6 December 1942, Lt. Norman B. Denel, USNR, in command.

Service history
She departed Kingston on 7 December bound for Montreal and reached that city on the 10th. Four days later, she sailed for Quebec, arriving on the 16th. There, the remaining work to complete the ship for service was carried out. On 8 January 1943, Brisk headed for Boston in company with  by way of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Upon her arrival at the Boston Navy Yard, Brisk underwent repairs and alterations. Once this work was completed, the gunboat commenced her shakedown on 26 February. Then, after three days of anti-submarine warfare training out of New London, she reached New York City on 10 March.

Soon thereafter, Brisk commenced escorting convoys between New York and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a prosaic but highly important duty that kept her employed through V-E Day in the spring of 1945.  Brisk saw action on August 1st 1943 while escorting Convoy NG-376 30 miles west of Great Inagua.  She drove down U-boat U-732 that was lying in wait for the convoy, allowing it to pass unmolested.   Upon the conclusion of her last convoy mission, with GN-204 (Guantanamo to New York) — which reached New York on 15 May 1945 — Brisk sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, on 11 June. She continued south from there on 23 June and arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, two days later.

Brisk served at Charleston into the autumn of 1945. She was decommissioned there on 9 October 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 24 October 1945. Transferred to the War Shipping Administration on 18 October 1946 for disposal, she was operated in mercantile service into the mid-1950s, initially retaining her name Brisk. Later, however, she was documented under the names Ariana (1951) and Arvida Bay (1955).

Made in USA is a 2005 sculpture by American artist Michael Davis, installed at the SODO light rail station in Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington. It consists of a  by  steel archway as well as a plaza with seating areas. The archway is composed of oversized tools, including a try square, spirit level, and carpenter pencil. The seating area includes benches shaped into I-beams and a cog, with cast bronze replicas of workbench tools soldered onto the granite tops. Both elements honor the industrial legacy of Seattle's SoDo neighborhood by using ""tools of the trade"".

The archway element of the piece was installed in August 2005 as the first piece of public art on the Central Link line.

"Dunrobin, Ontario

Dunrobin is a community in West Carleton-March Ward in the City of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located about 35 kilometres northwest of Downtown Ottawa. Dunrobin lies within a valley, nestled between the Ottawa River and the Carp escarpment, and is located at 45.18° latitude and 75.55° longitude. Dunrobin is located on the former boundary between West Carleton Township and Kanata (formerly March Township). Dunrobin was amalgamated with the city of Ottawa in 2000. Dunrobin is expanding steadily with a current population of about 1,000 people.

The Dunrobin Community Association defines the community boundaries as Murphy Sideroad, Constance Lake Road and Berry Sideroad on the south, the Ottawa River to the east, a line following Limestone Road to Kinburn Sideroad to Stonecrest Road to Thomas A. Dolan Parkway to Marchhurst Road, and on the north by a line following Kilmaurs Sideroad to Woodkilton Road to Kinburn Sideroad to Constance Creek on the north.

Dunrobin was settled in the 19th century at the corner of Dunrobin Road and Thomas A. Dolan Parkway. The town centre comprises a community centre with outdoor recreation facilities and a number of small businesses. While originally started as an agricultural community it now serves mostly as a focal point within a larger community that has a mixed population of farmers, commuters who work in Kanata and Ottawa-Gatineau, cottagers and pensioners. Some nearby points of interest include Fitzroy Provincial Park, Constance Bay and the Diefenbunker museum. 

Dunrobin took its name from Dunrobin Castle near Inverness, Scotland.

On September 21, 2018, a high-end EF3 tornado struck the community, damaging or destroying 60 buildings and seriously injuring three people.

"Hipódromo Camarero

Hipódromo Camarero, formerly known as El Nuevo Comandante, is a horse racing building located in Canóvanas, Puerto Rico, to the east of San Juan and Carolina. It is about a fifteen-minute drive from Carolina's Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport, and 25 minutes east from the Isla Verde hotel area. The new administration of Camarero Race Track Corporation start operations on January 5, 2007.

El Nuevo Comandante was built in 1976,and opened on October 31, 1976, to substitute the original ""El Comandante"" building, which had been located in Carolina, from January 1957 to mid October 1976. It has become arguably the most important horse racing complex in the island, holding horse races every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

El Nuevo Comandante features a betting window, in which players can try their luck at different games, such as ""El Pool Pote"" and others. The top award a player can win at El Nuevo Comandante is the ""Pool Pote"" (Pool Pot) and it reached a staggering 12 Million dollars and has been the largest pot ever won in Puerto Rico's Horse Racing Industry. In addition to the betting windows at El Nuevo Comandante, the Industry has a link of betting agencies throughout Puerto Rico. These are called ""agencias hipicas"", and people can go there to place bets as well and enjoy local refreshments and snacks.

Races at ""El Nuevo Comandante"" have been shown on local television and Les Oraliens  on radio since the building was inaugurated. Some of the most famous television sportscasters in Puerto Rican history have commented from there, including Norman H. Davila and Manolo Rivera Morales.

Some famous jockeys have run there too, including Hall of Famer Angel Cordero, John Velazquez and J.C. Diaz.

Famous horses imported to run at El Nuevo Comandante have been: Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Bold Forbes, Santa Anita Derby winner Mister Frisky, Bandit Bomber and Dawn Glory (Stakes winner in USA).

Among the native horses: Hurly Road (Triple Crown winner), Ribot's Verset (one of the best sires in Puerto Rican history), My favorite Place (Multiple allowance winner in California) Capa Prieto (undefeated for years), Camarero (Holds a record of 56 consecutive wins in a row), Vuelve Candy B (Triple Crown and Caribbean Derby winner and the only horse to earn a million dollars in Puerto Rico), Verset Dancer (Caribbean Derby winner and winner in USA) and Verset's Jet (son of Verset Dancer) who's the first horse to complete the Caribbean Derby and Confraternidad Stakes double. 

El Nuevo Comandante also has the infamous distinction (Guinness record) of having the horse with the most consecutive losses (Dona Chepa) with 134 consecutive loses (through 11/2/08 without a win)

El Nuevo Comandante is also the site where the most famous race in the Caribbean has been held for 32 years: The Clasico del Caribe is celebrated there yearly, with horses participating from Colombia, Venezuela, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Puerto Rico, among other countries.

"Noel Comia Jr.

Noel M. Comia Jr. (born May 29, 2004) is a Filipino actor, commercial model, singer, TV events host, and voice talent who won Cinemalaya's Best Actor Award 2017 for movie Kiko Boksingero (the youngest of which to do so) and joined as a contestant in the third season of The Voice Kids under Team Lea with his coach Lea Salonga. Prior to his appearance on The Voice Kids, this multi-talented child actor has appeared in numerous theater productions and TV commercials.

He is dubbed as the 'wonderboy' as he is excellent not just in the field of performing arts, but in the field of music as well, as he can play several musical instruments.

Personal life 
Noel Comia Jr. is born to Filipino businessman and TV/Commercial/Movie Talent, Noel C. Comia and employee, Elisa M. Comia.

At the humble age of 6, his parents took notice of his musical talents as he belted out songs on their karaoke machine, and playing harmonies on several musical instruments. His parents then decided to take him to music and theater acting workshops to further develop his talent for music and acting.

In 2011, at the age of 6, Noel Jr attended his very first musical theater class in 'Kids Acts Philippines' (KAPI) TheCampArt Performing School, which is a professional children's theater company in the Philippines. There, he was trained as a scholar and has been a student and actor of the theater company ever since.

Career

"List of Central American folk music traditions

This is a list of folk music traditions, with styles, dances, instruments and other related topics.  The term folk music can not be easily defined in a precise manner; it is used with widely varying definitions depending on the author, intended audience and context within a work.  Similarly, the term traditions in this context does not connote any strictly-defined criteria.  Music scholars, journalists, audiences, record industry individuals, politicians, nationalists and demagogues may often have occasion to address which fields of folk music are distinct traditions based along racial, geographic, linguistic, religious, tribal or ethnic lines, and all such peoples will likely use different criteria to decide what constitutes a ""folk music tradition"".  This list uses the same general categories used by mainstream, primarily English-language, scholarly sources, as determined by relevant statements of fact and the internal structure of works.

These traditions may coincide entirely, partially or not at all with geographic, political, linguistic or cultural boundaries.  Very few, if any, music scholars would claim that there are any folk music traditions that can be considered specific to a distinct group of people and with characteristics undiluted by contact with the music of other peoples; thus, the folk music traditions described herein overlap in varying degrees with each other.

"Association of Pension Lawyers

The Association of Pension Lawyers (APL) is a group of more than 1,100 lawyers who practise pension law in the UK. It is a non-profit making organisation and has no connection with the Law Society. Founded in 1984, it represents a forum by which lawyers in different firms and barristers' chambers can exchange knowledge and opinions on pension law and developments. The APL represents an unusually successful example of co-operation between rival lawyers, and the Employment Lawyers Association (ELA) was modelled on it. Its current chairman is Hywel Robinson and its current secretary is Isobel Carruthers.

It has a strong educational element, with an annual conference, frequent seminars and training conferences for more junior pension lawyers. The APL makes technical (but not political) representations on proposed legislative and regulatory changes. It also offers substantial social networking opportunities between pension lawyers, who as a result are more familiar with each other than is customary in other legal disciplines in the UK. Almost all practising pension lawyers subscribe to APL membership, given the practical benefits of membership.

"Colchester County High School

Colchester County High School for Girls is a selective girls' grammar school with academy status in Colchester, Essex. The school consistently scores highly in the league tables for the UK. It was joint first in the country in the 2018 secondary GCSE league tables, and ninth in the country in the 2015 A-Level league tables. Entrance to Year 7 is by an academic selection test, the Eleven Plus. Entrance into Year 12 is by GCSE grades, although priority is given to pre-existing pupils.

History 
The school was originally located in the Albert Hall in the High Street (now the Co-operative Bank), until its intended premises at the top of North Hill (now the Sixth Form College) were completed. Later, the lower school moved to Greyfriars on East Hill and, in 1957, moved to new buildings in Norman Way, off Lexden Road. Most of the buildings are unchanged, but an extension, including new Science laboratories and Sixth Form facilities was added in 2002. The 'mSchool' was added between 2006 and 2009, with new facilities for Music, Mathematics and the Mind; its 'iLab' (innovation laboratory) is one of the few in the UK outside a University.

Currently, the school is undergoing a 'Big Build'. The project includes a dining hall extension, which was completed in 2016; new classrooms, including a new healthy living studio; a new sixth form centre with a lecture theatre and an IT suite, both completed in 2018; and a new sports hall and 25-metre indoor swimming pool with changing rooms, which are both currently being built. In 2017, the top floor of the science block, or 'S-block’, was refurbished to facilitate the Colchester Teacher Training Consortium (CTTC).

It was founded in 1909 as a girls' school for Colchester, and subsequently became a grammar school admitting girls from North East Essex and beyond on the basis of an 11+ selection test. The school is situated a mile to the west of central Colchester, and celebrated its centenary in 2009–2010.

Specialisms 
The school was one of the first Science Specialist Schools in the country. It later became a specialist Modern Language school too, teaching French and German as well as Latin.

School motto 
Wisdom Giveth Life has been the school's motto since the school opened in 1909. This reading is still included in the traditional school assembly at the start of each academic year:

"Ernst Ferdinand Nolte

Ernst Ferdinand Nolte (24 December 1791, Hamburg – 18 February 1875, Kiel) was a German botanist. He was son-in-law to chemist Christoph Heinrich Pfaff (1773–1852).

After duties as a pharmacy apprentice in Goslar, he studied medicine at the University of Göttingen. While a student, he engaged in frequent botanical excursions throughout northern Germany. In 1817 he finished his studies at Göttingen, and later came under the influence of Danish botanist Jens Wilken Hornemann (1770–1841). From 1821 to 1823 he conducted botanical investigations in Lauenburg and the ""Elbe Duchies"", later taking scientific excursions to Zealand, Funen, Jutland and islands off both coasts of the Schleswig-Holstein mainland.

From 1826 to 1873 he was a professor of botany at the University of Kiel, as well as director of its botanical garden. He was an instructor to Ferdinand von Mueller (1825–1896), who would later be known for his botanical work in Australia.

The plant genus Noltea from the family Rhamnaceae is named in his honor, as is Zostera noltei, a species of seagrass (named by Jens Wilken Hornemann, 1832).

Written works 
He made significant contributions to the botanical atlas Flora Danica, and was the author of the following publications:
 Botanische Bemerkungen über Stratiotes und Sagittaria, 1825
 Novitiæ floræ Holsaticæ : sive supplementum alterum Primitiarum floræ Holsaticæ G. H. Weberi, 1826
 Index seminum horti botanici Kiliensis, c. 1836–41.

"Rags Morales

Ralph ""Rags"" Morales () is an American comic book artist known for his work on various books for DC Comics, including Identity Crisis, Countdown to Infinite Crisis, Batman Confidential, and The New 52 reboot of then Superman-centric Action Comics.

Morales is the co-creator, along with Brian Augustyn, of the 1990s version of Black Condor.

Early life
Morales attended a number of vocational art classes, including The Kubert School.

Career
Morales' first professional work was penciling 19 issues of Forgotten Realms with writer Jeff Grubb as part of the TSR line of books. Following Forgotten Realms, Morales co-created and pencilled Black Condor.

Morales left DC Comics to do work for Valiant Comics, including Turok, Archer & Armstrong and Geomancer. He also did some licensed work on a Sliders comic book, and work for Wizards of the Coast. After Valiant closed, Morales returned to his TSR roots, doing work for Dungeons and Dragons magazines and novella work for Harper Collins, such as Isaac Asimov's Robotics and pen and ink work for Margaret Weis' Testament of the Dragon. He also taught anatomical illustration at a vo-tech school.

In 1999, Morales was made the penciler on DC's on Hourman, penciling 20 of that series 25 issues before it was canceled in 2001. Over the course of the following year, he drew nine intermittent issues of JSA between issue #9 and issue #34, before moving onto Hawkman with writer Geoff Johns. As the end of that year loomed while on Hawkman. It was also on Hawkman that he first worked with inker Michael Bair, with whom he has worked on most of his projects since. At the time Morales said ""when I saw the magic that Michael Bair added to my work, I knew I had to stick with this dude"".

After Hawkman, Morales illustrated Brad Meltzer's limited series Identity Crisis. Because of the importance of Identity Crisis to DC's ongoing company-wide storyline, and because of the number of characters in it, including minor ones that had barely been seen in years, Morales used copious amounts of reference materials for character studies, including the use of famous actors' faces to give the characters unique facial features, and sometimes updating their costumes in the process. The series was eventually selected by The Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA)'s 2007 recommended list of Great Graphic Novels For Teens.

Morales and Bair worked on Nightwing during Peter Tomasi's run as writer on that title. He later worked on Superman/Batman #53 - 56, which were among the seven issues collected in to the Finest Worlds hardcover in 2009, and in trade paperback form in 2010.

In 2009 he contributed to the ""Blackest Night"" storyline with the three issues miniseries, Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps.

In June 2011, as part of DC Comics' massive relaunch of their entire superhero line, Morales was announced as the artist on the new Action Comics #1, teaming with writer Grant Morrison.

In September 2018, Morales was named Inkwell Awards Special Ambassador.

Art style
Regarding his figure work, Morales finds stock, poster-like standing poses difficult, preferring the more communicative movement seen among characters in narrative sequences, a forte he feels helped him attain the Identity Crisis assignment.

"Fender Vibratone

The Fender Vibratone was a Leslie speaker designed for use with electric guitars, manufactured by Fender from 1967-1972. Named after the first Leslie speaker made for the Hammond Organ in 1941, the Vibratone was associated with the electric guitar, although it was used in vocals on many famous songs. The Vibratone was essentially an equivalent of the Leslie 16. A prime example of the Vibratone's sound is on the song ""Cold Shot"" by Stevie Ray Vaughan.

History
In the mid-1960s, guitarists, from bands like The Beach Boys, started experimenting by playing through Leslies. At the time, Fender was bought by CBS, who owned the patents to the Leslie company. The Fender Vibratone was introduced in 1967. Since its introduction, many groups like The Beatles, The Byrds, The Zombies, Blind Faith, as well as guitarists like Mike Campbell, David Gilmour, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, all have used the Vibratone in their recordings.

Design
Unlike a high fidelity speaker, the Vibratone was specifically designed to alter or modify the sound. It consisted of a single driver unit, particularly a 10-inch guitar speaker, with a 15-inch Styrofoam cylindrical rotor in front of it. The cylinder was mechanically rotated by a motor through a rubber belt to create various effects, like chorus and vibrato, based on the Doppler effect. Like a traditional Leslie, the effect could be changed, via a two-button footswitch, between slow and fast speeds, or switched off altogether.

Much of the Vibratone's unique tone comes from the fact that the cabinet uses a guitar speaker, instead of a horn and woofer. The effect was dispersed vertically, unlike the Leslie that is dispersed horizontally, with grilles on the sides and top of the cabinet. With no built-in preamp, the Vibratone had to be powered by a separate guitar amplifier; in recording situations, microphones were placed next to the grilles in order for the effect to be heard. A crossover was also built-in, with the Vibratone handling the mid-range frequencies, and sending the high/low frequencies to the driving amplifier.

Simulators
Today, many modeling devices, such as the Line 6 POD and Fender Cyber Twin, depict the sound of the Fender Vibratone. Early Rotary Speaker Simulators, like the Shin-ei Uni-Vibe or Dunlop Rotovibe pedals, became viable alternatives for guitarists, but never quite fully reproduced the Doppler effect they attempted to emulate.  Instead, they themselves became a new type of effect with their own sound signatures. Many cabinets similar to the Vibratone have come and gone, and there are a few models in current production as well. Guitar pedal manufacturers have also developed analog and digital pedals that quite realistically approximate the rotary effect. Here are a few examples (some may be out of production):
Dunlop Univibe,
Dunlop Rotovibe,
Univox Univibe,
Korg G4,
Pigtronix Rototron,
Line 6 Roto Machine,
Voodoo Lab Micro Vibe,
Hammond “Cream” Digital Leslie Pedal,

Neo Ventilator,
H&K Rotosphere,

"Unfinished Business (Battlestar Galactica)

""Unfinished Business"" is the ninth episode of the third season from the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. It aired on December 1, 2006.  Writer Michael Taylor received a nomination for the 2006 Nebula Award in the script category for this episode.

An extended version of this episode with 25 minutes of extra footage was included on the Region 1 DVD and Blu-ray releases of the third season and in the UK exclusively on the Blu-ray release

Plot 

Survivor Count: 41,422

The crew of Galactica have reinstated an old military tradition by setting up a boxing ring and putting rank aside — by the placing of dog tags in a metal box — crew and officers freely duke it out in one-on-one matches.  Colonel Tigh is match referee.

Elsewhere in a bunk room, Starbuck has finished having sex with her estranged husband Samuel T. Anders. Starbuck remarks that their encounter was just what she needed and gets up to leave.  Anders replies that he wants to reconcile their marriage. Starbuck responds that she's not ready yet and heads to the fights.

Kara heads past the boxing match and observes Major Apollo losing a match against Captain ""Helo"" Agathon. Apollo leaves the ring and picks up his dog tags to signify that he is quitting the competition.  However, Starbuck drops her tags in the box and goads an initially reluctant Apollo into fighting her instead.

Admiral Adama arrives with President Roslin, who is a boxing enthusiast, to watch the next series of fights; Kat wins against a female crew member, and Hot Dog is quickly knocked out by Starbuck.
 
Adama then observes Chief Tyrol and his wife Cally, recalling a moment when the fleet first settled New Caprica and Tyrol and Cally were still assigned to Galactica. Tyrol asked Adama for permission to leave the ship so he and Cally's child could be born and raised down on the planet. Adama refused the request, telling Tyrol he and Cally are needed on board.

Back at the boxing match, Adama overhears Tyrol give one of his crew permission to watch the fight although the crew member has not yet finished fixing a broken spacecraft. Without warning, the Admiral steps into the ring and tells Chief Tyrol to get his ""fat, lazy ass"" in there with him. Tyrol enters as ordered, thinking the match will be a joke until the bell rings and Adama knocks him to the mat with a fast right hook. Adama taunts Tyrol asking him if this is how he fought down on New Caprica. Insulted, Tyrol rises to his feet and begins to lay into the Admiral. Adama is easily over matched as Tyrol angrily pummels him into the ropes asking if this is what he wanted. Adama is saved for the moment by the bell. Adama sits to rest while Doctor Cottle looks him over. Roslin rushes to Adama's side and gives him some advice on how to win, but Adama replies that he does not intend to win.

Round two begins with Tyrol rushing Adama back into the ropes with more fierce pummelling. Adama does not do much to resist, with his face beaten to a bloody pulp. Tyrol eventually floors the old man who stays down for the count. A stunned silence falls over the crowd as Tyrol and Tigh help Adama back to his feet. The fight is over and Adama takes a moment to tell the crew that he has let them all get ""too close"" to him, something which must come to an end, and he will no longer forgive laxity among the crew as he's done in the past - he let them drop their guard during the initial settlement of New Caprica and left humanity exposed to the Cylons as a result. As the Admiral leaves, Tigh announces the matches are over and orders everyone back to duty.

Starbuck will not give up her planned fight with Apollo, however.  They both enter the ring and let loose with all their bottled up hostilities. As fists fly, flashbacks take the scene back to New Caprica. During the late evening of a ground-breaking ceremony, Apollo and Starbuck found a moment alone to talk. Starbuck had (literally) drunk Anders under the table, and he had passed out cold on the ground, under a table. Apollo took the opportunity to ask Starbuck about her plans for the future, musing about what will become of her relationship with Anders.

Back to the present, the boxing match between Starbuck and Apollo intensifies. Dee watches as Anders remarks that the two look like they'll kill each other.

On New Caprica the two eventually head outside the city to a secluded field and they end up making love. Afterward, Starbuck wonders what will happen if anyone finds out about what they have done — especially Anders or Dee. Apollo stands up and shouts to the night sky that he loves Kara Thrace, unconcerned about anyone hearing him. Hesitantly at first, Starbuck eventually does the same shouting that she loves Lee Adama. Apollo says he will tell Dee about the new situation and asks that Starbuck do the same with Anders.

In the boxing ring, Apollo knocks Starbuck to the mat at which point the fighting turns dirty. Starbuck does a leg sweep and trips Apollo. As he gets back to his feet, Starbuck kicks him in the face. Seeing the match is getting personal, the few remaining spectators begin to leave the room.

Flashing to the next morning on New Caprica, Admiral Adama and Roslin talk with Chief Tyrol and Cally. Adama tells Tyrol that he has given the Chief's situation some thought and that he has decided they can remain on New Caprica to have their child. Apollo awakes in the field and finds Starbuck has gone. Returning to the town, he meets his father, who tells him that Starbuck and Anders have just got married in a surprise ceremony earlier that morning. Still reeling from the news, Apollo meets the newlyweds walking down the street. Anders reveals that the wedding was Starbuck's idea and that she ""popped the question to him"" only that morning. Apollo recovers enough to congratulate Anders and wish him luck, adding that ""you're going to need it"" as he glances towards Starbuck. Apollo then walks off in a dazed shock back to a Raptor to return to Pegasus, with Dee waiting on the entry ramp. Apollo walks straight from his confrontation with Starbuck to Dee and immediately kisses her.

Back at the boxing ring, Starbuck and Apollo have battled each other to a stand-still. They slump against each other in the middle of the ring with their arms around each other. An awkward silence follows, and the spectators shuffle out of the hall. Anders leaves too, while Dee lowers her head. Starbuck whispers to Apollo that she has ""missed him"". Apollo replies that he missed her, too. As the scene fades out, there is the trace of a smile upon Starbuck's face.

"William Aberhart

William Aberhart (December 30, 1878 – May 23, 1943), also known as Bible Bill for his outspoken Baptist views, was a Canadian politician and the seventh Premier of Alberta (1935 to his death in 1943). He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend. Therefore, Aberhart argued that the government should give each Albertan $25 per month to spend to stimulate the economy, by providing needed purchasing power to allow needy customers to buy from waiting businesses.

During his premiership, Aberhart campaigned for and instituted several anti-poverty and debt relief programs, and other governmental reforms, such as consolidation of Alberta's numerous small school districts into centralized school divisions, and natural resources conservation. His attempts at banking reform met with less success, balked by opposition from the federal government, the courts, privately-owned newspapers and a coalition of the Liberal and Conservative parties. However, he did proceed to establish a government-owned banking chain, the Alberta Treasury Branches, which exist to this day, the only government banking system serving the public in North America.

Early life

Childhood, education, and family

William Aberhart was born December 30, 1878, in Tuckersmith Township (now part of Huron East, Ontario) to William (c. 1844 – 1910) and Louisa (c. 1850–1944) (née Pepper) Aberhart.  William Aberhart Sr. had immigrated to Canada from Germany with his family at the age of seven, while Louisa Pepper was born in Perth County, Ontario.  Historian Harold Schultz describes the Aberharts as ""prosperous"", while biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller says they ""lived better than the average family"".  The fourth of eight children, William Aberhart Jr. delivered milk to his father's customers before school each day.  At school, he was a hard-working but average student.  Mathematics was one of his strengths, though his approach involved more rote learning than reasoning.  Elliott and Miller suggest that this tendency stayed with him his entire life, and that he ""never really acquired an appreciation for inductive intellectual analysis"".  Aberhart was not a social child.  Though he excelled at soccer, he generally preferred solitary pursuits such as reading or teaching himself to play musical instruments.

In 1896, Aberhart attended three months of model school in Mitchell.  Although this training qualified him to work as a schoolteacher, he instead enrolled in business college in Chatham, from which he withdrew after four months of successful study.  In 1897–98, Aberhart attended Seaforth Collegiate Institute, where he was nicknamed ""Whitey"" (for his blond hair) and broadened his athletic prowess to include the long jump, shot put, 100-yard dash, high jump, cycling, and football.

On July 29, 1902, Aberhart married Jessie Flatt, whom he had met in 1901 at a football game.  A daughter, Khona Louise Aberhart, was born in the winter of 1903, and a second, Ola Janet Aberhart, followed in August 1905.

On July 20, 1910, William Aberhart Sr. died in an accident at a pharmacy owned by his son (William Jr.'s brother) Charles.  Prohibition was in effect, but pharmacists were permitted to provide alcohol for ""medicinal purposes"".  Charles kept a bottle of whiskey for William Sr. to drink whenever he was in the store.  One day a clerk rearranged the bottles, and the illiterate William Sr. took a swallow of carbolic acid; he died within minutes.  William Jr., by now in Calgary, did not make the trip east to his father's funeral.  Louisa Aberhart died February 20, 1911, outliving William Aberhart Sr. by less than a year.

Teaching career

In the fall of 1901 Aberhart was hired as a teacher at the Central Public School in Brantford, for which he was paid $60 per month.  He fast won a reputation as a strict disciplinarian: he addressed his students by number rather than name and was liberal in his use of the strap.  By his own account in a 1903 essay, he viewed the classroom as a battlefield, and admired Oliver Cromwell's military organization.  While his tactics divided his students—some loved him, while others recounted that ""he did everything he could to break the spirit of a child""—his supervisors gave him uniformly positive reviews.

His school's principal died in 1905, and Aberhart was selected to replace him; his salary increased to $1,000 per year.  This figure had reached $1,200 by 1910 when, in response to glowing reviews from his colleagues, the Calgary Board of Education offered him a principalship at $1,400 per year.  In response to a petition from his staff and students that this offer be matched by Brantford, Aberhart was offered a raise to $1,300; he declined it, and moved to Calgary that spring.  His family followed later, after he purchased a two-storey wooden house and Khona finished her academic year in Brantford.  1910 Calgary was a frontier town that smelled of horse manure and in which public drunkenness was common; though Aberhart's sensibilities were less shocked by this than his wife's were, he also had to make some adjustments: in Brantford he had always attended church in a silk top hat and frock coat, but he quickly abandoned this custom after discovering that he was the only one in Calgary to do so.

Aberhart was to become principal of Mount Royal School, but it was not yet complete at the time of his arrival, so he became the principal of Alexandra Public School immediately on his arrival.  Mount Royal was still not completed by the fall, so he took over the principalship of Victoria School, which he held until becoming principal of the new Crescent Heights High School in 1915.

Elliott and Miller write that Aberhart took a less rigid approach to discipline at Crescent Heights than he had in Ontario, though Schultz says that as principal he was ""authoritarian in manner and a strict disciplinarian"".  His love of organization persisted, and his penchant for it enhanced his reputation as ""an able administrator"".  Crescent Height's students scored very well on departmental examinations, though some members of the school board believed that he achieved this at least partly by culling weaker students with a preliminary qualifying examination.

One way Aberhart applied his organizational prowess was in creating one of Calgary's first and largest parent–teacher associations, which had an average of two hundred parents attend each meeting; Aberhart had a generally good relationship with parents.  His standing with his staff was more mixed: he had a habit of ""talking down"" to them, dominated the school to the point that teachers were left with little initiative, and, as Elliott and Miller put it, ""never entered the staff room except to issue an order"".  Many of his teachers, while respecting his abilities an administrator, thought very little of him as a man, and some believed that his domineering approach stemmed from a fear of people smarter than him.  In 1919, eight Crescent Heights teachers wrote the school board requesting an investigation into Aberhart's work; the resulting inspection led to the transfer of three male teachers—with whom Aberhart had a particularly poor rapport—to other schools, and stated that persisting problems would lead to a request for Aberhart's resignation.  A follow-up investigation two years later found a substantial improvement in conditions and reported favourably on Aberhart's abilities.  Despite this uneven relationship, Aberhart was not all together closed-minded, and would entertain—and sometimes even be convinced by—arguments from his staff.

Besides his administrative duties, Aberhart taught English and math.  True to form, in doing so he emphasized rote memorization at the expense of independent reasoning, to the point that one of his teachers once likened him to a dog trainer.  He cared for his students and provided extensive extra tutoring, especially for students in whom he saw a genuine interest in learning the material.  Outside of the classroom, he applied his talents to organizing picnics and games, and in 1922 organized an elected student council years before the concept became widespread in Calgary.  When some students wanted the school to purchase a movie projector not provided for in the school's budget, Aberhart organized a company into which students could buy for ten cents per share; the company put on movies for which it charged admission, and at the end of its first year of operation it declared a dividend of 25 cents per share.  He urged his students to adopt four axioms he followed in his own life: ""be enthusiastic, be ambitious, develop a distinctive personality, [and] have a hobby and ride it hard.""

In the assessment of John Barr, a Social Credit staffer years after Aberhart's death who later wrote one of the first histories of the party's years in power, ""Aberhart generally had the respect and admiration of a broad following of parents, teachers, and students.""  Schultz states that the only area in which all 61 people he interviewed in researching Aberhart's career agreed was that he was an excellent high school teacher.

Religion

Early religious views and adoption of Dispensationalism

Though his parents were not churchgoers, as a child Aberhart attended Sunday school at a Presbyterian church.  Under circumstances that are not clear to history, in high school he became a devout Christian.  He initially adopted Biblical literalism, though while at normal school he was exposed to more liberal versions of Christianity that taught the existence of internal inconsistencies in the Bible; for several years he adopted the approach of a Bible teacher who counselled him to ""treat [the] Bible as ... a nice plate of fish"" and ""eat the meat and leave the bones for the dogs"".  Though at first he subscribed to the notion of unconditional election, and worried about whether he was destined for salvation, he later adopted the Arminian doctrine of conditional election, and became confident that, through his faith, he would be saved.

While in Brantford, Aberhart studied at Zion Presbyterian church, where he became interested in Biblical prophecy, which in turn led him to Dispensationalism.  Dispensationalism held that history was divided into seven dispensations, during each of which God made a covenant with man, and during each of which man broke the covenant.  That the terms of the covenant were different in each dispensation resolved Aberhart's earlier concerns about the Bible's internal inconsistencies.  His views were heavily influenced by a correspondence course he took offered by American Dispensationalist Cyrus Scofield; Elliott and Miller speculate that such a course would have appealed to Aberhart by reducing ""difficult theological problems to a matter of memorizing questions and answers"".

In 1911, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.

Aberhart had aspired to take ministerial training at the Presbyterian Knox College Divinity School, but the church in Brantford was reluctant to take on the support of both him and his family in the four-year training period.  He became fascinated with prophetical teaching in the Bible and studied a correspondence course by the American evangelical theologian Cyrus Scofield. He had been introduced to this system while attending a men's Bible Class at Zion Presbyterian, taught by William Nichol, an elderly physician.

In 1910, Aberhart accepted a position as principal of Alexandra School in Calgary, Alberta. His initial Bible Study Teaching in Calgary commenced at the Grace Presbyterian Church at the Young Men's Bible Class. Within a few weeks attendance was over 100 and he attracted the attendance of the senior minister Dr. Esler, but his views on prophecy did not jibe with senior minister's reformed beliefs and his teaching privileges were cancelled. He then moved on to teach successively at the Wesley and Trinity Methodist Churches.  Although seeds of his interest in the Baptist faith had been planted while in Ontario, it was not until his involvement with Westbourne Baptist Church in Calgary as a lay preacher, that he and his wife were baptised in the Baptist faith.  He eventually lead Westbourne Baptist Church out of the Baptist Union of Western Canada in 1922.  In 1918, Aberhart began a Bible study group in Calgary, Alberta which grew steadily year-by-year; by 1923, the Palace Theatre had to be rented to accommodate those interested in Aberhart's message.  In 1925, radio station CFCN broadcast his Sunday sermons for the first time, taking his prophetic message beyond the confines of a theatre to listeners across the Prairies. In 1927, Aberhart was appointed Dean of the newly founded Calgary Prophetic Bible Institute. The institute's building served as a centre of worship, radio broadcast, and biblical studies. Aberhart's Sunday broadcasts proved as popular as his Bible studies as they drew regular listeners across western Canada, and some listeners in the northern United States. Towards the end of his life British Israelism became increasingly central to his theology. British Israelism had been an element of his theology from an early stage, but assumed further importance following the 1939 royal tour of Canada where he spoke with King George VI on the topic.

Political career

Aberhart became interested in politics during the Great Depression in Canada, a time which was especially harsh on Albertan and Saskatchewan farmers. Particularly, he was drawn to the Social Credit theories of Major C. H. Douglas, a British engineer. From 1932 to 1935, Aberhart lobbied for the governing political party, the United Farmers of Alberta, to adopt these theories, but it is doubtful that Aberhart fully understood the theories. The basis of Douglas's A+B theorem is that prices rise faster than incomes when regarded as a flow, and individuals' purchasing power should be supplemented through issuance of new credits which have not derived from the productive system. Aberhart's lobbying to encourage the United Farmers to adopt Social Credit principles was not successful.  He then helped found the Social Credit Party of Alberta, which won the 1935 provincial election by a landslide with over 54% of the popular vote and all but seven of the 63 seats in the legislature.

Not even the Socreds had expected to win the election. Indeed, its expectations were so low that it had not named a formal leader during the campaign. The party was now tasked with electing a leader who would become the province's new premier. Aberhart was the obvious choice, as he had been the party's founder and guiding force.  He initially said he didn't want the job, but was finally prevailed to accept the mantle of leadership.  He was formally sworn in as premier on September 3 (11 days after his August 22 victory).  However, he was not yet a member of the legislature. The Social Credit MLA for Okotoks-High River, William Morrison, resigned to give Aberhart a chance to get a seat, per standard practice in the Westminster system when a leader doesn't have a seat. Aberhart won the November 4 by-election, held prior to the first sitting of the Legislature after his government's election. Aberhart was elected by acclamation.

Aberhart served as his own Minister of Education and, starting in 1937, Attorney General.

His government did not implement much of the Social Credit policies promised in the party's election platform, because of the province's very poor financial position in the depths of the Depression. The federal government's opposition to Social Credit and the threat it held over Alberta during its hour of weakness were significant blocks to Aberhart moving forward. The federal government has jurisdiction over Canadian currency and banks, under the British North America Act. However, there was no constitutional barrier to Alberta producing its own currency, which Aberhart's government did to a limited degree with its Prosperity certificates. Aberhart did threaten the power of private banks with his government's extension of the UFA government's foreclosure moratorium and mandatory debt adjustment. It has been said that the reason Premier Aberhart knowingly went beyond constitutional limits with proposed legislation was because it won him support among the electorate, for at least trying to do what he promised. In his defence, he said the Establishment did not oppose Social Credit because it would not work but for fear it would work.

Lieutenant Governor John C. Bowen refused to give Royal Assent to three government bills in 1937. Two of the bills would have put the province's banks under the control of the provincial government, while a third, the Accurate News and Information Act, would have forced newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories the provincial cabinet deemed ""inaccurate"". All three bills were later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. For its leadership in the fight against the latter act, the Pulitzer Prize committee awarded the Edmonton Journal, the Calgary Herald, the Red Deer News, Lethbridge Herald and the province's weekly newspapers a Special Citation, the first time it was awarded outside the United States.

Aberhart instituted a variety of relief programs to help people out of poverty, as well as public works programs and a debt relief program that froze some debt collections and mortgage foreclosures. This, like Tommy Douglas' similar program in Saskatchewan, was later overturned in the mid-1940s by the Supreme Court, although it aided people for a number of years during and (for a short time) after the Great Depression.

Alberta's Social Credit government brought in legislation under which an MLA could be recalled by a portion of his/her constituents. Aberhart's own constituents, including out-of-power UFA farmers and many oilworkers working for U.S. oil companies threatened by Aberhart's Natural Resources Conservation legislation, gathered signatures for Aberhart's own recall. He thus became the first Canadian politician to be threatened with recall from office. Aberhart's government retroactively repealed the recall legislation rather than have Aberhart forced to give up his seat.

In keeping with his evangelical views, Aberhart added a heavy dose of social conservatism to Douglas' original ideas.  Most notably, he enacted very tight restrictions on the sale of alcohol.  Indeed, the only stricter law in Canada at the time was in Prince Edward Island, where the sale of alcohol remained completely banned until 1948.  Well into the 1960s, commercial airlines could not serve alcohol while flying over Alberta.

By late 1937, relations with the Lieutenant-Governor became so strained that Bowen even threatened to dismiss Aberhart's government, which would have been an extraordinary use of his reserve powers.  An analogous situation occurred in 1932 in Australia between Jack Lang and Sir Philip Game, the Premier and Governor, respectively, of New South Wales.  However, Bowen did not follow through on his threat due in part to Social Credit's immense popularity with the people.  Had he dismissed Aberhart, it would have triggered a fresh election that Social Credit would have almost certainly won.

Aberhart's government was re-elected in the 1940 election with a somewhat reduced mandate, with Aberhart being elected to a Calgary seat.

Although Aberhart was unable to gain control of Alberta's banks, his government gained a foothold in the province's financial industry by creating the Alberta Treasury Branches in 1938. Its operations included special credit given for those who bought made-in-Alberta goods. ATB has become Aberhart's legacy, operating as an orthodox financial institution and crown corporation.

Death and legacy 

Aberhart died unexpectedly on May 23, 1943, during a visit to his adult daughters in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Burnaby as his widow intended to move to Vancouver to be close to her children.  He was succeeded as the Premier of Alberta by his lifelong disciple, Ernest C. Manning, who gradually moved away from Douglas' monetary theories.  Social Credit would remain in office until its defeat in the 1971 election—one of the longest-serving provincial governments in Canadian history, and one of the longest-serving in the Commonwealth.

The Aberhart Centre, a long-term medical care centre at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, is named in his honour, as is William Aberhart High School in Calgary.

In 1974, he was named a Person of National Historic Significance by the Government of Canada. A plaque commemorating this sits inside Crescent Heights High School at 1019 1st NW, Calgary, Alberta.

Ideology 
Elliott (1978) argues that the Aberhart's Social Credit ideology was clearly antithetical to his previous theology, which was highly sectarian, separatist, apolitical, other-worldly, and eschatologically oriented.  Elliott challenges the arguments of Mann (1955) and Irving (1959) that there was a definite connection between Aberhart's theology and political program. Elliott reports that Aberhart's political support did not come from the sectarian groups as Mann and Irving suggest, but rather it came from the members of established churches and those with marginal religious commitment.

"John Thomas Davies

John Thomas Davies VC (29 September 1895 – 28 October 1955) was an English soldier and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that was awarded in the British Empire, and to this day in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth..

He was 22 years old and a corporal in the 11th (Service) Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's Volunteers), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 March 1918 near Eppeville, France, when his company was ordered to withdraw, Corporal Davies knew that the only line of withdrawal lay through a deep stream lined with a belt of barbed wire; he saw it imperative to hold up the enemy as long as possible. He mounted the parapet in full view of the enemy in order to get a more effective field of fire and kept his Lewis gun in action to the last, causing many enemy casualties and enabling part of his company to get across the river, which they would otherwise have been unable to do.

He was taken prisoner after the action. During World War II, he was a Captain in the Home Guard. He was buried in St. Helens Borough Cemetery, Lancashire, England. (C. of E. Section. Area 59. Grave 426.)

The Medal
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London, England.

Transfer Division
The Thiruvananthapuram-Nagercoil-Kanyakumari railway line was opened on Sixteenth April 1979, and was then under Madurai Division. Thiruvananthapuram  division was formed on second October 1979 carving out certain sections from Madurai division.  The Meter Gauge sections of Madurai division were retained, while all the newly laid Broad Gauge Sections of Madurai Division were transferred to Thiruvananthapuram  Division.  Thus, the Thiruvananthapuram-Nagercoil-Kanyakumari BG line, and the under-construction Tirunelveli-Nagercoil BG line were transferred to Thiruvananthapuram  Division.  It was then mentioned that when the Tirunelveli-Madurai line is converted into BG line the sections falling under Kanyakumari district and Tirunelveli District would be transferred back to Madurai Division. The Thrunelveli-Madurai line was converted into BG line on 8-4-1981 and ever since people from South Tamil Nadu have been demanding the merger of Kanyakumari BG line with Madurai Division.

Ever since its inception, Kanyakumari district has been willfully neglected by Thiruvananthapuram  division(like what Thiruvananthapuram  and Palakkad Divisions are neglected by Southern Railway), be it in providing Railway infrastructure, providing the required train services, passenger amenities etc.  Kanyakumari terminal station lacks the required Railway infrastructures and therefore request for more train services were always turned down by them citing the same handicap as the reason. Kanyakumari District people are demanding transfer Kanyakumari - Nagercoil - Kuzhithurai - Thiruvananthapuram  (except Thiruvananthapuram Station) and Nagercoil - Tirunelveli (up to Melappalayam) section to Madurai Division, at the earliest.  It is also stressed that under any circumstances, the above places should be under the administration of southern railway zone that is with Chennai only. Even in future also this area should not be attached with any other Zone including Trivandrum, Kerala.

"Sensory organs of gastropods

The sensory organs of gastropods (snails and slugs) include olfactory organs, eyes, statocysts and mechanoreceptors. Gastropods have no sense of hearing.

Olfactory organs 

In terrestrial gastropods the most important sensory organs are the olfactory organs which are located on the tips of the 4 tentacles. Some terrestrial gastropods can track the odor of food using their tentacles (tropotaxis) and the wind (anemotaxis).

In opisthobranch marine gastropods, the chemosensory organs are two protruding structures on top of the head. These are known as rhinophores. An opisthobranch sea slug Navanax inermis has chemoreceptors on the sides of its mouth to track mucopolysaccharides in the slime trails of prey, and of potential mates.

The freshwater snail Bithynia tentaculata is capable of detecting the presence of molluscivorous (mollusk-eating) leeches through chemoreception, and of closing its operculum to avoid predation.

The deepwater snail Bathynerita naticoidea can detect mussel beds containing the mussel Bathymodiolus childressi, because it is attracted to water that has cues in it from this species of mussel.

Eyes  

In terrestrial pulmonate gastropods, eye spots are present at the tips of the tentacles in the Stylommatophora or at the base of the tentacles in the Basommatophora. These eye spots range from simple ocelli that cannot project an image (simply distinguishing light and dark), to more complex pit and even lens eyes. Vision is not the most important requirement in terrestrial gastropods, because they are mainly nocturnal animals.

Some gastropods, for example the freshwater Apple snails (family Ampullariidae) and marine species of genus Strombus can completely regenerate their eyes. The gastropods in both of these families have lens eyes.

 Statocysts 

In the statocysts of Haliotis asinina'' was found the expression of a conserved gene (Pax-258 gene), which is also important for forming structures for balance in eumetazoans.

Mechanoreceptors 

The mechanoreceptors are very crucial to the snail's sensory.

"SLC22A12

Solute carrier family 22 (organic anion/cation transporter), member 12, also known as SLC22A12 and URAT1, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the SLC22A12 gene.

Function 
The protein encoded by this gene is a urate transporter and urate-anion exchanger which regulates the level of urate in the blood. This protein is an integral membrane protein primarily found in kidney. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Clinical significance
Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms of this gene are significantly associated with altered (increased or decreased) reabsorption of uric acid by the kidneys. Respectively, these altered rates of reabsorption contribute to hyperuricemia and hypouricemia.

Interactions 
SLC22A12 has been shown to interact with PDZK1.

Inhibition 
Lesinurad is a urate transporter inhibitor that has been approved to treat gout. Lesinurad enhances urate excretion by inhibition the tubular re-absorption. Probenecid also facilitates uric acid secretion.

"Elenski but

Elenski but ( or (more precisely but less commonly) , sometimes translated as Elena round or Elena leg) is a dry-cured ham from the town of Elena in northern Bulgaria and a popular delicacy throughout the country. The meat has a specific taste and can be preserved in the course of several years, owing much to the special process of making and the climatic conditions of the part of Stara Planina where Elena is located.

Preparation

The legs and quarters of the pig, traditionally singed and scraped, are taken from the body. Later the redundant parts are removed, so that the remaining meat is protected by hide or the skin that surrounds the muscle tissue. After the legs are shaped, they are well salted and put at the bottom of a postav, a special type of barrel designed for the occasion. The delicacy traditionally remains in salt for 40 days, then is taken out and left to dry.

Preservation technologies
There are various preservation technologies used to prepare elenski but these typically vary considerably from family to family, as opposed to regionally. In the past, the rounds were put in well trampled upon maize meal or processed with lime milk. The meat could also be stored in specially sewn bags of cheesecloth or wooden containers with thick nets instead of walls (muharnik), but as a rule were placed somewhere airy, where the clear mountain air could aid the drying and conservation, and also in order to prevent houseflies laying eggs on the rounds.

In many of the small towns around Elena, the rounds were in the past left in conservation in the rooms  where the daily house fire was lit, so that a certain amount of smoking could be achieved in order to add smoked flavour.

"The Electric Flag

The Electric Flag was an American blues rock soul group, led by guitarist Mike Bloomfield, keyboardist Barry Goldberg and drummer Buddy Miles, and featuring other musicians such as vocalist Nick Gravenites and bassist Harvey Brooks. Bloomfield formed the Electric Flag in 1967, following his stint with the Butterfield Blues Band. The band reached its peak with the 1968 release, A Long Time Comin', a fusion of rock, jazz, and R&B styles that charted well in the Billboard Pop Albums chart. Their initial recording was a soundtrack for The Trip, a movie about an LSD experience by Peter Fonda, written by Jack Nicholson and directed by Roger Corman.

History

Formation
With his appreciation for blues, soul and R&B, Bloomfield wanted to create a group of his own that would feature what he called ""American music."" He was inspired not only by the big band blues of B.B. King, T-Bone Walker, and Guitar Slim (Eddie Jones), but also by the contemporary soul sounds of Otis Redding, Steve Cropper, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and other Stax recording artists. He also drew inspiration from traditional country, gospel, and blues forms. Initially called the American Music Band, Bloomfield organized the band that would become known as The Electric Flag in the spring of 1967, not long after he produced a session with Chicago blues harmonica player James Cotton that featured a horn section. Bloomfield decided that his new band would also have horns and would play an amalgam of the American music he loved. 

The group was initially formed at the instigation of Bloomfield, and the assistance of Barry Goldberg. Harvey Brooks, who had previously worked with Bloomfield in 1965, recording Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited, joined as bassist, and recommended Buddy Miles, then 19 years old, who was the drummer at the time for Wilson Pickett. Brooks was working with Murray the K on the ""Music in the Fifth Dimension"" show at the RKO Theatre and was at Wilson Pickett's sound check/rehearsal watching Pickett fine Miles $50 a pop for missed cues. After the rehearsal Brooks approached Miles telling him about Bloomfield's credits, asking if he wanted to meet and talk about Bloomfield's new band. Miles was persuaded by Goldberg, Bloomfield and Brooks to leave Pickett. Initially, Bloomfield and Goldberg had asked Mitch Ryder to be the vocalist, since Bloomfield and Goldberg had been contributing to some Ryder recording sessions. Ryder declined the invitation, preferring to remain with the Detroit Wheels.  Bloomfield next approached Nick Gravenites, originally also from Chicago, who agreed.

Peter Strazza, whom Goldberg knew from Chicago, joined on tenor saxophone. Jazz guitarist Larry Coryell, who had developed his career in Seattle while a university student, recommended Seattle-based Marcus Doubleday on trumpet.

Career
Bloomfield and Goldberg developed the group in San Francisco, under Albert Grossman's management, and immediately began working on the band's first project: the soundtrack for the film The Trip. Actor Peter Fonda approached Bloomfield for the project, as a replacement for Gram Parsons' International Submarine Band. Director Roger Corman did not find the music of Parsons' band appropriate for a movie about the LSD experience.  At the time, the Electric Flag was rehearsing in Gram Parsons' Laurel Canyon, California home.

Bloomfield was solely credited for all of the compositions on the album. He hired keyboardist Paul Beaver to add texture to the soundtrack, through the use of one of the first Moog Synthesizers on record. The soundtrack recording was reportedly completed in ten days. While the movie received mixed reviews, the soundtrack attracted positive critical notice. As described by David Dann in his biography of the Electric Flag, ""The record was also one of the most adventurous for pop music in 1967, sampling freely from jazz, rock, blues and classical idioms, and doing so with wit and intelligence. It very much favored the eclectic approach toward American musical forms that Bloomfield wanted the new band to embody. That Michael could create such unusual and wide-ranging pieces said much for his appreciation and knowledge of those forms, and displayed his characteristic fearlessness when it came to experimentation.""

One of the Bloomfield compositions from The Trip soundtrack, ""Flash, Bam, Pow,"" was later included in the soundtrack to the 1969 film Easy Rider. The song was omitted from the release of the original soundtrack and has not been included in subsequent reissues.

The band made its debut appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival, the first of the 1960s rock music extravaganzas. Now called the Electric Flag, the group was well received by the audience of 55,000, though its performance fell short of Bloomfield's high standards. Following Monterey, the band toured the Northeast and perform in the San Francisco area while working on a recording for Columbia Records. Though a critical success, the band remained largely unknown to the general public due in part to the band's inability to complete its first album in a timely manner. In addition, Marcus Doubleday had joined the band as a heroin addict, while Peter Strazza, Barry Goldberg and Bloomfield developed heroin problems thereafter. In November 1967, Goldberg left the band in an effort to bring his personal circumstances under control. He was replaced by Michael Fonfara, at the time playing with David Clayton-Thomas in New York, and who was recommended by Buddy Miles. Fonfara was fired by Albert Grossman by December, after a drug bust in Los Angeles. As a result, he was replaced by Herb Rich, who had to perform a dual role on keyboards and sax. He had to handle that role until saxophonist Stemsy Hunter, who was a friend of Miles came on board in early 1968. Fonfara was shortly thereafter selected as the keyboard player for Rhinoceros, where he rebuilt his musical career. He spent the 1970s playing, recording and producing with Lou Reed, among other activities, prior to developing a successful career in Canada as a member of the Downchild Blues Band and as a producer of other artists.

Subsequent to completing the soundtrack to The Trip, the band commenced work on its long-awaited first album, A Long Time Comin'. The album, released in March 1968, was recorded between July 1967 and January 1968. The album was one of the first pop recordings to blend sound and voice samples with music. By early 1968, drummer Buddy Miles had become a dominant force in the band's musical direction. The group's repertory by then included numerous contemporary soul covers, featuring Miles on vocals, plus many classic blues tunes. The band produced fewer than a dozen original pieces, mostly written by vocalist Nick Gravenites.  Bloomfield's original ""American music"" concept appeared to have narrowed considerably. In terms of the band's original material, Miles Davis praised the Bloomfield–Goldberg composition, ""Over-Lovin' You"", in a Down Beat Blindfold Test in 1968.

By June 1968, only months after the release of the album, Bloomfield quit the group, based on exhaustion brought on by continuing insomnia that was ineffectively medicated through heroin. In the weeks prior to his departure, there had been much public speculation as to whether Bloomfield was leaving the group or whether the group was leaving him. Miles, rather than Bloomfield, had become the de facto leader of the group. Though they strove to carry on under Miles' direction, the Electric Flag was effectively finished. They issued the late 1968 album The Electric Flag: An American Music Band, but personality conflicts, differing aesthetics, and a series of drug problems hastened the band's downfall.

Epilogue
Though the Electric Flag was together in its original configuration less than a year, the band made a strong impression on critics and musicians, primarily in the San Francisco area where they were based. One of the first rock groups to include horns, the Electric Flag preceded the earliest edition of Blood, Sweat and Tears with Al Kooper.

Al Kooper left BS&T in April 1968, and was inspired by a jam recording with Moby Grape to organize the similarly structured Super Session album. The lineup included Electric Flag members Bloomfield, Brooks, and Goldberg. Bloomfield eventually dropped out of the sessions due to insomnia, and was replaced by Buffalo Springfield's Stephen Stills. Bloomfield and Kooper later toured together, while drummer and vocalist Buddy Miles went on to form the Buddy Miles Express and play in Jimi Hendrix's Band of Gypsys.  Bloomfield developed a solo career, commencing with the release of It's Not Killing Me in 1969, which included former Electric Flag bandmate Marcus Doubleday on trumpet.

Mike Bloomfield released several albums after this, including Nick Gravenites Live at the Fillmore which includes Taj Mahal doing ""One More Mile"". Buddy Miles started the Buddy Miles Express with a big hit ""Down By the River"". As noted Miles played with Hendrix in Band of Gypsies and then later with Carlos Santana. Miles died in 2008.

A reunion took place in 1974, with the Electric Flag releasing The Band Kept Playing, but the recording was not a commercial or critical success and the band quickly disbanded after several months of sporadic gigs. This lineup of the band featured Bloomfield, Goldberg, Miles, and Gravenites, along with new member Roger Troy on bass and vocals.

On July 28 and 29, 2007, a concert took place at the Monterey County Fairgrounds, commemorating the 40th Anniversary of the Monterey Pop Festival. One of the acts featured was a one-time reunion of The Electric Flag, anchored by original members Gravenites, Goldberg, and former member Hunter, backed by members of the Tower of Power and The Blues Project. The one-hour set featured material from the first album, as well as several blues covers.

"Leigh Howard Stevens

Leigh Howard Stevens (born March 9, 1953 in Orange, New Jersey) is a marimba artist best known for developing, codifying, and promoting the Stevens technique or Musser-Stevens grip, a method of independent four-mallet marimba performance based on the Musser grip.

Studies
Leigh Howard Stevens (LHS) studied under some of the most prominent percussion teachers and performers of his time, including jazz drummer Joe Morello, and marimbist Vida Chenoweth, with whom he studied in New Zealand the summer after his freshman year of college. LHS pursued his college studies at the Eastman School of Music planning to be a drum set player. Stevens recalls, ""I noticed when I got to Eastman that the techniques I was using--the one-handed roll, rotary strokes, doing Baroque trills with one hand, two-part Bach inventions, things like that--got a lot of attention. Other people seemed to think that I had a lot of talent on the marimba. I gradually began to realize that I had the potential of being a much better marimba player than I had of becoming a world-class drum set player.""  Stevens' promptly switched to concert percussion, studied with John Beck and received a Performer's Certificate.

Method of Movement for Marimba
During the 1970s, LHS began writing down his thoughts and exercises he invented in order to facilitate the mastery of this new technique. The result was his pedagogical treatise Method of Movement for Marimba, first published in 1979 by his own company, Marimba Productions. Method of Movement for Marimba describes Stevens' method for holding marimba mallets, efficient utilization of motion, and includes over 500 musical exercises for the student.  Method of Movement (often shortened to MOM) was the first textbook to fully describe a complete method for holding and playing with 4 mallets. LHS came up with the technique after learning several other grips and considers his technique an outgrowth of the Musser grip. The Stevens technique is defined by a vertical hand position (in contrast to the previous flat-palmed Musser player), pivoting around either unused mallet (instead of lifting the unused mallet out of the way), and moving the end of the inside mallet through the palm for larger intervals.

Stroke Types
Single Independent Strokes: the ability to strike single (or repeated single) strokes without moving the unused mallet held in that hand.

Single Alternating Strokes: executed as if they were alternating single independent strokes, these strokes consist of discrete, side to side rockings of the hand.

Double Vertical Strokes: a stroke that produces two pitches simultaneously. (It is somewhat of ""double stop"" with one hand).

Double Lateral Strokes: single motions that produce two successive pitches. It begins as a double vertical stroke but goes through a split second metamorphosis where one mallet strikes before the other.

Performance
Stevens' performance at the first PASIC (Percussive Arts Society International Convention) in Rochester, New York in 1976 was a seminal event for all in attendance.  For the first time, many percussion performers and teachers were seeing someone performing with a quasi-Musser grip but with an unprecedented degree of flexibility.  Stevens was not attempting to revolutionize the percussion world; rather, he was merely performing in what he thought was a natural method for the marimba.

LHS continues to be an active performer and clinician worldwide and has appeared at a dozen Percussive Arts Society International Conventions (PASIC) since 1976, and served as Professor of Marimba at the Royal Academy of Music in London, England from 1997-2004. From 1980 to the present, he has held a three-week Summer Marimba Seminar in Ocean Grove,  New Jersey where an average of 30 students from around the world come participate in an intensive study of music and the Stevens’ technique with LHS himself.

On November 10, 2006, Stevens was officially inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame during the 2006 PASIC in Austin, Texas. He is an alumnus of Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey and was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame.

Marimba Productions, Inc.
Stevens started his own publishing company, Marimba Productions, in 1979 because he could not find a publishing company for his MOM manuscript. Still in business today, Marimba Productions Inc. comprises Malletech instruments and mallets, Keyboard Percussion Publications, and Resonator Records.  Marimba Productions Inc. also includes  acquisitions: Music Project, M.Baker Publications, Percussion Arts and Studio 4 Music.

"Elena Cuza

Elena Cuza (17 June 1825 – 2 April 1909), also known under her semi-official title Elena Doamna, was a Moldavian, later Romanian noblewoman and philanthropist. She was princess consort of the United Principalities and the wife of Alexander John Cuza.

Biography

The daughter of postelnic Iordache Rosetti, a high-ranking boyar of the Rosetti family, she was also closely related to the Sturdzas and other families of boyars. Born in Iaşi, she married Cuza in 1844 — their relationship soured soon after, as Elena was not able to bear a child. However, she later raised as her own children his two sons by his mistress, Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenović.

She remained, however, very devoted to her husband in their public life, and was responsible for securing his flight from the country in 1848, after Prince Mihail Sturdza began arresting participants in the Moldavian revolutionary movement. They returned after the start of Grigore Alexandru Ghica's rule, but Elena suffered from depression after Cuza began engaging in adulterous affairs and left for Paris, France until 1853. After her return, she became almost completely estranged from her husband, who kept as his mistress Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenović, the mother of Milan Obrenović (future Prince of Serbia).

Elena left for Paris and remained there until 1862, long after the ad hoc Divan had elected Cuza ruler; she had been persuaded to do so by the writer and political figure Vasile Alecsandri, who tried to extinguish the scandal provoked by Cuza's marital neglect. As wife of the head of state, she became noted for her charity work (the building of the Elena Doamna Asylum in Cotroceni, Bucharest) and adopted orphans, including the illegitimate children of her husband — Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza and Dimitrie Cuza; Elena Cuza took over, furnished, and maintained the private residence in Ruginoasa, Iaşi County, and was responsible for the Neo-gothic style of its decorations.

During the coup d'état against her husband (22 February 1866), she was isolated in her apartments by the conspirators, who burst in on Cuza as he was spending the night with Maria Catargi-Obrenović. Both she and Maria joined Cuza in his European exile. After her husband's death in 1873, she took care of their children, and lived to see the death of her two adoptive sons (Alexandru, was the husband of Maria Moruzi - she was later married, for just one day, with the National Liberal leader Ion I. C. Brătianu, and gave birth to the historian and politician Gheorghe I. Brătianu).

"Monroe Community College

Monroe Community College is a public community college in Monroe County, New York. It is part of the State University of New York. The college has two campuses; the main campus in the town of Brighton, and the Downtown Campus in the City of Rochester. The college also has off-site learning at the Applied Technologies Center, Monroe County Public Safety Training Facility, and extension sites in East Rochester, Greece, Spencerport, Webster, and online.

History
The origins of what became known as Monroe Community College begin in 1960, when a well-known local physician, Dr. Samuel J. Stabins (1901 - 1989) recognized the need to prepare students to work in hospitals and health care facilities. In 1961, MCC became part of the SUNY system, and its program offerings were expanded to prepare graduates for employment, or transfer to a four-year institution. Initially, the college was lodged in East High School located at 410 Alexander Street. The location was condemned by the city as a fire hazard, which forced the school to make renovations. On September 9, 1962, the original campus re-opened with the first class of 720 students.

Three years later in June 1965, MCC became the first college in the nation to receive accreditation within three years of its founding. Due to increasing enrollment, the college overflowed its first location's capacity. In 1968, the college moved to its present main campus on East Henrietta Road in Brighton. In 1991, the college announced plans for a second campus to serve a steady influx of students. The Damon City Campus, named in honor of longtime Trustee E. Kent Damon, opened its doors the following year in downtown Rochester, and educates students in law, criminal justice, human services and K-12 teaching.

, MCC has served more than a quarter of a million people. Within the past several years MCC has welcomed the additions of the Louis S. and Molly B. Wolk Center for Excellence in Nursing, and the PAC fitness and recreational facility.

Presidents

Campuses
MCC occupies two campuses:  the  main campus on 1000 East Henrietta Road in the Town of Brighton, New York and the Downtown Campus on 321 State Street near Frontier Field and Kodak Tower.  MCC also offers classes at the Applied Technologies Center on West Henrietta Road which includes automotive technologies, heating/cooling ventilation, and precision tooling and machinery. In addition, they train law enforcement,  fire safety, and emergency medical services personnel at the county Public Safety Training Facility.

Academics

Today, Monroe Community College hosts a diverse student body and offers 83 degree and certification programs.

Of the approximately 41,000 students who take classes through Monroe Community College annually, more than 65 percent are under 25 years old, and more than half are women. The majority of students are enrolled in certificate and degree programs. In addition, the college trains the area's workforce through open enrollment and corporate training programs, serving small to mid-size employers such as Melles Griot and large employers including Kodak and Xerox.

Many students opt to take a ""2+2"" transfer program, in which they enroll in a program to earn their associate degree in two years with the intent of transferring to a college or university — primarily the University of Rochester, Rochester Institute of Technology, Saint John Fisher College, Roberts Wesleyan College, SUNY Geneseo, SUNY Brockport, Nazareth College, or the Eastman School of Music — to complete a bachelor's degree.

Graduates of MCC have moved on to more than 100 different schools. In 2005, 2,680 people graduated from the college. Of those who transferred to another college, 62 percent chose one of the region's four-year colleges and universities. Of those graduates who enrolled at MCC to prepare for a career, 89 percent stayed in the greater Rochester area and found work in many local industries.

Student life

Students maintain a regular newspaper, The Monroe Doctrine, which includes both a bi-weekly print version and an online version. The radio station (closed circuit/web feed only) is also student operated and there are 57 student clubs and organizations for students to participate in.

The Student Association, of which all currently enrolled student life fee-paying students are members, is governed by the Brighton Campus Student Government Association (SGA) and the Damon Campus Student Events and Governance Association (SEGA). 

The Campus Activities Board (CAB) is the events organization at MCC. The CAB sponsors on-campus activities such as Freestyle Fridays, Fall Fest and Spring Fling. CAB also brings in Guest Speakers to present on various current issues facing students.

Phi Theta Kappa, the international honor society of two-year colleges and academic programs, has a chapter on the MCC campus.  The chapter also participates in the Honors in Action Study Topic and the College Project to remain a 5-star chapter.

MCC offers smart classrooms, interactive videoconferencing capabilities, eight electronic learning centers (the largest of which has 100+ workstations), the Warshof Conference Center (open to the public), dental clinic, fitness and dance studios, a new synthetic turf field, and a variety of dining and restaurant options on campus. Brighton Campus is one of the few college campuses that is nearly completely enclosed. The Brighton Campus, along with the Applied Technologies Center on West Henrietta Road and the Downtown Campus is completely wireless. In 2008, a . athletics facility – the PAC Center – was added to the Brighton Campus.

Unlike most U.S. community colleges, MCC provides residence halls for on-campus living. In 2003, the Alice Holloway Young Residence Halls opened on the Brighton Campus. Today, four more buildings have been added: Alexander Hall, Canal Hall, Pioneer Hall, and Tribune Hall.

Athletics
The college athletic teams are nicknamed the Tribunes.

Title IX 
On April 27th 2016 the department of Education opened a federal Investigation to investigate if MCC had violated Title IX. The investigation is currently still underway.

"Saltillo, Nebraska

Saltillo ( ) was an unincorporated community in Lancaster County, Nebraska, in the United States.

History 
The settlement of Saltillo was formerly located along the Salt Creek where the corners of Grant, Centerville, Yankee Hill, and Saltillo townships meet. Originally a community was planned at the site to be named Olathe. In 1862, John Cadman built a road ranch called Saltillo Station in the area to provide lodgings for travelers along the Oregon Trail between Nebraska City and Fort Kearny. A post office was established at Saltillo in 1862, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1906. The community was likely named after the city of Saltillo, Mexico. The name is derived from the Spanish word salto, meaning leap, the diminutive suffix renders the meaning of the name ""little leap.""

Saltillo remained a small community for its entire existence, never exceeding a population of 50 people. The village economy relied heavily on wagon train traffic from the Oregon Trail, which became obsolete in 1865 with the construction of the Transcontinental Railroad. Two railroads passed through Saltillo, the Atchison and Nebraska Railroad in 1872 and the a branch line of the Union Pacific called the Omaha and Republican Valley Railroad in 1883. The Atchison and Nebraska Railroad was later sold to Chicago, Burlington & Quincy in 1908.

Plat maps produced in 1903 show the village with three streets and the path of Salt Creek flowing through roughly half of the lots. Frequent flooding, a lack of travelers and thus income, as well as the continuous growth of nearby Lincoln all sent the population of Saltillo into decline. By the 1950s, the last visible remnant of Saltillo was the grain elevator which was torn down in 1953.

"Powership

A powership (or power ship) is a special purpose ship, on which a power plant is installed to serve as a power generation resource.

A powership is an existing ship that has been modified for power generation, a marine vessel, on which a power plant is installed to serve as a power generation resource. Converted from existing ships, powerships are self-propelled, ready to go infrastructure for developing countries that plug into national grids where required. Unmotorised powerships, known as power barges, are  power plants installed on a deck barge. These are sometimes called ""floating power plants"" or ""barge mounted power plants"". They were initially developed during World War II by General Electric for the War Production Board as a transportable large-scale power generation resource.

Powerships or power barges can be equipped with single or multiple gas turbines, reciprocating diesel and gas engines, boilers or nuclear reactors for electricity generation. Bureau Veritas, an international certification agency with experience in overseeing both shipbuilding and power plant development, classifies such floating power plants as ""special service power plants"".

History

One of the earliest powerships was the SS Jacona, built in 1931 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Virginia for the New England Public Service Company of Augusta, Maine. The idea came to the president of the Augusta firm, when one winter a severe winter storm took out a lot of the New England major power transmission lines.  The role of the Jacona would be to dock as near as possible to the affected area and hook into the local power grid, restoring power.  During the summer months the Jacona would hook into vacation area power grids where power needs are extremely low during off season and extremely high during the summer vacation season.  The Jacona was fitted with steam boilers which drove two generators which could produce 10 MW each.

At one time the US Navy used its submarines when disaster hit a local community that brought down the commercial power grid, which led to the idea of powerships for the US Navy, and an early US Navy powership was the , a former US Navy naval ship. Saranac was a 1942 built fleet oiler before her conversion into a powership following the Second World War to serve in the US Navy and Army. In 1957, she was sold to Hugo Neu Corporation of New York City and was used then as a power facility abroad by the International Steel and Metal Corporation. In 1959, she was renamed Somerset.

The first floating nuclear reactor ship was the MH-1A, used in the Panama canal zone from 1968 to 1975.  This ship (named Sturgis) was decommissioned and scrapped over the period of 2015 to 2019 .

Power barges and power ships offer a number of advantages over other forms of power plants; due to their mobility, powerships can be connected to local power grids to temporarily cover demands whenever on site power plants are insufficient or the building of new power plants will take time, while dual-fuel engines on board can be powered by either liquid fuels or gas. The power barge and power ship are able to use any infrastructure available at the site on which she is required.

Current usage
Some recently built power ships are existing large bulk carriers, which are fitted with used reciprocating engines and new state-of-the-art, large-bore dual-fuel diesel engines that run on heavy fuel or natural gas to generate electricity, relevant transformers and electric switchboards. The only other power ships were based on US Naval vessels. Power ships utilizing new purpose built ships would not be competitive to a purpose built power barge due to the higher cost of construction.  The crew quarters and propulsion systems are under utilized during the power plant operational period which can be up to the life of the power plant.

It is expected that a power barge or power ship could moor at one place for an average duration of three to five years on a lease, or up to 20 years under a PPA. For this reason, power ships if constructed already, are a solution to bridge the gap for a certain time until a local power plant is built or the high demand in electricity supply is over.

Karadeniz Powership Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Karadeniz Energy Group based in Turkey, developed and carries out a project named ""Power of Friendship"" that aims to provide a total of 2,010 MW of electricity to more than ten shortage-stricken countries in the Middle East, northern Africa and southern Asia with ten different ships by the end of 2010. The first powership of the project, which can supply 144 MW power, went into service at the beginning of 2010 off the shore near Basra in south-eastern Iraq, and the second powership is on its way to the same place. The company also signed a contract with Pakistan, but the Pakistani government terminated this project.  This case in now being heard in the World Bank Tribunal.

All other builders of power ships have gone out of business as power barges have proved to be more cost effective.

From Bangladesh to USA

During the 1990s, power barges became a popular way of providing energy to developing nations, with companies including equipment suppliers like General Electric, Westinghouse, Wärtsilä, and MAN; by developers such as Smith Cogeneration, AES, GMR Vasavi, which operate floating power plants for customers located in New York City (United States), Khulna (Bangladesh), the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Ecuador, Angola, Nigeria, Thailand, Effassu (Ghana), as well as in the Philippines, Jamaica, Kenya and Malaysia. Engineering, procurement and construction companies such Power Barge Corporation, Waller Marine Inc, Hyundai, IHI Corporation and Mitsui offer gas turbine power barge construction programs, and Karadeniz Energy, MAN and Wärtsilä offer medium speed engine power barges.

Today there are over 75 power barges deployed and operating around the world. The utilization rate of power barges is around 95% with only one or two power barges available in the global market at any one time.

In April 2011, Waller Marine finalized installation in Venezuela of two large floating power generation barges into a prepared basin at Tacoa. The two 171 MW barges, each supporting a GE 7FA dual fuel industrial gas turbine, are connected to the grid and soon supply much needed power to Caracas. Power Barge Corporation recently delivered a 96 MW gas turbine power barge to Angola, a 72 MW Wartsila power barge to Panama and a 105 MW gas turbine power barge to Venezuela.  

In 2018 two Chinese companies announced that they would build a fleet of nuclear power barges for the South China Sea islands.

"Born–Oppenheimer approximation

In quantum chemistry and molecular physics, the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is the assumption that the motion of atomic nuclei and electrons in a molecule can be treated separately. The approach is named after Max Born and J. Robert Oppenheimer who proposed it in 1927, in the early period of quantum mechanics. The approximation is widely used in quantum chemistry to speed up the computation of molecular wavefunctions and other properties for large molecules. There are cases where the assumption of separable motion no longer holds, which make the approximation lose validity (it is said to ""break down""), but is then often used as a starting point for more refined methods.

In molecular spectroscopy, using the BO approximation means considering molecular energy as a sum of independent terms, e.g.: . These terms are of different order of magnitude and the nuclear spin energy is so small that it is often omitted. The electronic energies  consist of kinetic energies, interelectronic repulsions, internuclear repulsions, and electron–nuclear attractions, which are the terms typically included when computing the electronic structure of molecules.

Example 

The benzene molecule consists of 12 nuclei and 42 electrons. The Schrödinger equation, which must be solved to obtain the energy levels and wavefunction of this molecule, is a partial differential eigenvalue equation in the three-dimensional coordinates of the nuclei and electrons, giving 3×12 + 3×42 = 36 nuclear + 126 electronic = 162 variables for the wave function. The computational complexity, i.e. the computational power required to solve an eigenvalue equation, increases faster than the square of the number of coordinates.

When applying the BO approximation, two smaller, consecutive steps can be used:
For a given position of the nuclei, the electronic Schrödinger equation is solved, while treating the nuclei as stationary (not ""coupled"" with the dynamics of the electrons). This corresponding eigenvalue problem then consists only of the 126 electronic coordinates. This electronic computation is then repeated for other possible positions of the nuclei, i.e. deformations of the molecule. For benzene, this could be done using a grid of 36 possible nuclear position coordinates. The electronic energies on this grid are then connected to give a potential energy surface for the nuclei. This potential is then used for a second Schrödinger equation containing only the 36 coordinates of the nuclei.

So, taking the most optimistic estimate for the complexity, instead of a large equation requiring at least  hypothetical calculation steps, a series of smaller calculations requiring  (with N being the amount of grid points for the potential) and a very small calculation requiring  steps can be performed. In practice, the scaling of the problem is larger than  and more approximations are applied in computational chemistry to further reduce the number of variables and dimensions.

The slope of the potential energy surface can be used to simulate Molecular dynamics, using it to express the mean force on the nuclei caused by the electrons and thereby skipping the calculation of the nuclear Schrödinger equation.

Detailed Description 
The BO approximation recognizes the large difference between the electron mass and the masses of atomic nuclei, and correspondingly the time scales of their motion. Given the same amount of kinetic energy, the nuclei move much more slowly than the electrons. In mathematical terms, the BO approximation consists of expressing the wavefunction () of a molecule as the product of an electronic wavefunction and a nuclear (vibrational, rotational) wavefunction. . This enables a separation of the Hamiltonian operator into electronic and nuclear terms, where cross-terms between electrons and nuclei are neglected, so that the two smaller and decoupled systems can be solved more efficiently.

In the first step the nuclear kinetic energy is neglected, that is, the corresponding operator Tn is subtracted from the total molecular Hamiltonian. In the remaining electronic Hamiltonian He the nuclear positions are no longer variable, but are constant parameters (they enter the equation ""parametrically""). The electron–nucleus interactions are not removed, i.e., the electrons still ""feel"" the Coulomb potential of the nuclei clamped at certain positions in space. (This first step of the BO approximation is therefore often referred to as the clamped-nuclei approximation.)

The electronic Schrödinger equation

is solved approximately The quantity r stands for all electronic coordinates and R for all nuclear coordinates. The electronic energy eigenvalue Ee depends on the chosen positions R of the nuclei. Varying these positions R in small steps and repeatedly solving the electronic Schrödinger equation, one obtains Ee as a function of R. This is the potential energy surface (PES): Ee(R) . Because this procedure of recomputing the electronic wave functions as a function of an infinitesimally changing nuclear geometry is reminiscent of the conditions for the adiabatic theorem, this manner of obtaining a PES is often referred to as the adiabatic approximation and the PES itself is called an adiabatic surface.

In the second step of the BO approximation the nuclear kinetic energy Tn (containing partial derivatives with respect to the components of R) is reintroduced, and the Schrödinger equation for the nuclear motion

is solved. This second step of the BO approximation involves separation of vibrational, translational, and rotational motions. This can be achieved by application of the Eckart conditions. The eigenvalue E is the total energy of the molecule, including contributions from electrons, nuclear vibrations, and overall rotation and translation of the molecule.

 In accord with the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, the nuclear potential is taken to be an average over electron configurations of the sum of the electron–nuclear and internuclear electric potentials.

Derivation
It will be discussed how the BO approximation may be derived and under which conditions it is applicable. At the same time we will show how the BO approximation may be improved by including vibronic coupling. To that end the second step of the BO approximation is generalized to a set of coupled eigenvalue equations depending on nuclear coordinates only. Off-diagonal elements in these equations are shown to be nuclear kinetic energy terms.

It will be shown that the BO approximation can be trusted whenever the PESs, obtained from the solution of the electronic Schrödinger equation, are well separated:

.

We start from the exact non-relativistic, time-independent molecular Hamiltonian:

with

The position vectors  of the electrons and the position vectors  of the nuclei are with respect to a Cartesian inertial frame. Distances between particles are written as  (distance between electron i and nucleus A) and similar definitions hold for  and .

We assume that the molecule is in a homogeneous (no external force) and isotropic (no external torque) space. The only interactions are the two-body Coulomb interactions among the electrons and nuclei. The Hamiltonian is expressed in atomic units, so that we do not see Planck's constant, the dielectric constant of the vacuum, electronic charge, or electronic mass in this formula. The only constants explicitly entering the formula are ZA and MA – the atomic number and mass of nucleus A.

It is useful to introduce the total nuclear momentum and to rewrite the nuclear kinetic energy operator as follows:

Suppose we have K electronic eigenfunctions  of , that is, we have solved

The electronic wave functions  will be taken to be real, which is possible when there are no magnetic or spin interactions. The parametric dependence of the functions  on the nuclear coordinates is indicated by the symbol after the semicolon. This indicates that, although  is a real-valued function of , its functional form depends on .

For example, in the molecular-orbital-linear-combination-of-atomic-orbitals (LCAO-MO) approximation,  is a molecular orbital (MO) given as a linear expansion of atomic orbitals (AOs). An AO depends visibly on the coordinates of an electron, but the nuclear coordinates are not explicit in the MO. However, upon change of geometry, i.e., change of , the LCAO coefficients obtain different values and we see corresponding changes in the functional form of the MO .

We will assume that the parametric dependence is continuous and differentiable, so that it is meaningful to consider

which in general will not be zero.

The total wave function  is expanded in terms of :

with

and where the subscript  indicates that the integration, implied by the bra–ket notation, is over electronic coordinates only. By definition, the matrix with general element

is diagonal. After multiplication by the real function  from the left and integration over the electronic coordinates  the total Schrödinger equation

is turned into a set of K coupled eigenvalue equations depending on nuclear coordinates only

The column vector  has elements . The matrix  is diagonal, and the nuclear Hamilton matrix is non-diagonal; its off-diagonal (vibronic coupling) terms  are further discussed below. The vibronic coupling in this approach is through nuclear kinetic energy terms.

Solution of these coupled equations gives an approximation for energy and wavefunction that goes beyond the Born–Oppenheimer approximation.
Unfortunately, the off-diagonal kinetic energy terms are usually difficult to handle. This is why often a diabatic transformation is applied, which retains part of the nuclear kinetic energy terms on the diagonal, removes the kinetic energy terms from the off-diagonal and creates coupling terms between the adiabatic PESs on the off-diagonal.

If we can neglect the off-diagonal elements the equations will uncouple and simplify drastically. In order to show when this neglect is justified, we suppress the coordinates in the notation and write, by applying the Leibniz rule for differentiation, the matrix elements of  as

The diagonal () matrix elements  of the operator  vanish, because we assume time-reversal invariant, so  can be chosen to be always real. The off-diagonal matrix elements satisfy

The matrix element in the numerator is

The matrix element of the one-electron operator appearing on the right side is finite.

When the two surfaces come close, , the nuclear momentum coupling term becomes large and is no longer negligible. This is the case where the BO approximation breaks down, and a coupled set of nuclear motion equations must be considered instead of the one equation appearing in the second step of the BO approximation.

Conversely, if all surfaces are well separated, all off-diagonal terms can be neglected, and hence the whole matrix of  is effectively zero. The third term on the right side of the expression for the matrix element of Tn (the Born–Oppenheimer diagonal correction) can approximately be written as the matrix of  frid and, accordingly, is then negligible also. Only the first (diagonal) kinetic energy term in this equation survives in the case of well separated surfaces, and a diagonal, uncoupled, set of nuclear motion equations results:

which are the normal second step of the BO equations discussed above.

We reiterate that when two or more potential energy surfaces approach each other, or even cross, the Born–Oppenheimer approximation breaks down, and one must fall back on the coupled equations. Usually one invokes then the diabatic approximation.

The Born–Oppenheimer approximation with the correct symmetry
To include the correct symmetry within the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) approximation, a molecular system presented in terms of (mass-dependent) nuclear coordinates  and formed by the two lowest BO adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PES)  and  is considered. To ensure the validity of the BO approximation, the energy E of the system is assumed to be low enough so that  becomes a closed PES in the region of interest, with the exception of sporadic infinitesimal sites surrounding degeneracy points formed by  and  (designated as (1, 2) degeneracy points).

The starting point is the nuclear adiabatic BO (matrix) equation written in the form

 

where  is a column vector containing the unknown nuclear wave functions ,  is a diagonal matrix containing the corresponding adiabatic potential energy surfaces , m is the reduced mass of the nuclei, E is the total energy of the system,  is the gradient operator with respect to the nuclear coordinates , and  is a matrix containing the vectorial non-adiabatic coupling terms (NACT):

Here  are eigenfunctions of the electronic Hamiltonian assumed to form a complete Hilbert space in the given region in configuration space.

To study the scattering process taking place on the two lowest surfaces, one extracts from the above BO equation the two corresponding equations:

where  (k = 1, 2), and  is the (vectorial) NACT responsible for the coupling between  and .

Next a new function is introduced:

and the corresponding rearrangements are made:

1. Multiplying the second equation by i and combining it with the first equation yields the (complex) equation

2. The last term in this equation can be deleted for the following reasons:  At those points where  is classically closed,  by definition, and at those points where  becomes classically allowed (which happens at the vicinity of the (1, 2) degeneracy points) this implies that: , or . Consequently, the last term is, indeed, negligibly small at every point in the region of interest, and the equation simplifies to become

In order for this equation to yield a solution with the correct symmetry, it is suggested to apply a perturbation approach based on an elastic potential , which coincides with  at the asymptotic region.

The equation with an elastic potential can be solved, in a straightforward manner, by substitution. Thus, if  is the solution of this equation, it is presented as

where  is an arbitrary contour, and the exponential function contains the relevant symmetry as created while moving along .

The function  can be shown to be a solution of the (unperturbed/elastic) equation

Having , the full solution of the above decoupled equation takes the form

where  satisfies the resulting inhomogeneous equation:

In this equation the inhomogeneity ensures the symmetry for the perturbed part of the solution along any contour and therefore for the solution in the required region in configuration space.

The relevance of the present approach was demonstrated while studying a two-arrangement-channel model (containing one inelastic channel and one reactive channel) for which the two adiabatic states were coupled by a Jahn–Teller conical intersection.  A nice fit between the symmetry-preserved single-state treatment and the corresponding two-state treatment was obtained. This applies in particular to the reactive state-to-state probabilities (see Table III in Ref. 5a and Table III in Ref. 5b), for which the ordinary BO approximation led to erroneous results, whereas the symmetry-preserving BO approximation produced the accurate results, as they followed from solving the two coupled equations.

The city is part of the Effingham, IL Micropolitan Statistical Area. Effingham is home to a 198 foot tall cross, The Cross at the Crossroads. The cross is the tallest cross in the United States.

The city bills itself as ""The Crossroads of Opportunity"" because of its location at the intersection of two major Interstate highways: I-57 running from Chicago to Sikeston, Missouri, and I-70 running from Utah to Maryland. It is also served by U.S. Route 45, which runs from Ontonagon, Michigan to Mobile, Alabama, U.S. Route 40, the historic National Road, which stretches from Atlantic City, New Jersey to Summit, Utah, and Illinois routes 32 and 33 also run through the city. It is also a major railroad junction, the crossing of the Illinois Central main line from Chicago to Memphis with the Pennsylvania Railroad line from Indianapolis to St. Louis. Thus, Effingham has a broad range of restaurants, and lodging facilities.

Effingham is the home of the Effingham Flaming Hearts and the St. Anthony Bulldogs.

Geography 
Effingham is located at  (39.120903, −88.545909).

According to the 2010 census, Effingham has a total area of , of which  (or 99.39%) is land and  (or 0.61%) is water.

Demographics 

As of the 2000 United States Census, there were 12,384 people, 5,330 households, and 3,187 families residing in the city.  The population density was 1,428.9 people per square mile (551.5/km²).

The average household size was 2.25 and the average family size was 2.96.

In the city, the population was spread out with 24.9% under the age of 18, 9.0% from 18 to 24, 27.7% from 25 to 44, 20.2% from 45 to 64, and 18.1% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 89.3 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 84.2 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $34,761, and the median income for a family was $45,902. Males had a median income of $31,442 versus $21,543 for females. The per capita income for the city was $19,132.  About 6.5% of families and 9.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 12.9% of those under age 18 and 7.9% of those age 65 or over.

History 
Effingham was first settled in 1814, and was known from then until 1859 as Broughton. That year, 1859, it became the county seat with buildings relocated from nearby (now deserted) Ewington. The community was named after General E. Effingham, a local surveyor.  In the late 1880s, local citizens founded Austin College, which lasted for several decades, and ultimately was purchased to become the Illinois College of Photography, also known as Bissel College.  That school closed due to the Great Depression in the 1930s.

On April 4, 1949, St. Anthony's hospital caught fire and burned to the ground, killing 74 people.  As a result, fire codes nationwide were improved.  Due to extensive media coverage, including a ""Life Magazine"" cover story, donations for rebuilding the hospital came from all 48 states and several foreign countries.

Effingham was a sundown town; daytime segregation was enforced until at least the mid-1960s.

Rail transportation 

Effingham is also historically important as a rail junction.  The old Pennsylvania Railroad and the former Illinois Central Railroad crossed in downtown Effingham.  Even today, Amtrak's City of New Orleans passes through daily.

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Effingham under the daily City of New Orleans route to New Orleans and Chicago, Saluki, and Illini routes to Chicago and Carbondale. Until October 1, 1979, the station also served Amtrak's former National Limited line between Kansas City and New York City.

Education 
Effingham has several schools, both public and private. The private schools are both religiously affiliated and include Saint Anthony
and Sacred Heart. Saint Anthony Grade School (SAGS) serves grades preschool (age 3+) to eighth grade. SAGS has the Bullpups as its mascot. Sacred Heart Grade School (SHS) serves preschool (age 3+) to eighth grade. SHS's mascot is the Shamrocks. The public schools include the Early Learning Center, South Side Elementary, Central Grade School, Effingham Junior High School (EJHS), and Effingham High School. The Early Learning Center serves preschool and kindergarten age children. South Side Elementary serves first and second graders. Aspire, which is a school for students who are likely to drop out or those who get expelled. Central Grade School serves third through fifth grade students. Central Grade school's mascot is the mustangs. EJHS serves junior high students in grades six to eight. EJHS's mascot is the Mustangs.

Effingham High School (EHS) is the public high school. The new EHS opened in the fall of 1998, and has a current enrollment of 849. The former EHS building, built in 1939 as a WPA project (film made as of the construction) and expanded in 1965, is currently the junior high, serving grades 6–8. The old junior high, Central School, is now a grade school serving grades 3–5.  EHS athletics were originally known as the ""Warriors"" but the name was changed after Ada Kepley, a city resident, referred to Effingham as the ""Heart of America"" in a campaign to attract visitors to the city. The name stuck, with references in the city government and the downtown movie theater named ""The Heart Theater."" EHS athletics are now known as the ""Flaming Hearts"".

Effingham is also home to St. Anthony High School, a private Roman Catholic High School.  SAHS athletics are known as the ""Bulldogs"".

SHS athletics and extra-curricular activities currently consist of boys' baseball, girls' softball, girls' basketball (grades 4-8), boys' basketball (grades 4-8), girls' track (grades 5-8), boys' track (grades 5-8), girls' cross country (grade 5-8), boys' cross country (grades 5-8), volleyball, cheerleading, band (grades 5-8), chorus (grades 5-8), musicals, plays, student council, and scholar bowl.

Monument 

A  steel cross erected by The Cross Foundation is located in Effingham. The Cross is made out of over 180 tons of steel and cost over $1 million. The Cross Foundation claims that the cross is the ""largest"" in the United States standing at  with a span of . While the  Great Cross in St. Augustine, Florida is believed to be the tallest freestanding cross in the western hemisphere, it is thinner than the cross in Effingham and has a narrow span.

One resident complained that using a Christian symbol to attract tourism ""reeks of avarice and hypocrisy."" Another pointed out that the money that built the cross, which was collected through private donations, could have fed the poor and done other good for the community that wasn't simply ""over-the-top symbolism."" Philip Coats of the Cross Foundation said there was barely a ripple of criticism in the town. John Schultz, the donor who put up most of the money for the project, said, ""I guess you can't satisfy everybody.""

"Fire-Brigade: The Battle for Kiev - 1943

Fire-Brigade: The Battle for Kiev - 1943 (commonly abbreviated Fire-Brigade) is a Computer Wargame developed and published by Panther Games in Australia in 1988. The game is set around the historical WWII Eastern Front battle for Kiev in 1943.

Fire-Brigade was a pioneering computer wargame as it was one of the first wargames to take advantage of the new graphical mouse driven interfaces that 16bit computers were making available on both MAC II & IBM PC. It was also one of the first wargames to enable network game-play for head to head multiplayer battles.

Fire-Brigade required a huge amount of hard drive space and RAM for the time of its release to take full advantage of the development of 256 colours. For colour Fire-Brigade required 2MB of RAM and 640KB of hard drive space, while for mono the game only required 1MB of RAM.

Historical Synopsis 

Early November, 1943 and the war in Russia is at its height. With the capture of the strategic city of Kiev imminent, Soviet General Vatutin unleashes Rybalko's elite 3rd Guards Tank Army. ""Drive like hell"" his orders read, ""and we'll split the entire German Front!""

With the fate of the Army Group South in the balance, Marshall von Manstein must commit Balck's 48th Panzer Korps, the fire-brigade, to save the German Army. Receiving the Soviet attack will be fierce, delivering the counter-attack could be decisive... for one side or the other!

Gameplay 

Fire-Brigade is a turn-based strategic & tactical computer wargame that allows players flexibility and advanced functions. You can play either by yourself against the AI or against another person in any of four scenarios networked via modem or cable. You can play either as the Germans or the Soviet Union in any of the scenarios and you have at your command a comprehensive reporting system and realistic staff support.

Players can set combat, logistics and air commitment support values to direct the allocation of supplies; reinforcements and combat support assets. Gather intelligence on enemy forces and assess information on friendly forces before issuing movement and attack orders to units in either a micro (individual units) or macro level (subordinate headquarters). You can then set the frontage of your unit's formation to either narrow, medium or broad, all while you 'confer' with the games' AI which will use artificial intelligence routines to execute the orders within set variable parameters such as morale, troop quality, fatigue etc.

Players are given a 15 step recommended sequence of play list in the game manual for Fire-Brigade.

Reception 

Computer Gaming World called the game ""a milestone for computing wargames in terms of sophistication"" and ""Fire-Brigade is meant for the thinking man, the sophisticated player who wants to learn and make the absolute most out of his computer playing time"". A 1991 survey by the magazine of strategy and war games gave it three and a half stars out of five, and a 1993 survey of wargames gave the game two-plus stars.
The magazine gave Fire-Brigade a score of 70 out of 100 and ranked the game the 4th Top Sleeper of All Time in its November 1996 15th anniversary issue.

Fire-Brigade currently forms part of the historical collection of software; hardwere; trade and promotional materials that document the history of Apple Inc. and its contributions to the computer industry and society. This collection is currently housed at Museum Victoria, Melbourne.

Awards
Fire-Brigade won the 1988 Charles S. Roberts Award for Best 20th Century Computer Game  
Fire-Brigade won the 1989 Apple Developers Award for Best Entertainment Package

"Charles Fletcher Lummis

Charles Fletcher Lummis (March 1, 1859, in Lynn, Massachusetts – November 25, 1928, in Los Angeles, California) was a United States journalist, and an activist for Indian rights and historic preservation. A traveler in the American Southwest, he settled in Los Angeles, California, where he also became known as an historian, photographer, ethnographer, archaeologist, poet, and librarian.

Early life and career

Charles Fletcher Lummis was born in 1859, in Lynn, Massachusetts. He lost his mother at age 2 and was homeschooled by his father, who was a schoolmaster. Lummis enrolled in Harvard for college and was a classmate of Theodore Roosevelt's, but dropped out during his senior year. While at Harvard he worked during the summer as a printer and published his first work, Birch Bark Poems. This small volume was printed on paper-thin sheets of birch bark; he won acclaim from Life magazine and recognition from some of the day's leading poets. He sold the books by subscription and used the money to pay for college. A poem from this work, ""My Cigarette"", highlighted tobacco as one of his life's obsessions.

In 1880, at the age of 21, Lummis married Dorothea Rhodes of Cincinnati, Ohio.

Transcontinental walk
In 1884, Lummis was working for a newspaper in Cincinnati and was offered a job with the Los Angeles Times. At that time, Los Angeles had a population of only 12,000. Lummis decided to make the 3,507-mile journey from Cincinnati to Los Angeles on foot, taking 143 days, all the while sending weekly dispatches to the paper chronicling his trip. One of his dispatches chronicled his meeting and interview with famed outlaw Frank James. The trip began in September and lasted through the winter. Lummis suffered a broken arm and struggled in the heavy winter snows of New Mexico. He became enamored with the American Southwest, and its Spanish and Native American inhabitants. Several years later, he published his account of this journey in A Tramp Across the Continent (1892).

Editor at the Los Angeles Times
Upon his arrival, Lummis was offered the job of the first City Editor of the Los Angeles Times. He covered a multitude of interesting stories from the new and growing community. Work was hard and demanding under the pace set by publisher Harrison Gray Otis. Lummis was happy until he suffered from a mild stroke that left his left side paralyzed.

New Mexico

In 1888, Lummis moved to San Mateo, New Mexico to recuperate from his paralysis. He rode on the Plains while holding a rifle in one good hand and shooting jack rabbits. Here, he began a new career as a prolific freelance writer, writing on everything that was particularly special about the Southwest and Indian cultures. His articles about corrupt bosses committing murders in San Mateo drew threats on his life, so he moved to a new location in the Pueblo Indian village of Isleta, New Mexico, on the Rio Grande.

Indians of Isleta
Somewhat recovered from his paralysis, Lummis was able to win over the confidence of the Pueblo Indians, a Tiwa people, by his outgoing and generous nature. But a hit man from San Mateo was sent up to Isleta, where he shot Lummis but failed to kill him.

In Isleta, Lummis divorced his first wife and married Eva Douglas, who lived in the village and was the sister-in-law of an English trader. Somehow he convinced Eva to stay with Dorothea in Los Angeles until the divorce went through. In the meantime, Lummis became entangled in fights with the U.S. government agents over Indian education. In this period, the government was pushing assimilation and had established Indian boarding schools. It charged its agents with recruiting Native American children for the schools, where they were usually forced to give up traditional clothing and hair styles, and prevented from speaking their own languages or using their own customs. They were often prohibited from returning home during holidays or vacation periods, or their families were too poor to afford such travel. Lummis persuaded the government to allow 36 children from the Albuquerque Indian School to return to their homes.

While in Isleta, he made friends with Father Anton Docher from France; he was the missionary Padre of Isleta. They both also befriended Adolph Bandelier. While living in Isleta, Lummis boarded in the home of Pablo Abeita. In 1890, he traveled with Bandelier to study the indigenous people of the area.

Preservationist
As president of the Landmarks Club of Southern California (an all-volunteer, privately funded group dedicated to the preservation of California's Spanish missions), Lummis noted that the historic structures ""...were falling to ruin with frightful rapidity, their roofs being breached or gone, the adobe walls melting under the winter rains.""  Lummis wrote in 1895, ""In ten years from now—unless our intelligence shall awaken at once—""there will remain of these noble piles nothing but a few indeterminable heaps of adobe. We shall deserve and shall have the contempt of all thoughtful people if we suffer our noble missions to fall.""

Magazine editor

In 1892, Lummis published Some Strange Corners of Our Country, recounting some of the areas and sights he had discovered. Between 1893 and 1894, he spent 10 months traveling in Peru with Bandelier.

After the men's return, Lummis and Eva returned to Los Angeles with their year-old daughter, Turbese. Unemployed, Lummis landed the position of editor of a regional magazine, Land of Sunshine. The magazine was renamed Out West in 1901. He published  works by famous authors such as Jack London and John Muir. Over his 11 years as editor, Lummis also wrote more than 500 pieces for the magazine, as well as a popular monthly commentary called ""In the Lion's Den"".

Indian rights activist
Lummis also established a new Indian rights group called the "" Sequoya League"", after the noted early 19th-century Cherokee leader Sequoyah who developed a written alphabet for the language. Lummis fought against the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and called on his classmate President Teddy Roosevelt to help change their manner of operating. He found a home for a small group of Indians who had been evicted from their property in the Palm Springs, California area. The Sequoya League began a battle against Indian Agent Charles Burton, accusing him of imposing a ""reign of terror"" on the Hopi pueblo in Oraibi by requiring Hopi men to cut their long hair. It was their custom to wear it long, a practice with spiritual meaning. Lummis was accused of overstating the case against Burton and lost his welcome at the White House. (However, subsequent social pressure on Burton led him to reverse the haircutting policy.)

Later life
In 1905, Lummis took the position as City Librarian of the Los Angeles Public Library.  Lummis replaced Mary Jones as City Librarian even though he had no prior library training. He was criticized for the way he ran the library and insisted on doing most of the work at home.  He resigned from that sole source of income in 1911, while he worked to start up the Southwest Museum while engaged in a bitter and public divorce with his wife Eva.  

In that year Lummis went blind, which he attributed to a ""jungle fever"" contracted while in Guatemala exploring the Mayan ruins of Quiriguá.  After more than a year of blindness, during which he might appear in public with his eyes covered by a bandanna or wearing dark amber glasses, he regained his sight.  Some privately doubted Lummis actually went blind; among them was John Muir, who said so in a letter to him and encouraged him to get more rest.

In 1915, Lummis married his third wife, Gertrude, at El Alisal.

By 1918, he was destitute. In 1923, the Southwest Museum Board named him founder emeritus and gave him a small stipend. In 1925, Lummis also decided to enlarge, revise, and republish Some Strange Corners of Our Country as Mesa, Canyon and Pueblo. He also engaged in a renewed civil rights crusade on behalf of the Pueblo Indians.

Death
Lummis died November 25, 1928.  He was cremated, and his ashes were placed in a vault in a wall at El Alisal. Supporters bought his home El Alisal, which is now used as the headquarters of the Historical Society of Southern California.

Legacy and honors

Lummis' cultural influence remains today, including a lasting imprint on the Mount Washington neighborhood of Los Angeles.  The home he built, The Lummis House, and the museum he founded, The Southwest Museum, are located within 0.7 miles of each other and remain open to the public for limited hours on weekends.

El Alisal (Lummis House) 

Lummis purchased a 3 acre plot around 1895 and spent 13 years building what would become a 4,000-square-foot stone home with an exhibition hall, calling it El Alisal. He frequently entertained, with parties he called ""noises"" for various writers, artists,
and other prominent figures.  The parties usually included a lavish Spanish dinner with dancing and music performed by his own private troubadour. The extravaganzas wore out a number of female assistants or ""secretaries"" conscripted into working on them.

The Lummis House was  donated to the Southwest Museum in 1910 and then sold in 1943 to the state of California, which transferred it to the city in 1971. The Historical Society of Southern California took occupancy in 1965, using it as headquarters and helping manage the property, eventually leaving in 2014. Open to the public as a museum and park on Saturdays and Sundays, the site also serves as a focus for Lummis Day activities (see below).

Southwest Museum
By 1907, Lummis had founded the Southwest Museum of Los Angeles, California.  He had led the fundraising campaign to build a new structure for it and saw the building open in August 1914..

The Southwest Museum operated independently until 2003, when it was merged into the Autry Museum of the American West. The Autry launched a multi-year conservation project to preserve the enormous collection amassed by Lummis and his successors. Much of the material was moved off-site, but The Southwest Museum has maintained an ongoing public exhibit on Pueblo pottery that is free of charge and open on Saturdays only.

Lummis Day Festival
Beginning in 2006, the annual Lummis Day Festival was established by the Lummis Day Community Foundation. It holds the festival in Lummis' honor on the first Sunday in June, drawing people to El Alisal and Heritage Square Museum for poetry readings, art exhibits, music, dance performances, and family activities.  The foundation is a non-profit organization of community activists and arts organization leaders.

"Black Night

""Black Night"" is a song by British hard rock band Deep Purple, first released as a single in June 1970 and later included on the 25th Anniversary version of their 1970 album, In Rock. The song became a hit following its release, peaking at No. 2 on UK charts, and to this day remains Deep Purple's highest charting UK single. It topped the charts in Switzerland, and is one of only two singles from the band to chart in Ireland, peaking at No. 4, thus making it the group's only Irish Top 10 hit. It was also the second non-album single penned by the band and also reached number 6 in South Africa.

Writing process and recording
Once In Rock had been completed, EMI asked for a suitable single to be recorded to help promote the album. Though Roger Glover states that Ricky Nelson's 1962 hard rocking arrangement of the George Gershwin song ""Summertime"" was the basis for the Mk II Deep Purple single ""Black Night"", it is also similar to Blues Magoos's 1966 psychedelic hit song ""(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet"". In the BBC documentary Heavy Metal Britannia, keyboardist Jon Lord supports Glover's statement about the song's origin, stating ""Black Night was nicked from the bass line in Ricky Nelson's Summertime"" and then proceeds to play the bassline riff on his grand piano.

Live performances
""Black Night"" made its way into the setlist soon after release, generally as the first encore.  The song was not played in full after Ian Gillan and Roger Glover left the band in 1973, but snippets were often played by Ritchie Blackmore as part of his improvisations.  On the reformation of Deep Purple in 1984 ""Black Night"" returned as part of the main set list. There are many versions of the song available on Deep Purple live albums.

Personnel
Ian Gillan – vocals
Ritchie Blackmore – guitar
Roger Glover – bass
Jon Lord – organ
Ian Paice – drums

Covers

In 1982, Los Angeles female-fronted metal band Hellion recorded this song as the B-side of their ""Driving Hard"" single, which was released on Mystic Records in early 1983. 
In 1982, post-punk group The Fall took to performing a medley integrating the song into their own composition ""Cash 'n' Carry""; a recording of this was belatedly issued in 2002 on a reissue of Fall in a Hole. 
Metallica played the intro during the encore of their shows in 1989.
Bruce Dickinson - B side of single: ""Dive, Dive, Dive"", recorded live in 1990. He and his band would perform it live during the Tattooed Millionaire tour.
The main riff of the song is used to end Australian alternative rock band TISM's song ""Get Thee in My Behind, Satan"", from their 1990 album Hot Dogma.
In 1991, Vic Reeves covered the song on I Will Cure You album. 
Bad Manners - ska version on their 1997 album Heavy Petting.
CJ Crew also covered this song for the Dancemania compilation series, but has a heavier sound to it. 
A version also appears on 2005 Live DVD, Castles and Dreams by Blackmore's Night.
Pat Travers has recorded a version on his album P.T. Power Trio 2 in 2006. 
The song is also recorded by the American death metal band Deicide on their 2006 album, The Stench of Redemption, though with rewritten lyrics. 
In 2007, Finnish power metal band Twilight Guardians covered the song for their fourth and last album, Ghost Reborn, as a Japanese bonus track.

In addition, the song is played at the beginning of the French Movie Les Lyonnais (Which is known in English as  A Gang Story ).

"Holly

Ilex , or holly, is a  genus of about 480 species of flowering plants in the family Aquifoliaceae, and the only living genus in that family. The species are evergreen or deciduous trees, shrubs, and climbers from tropics to temperate zones worldwide.

Description

The genus Ilex includes about 480 species,  divided into three subgenera:
 Ilex subg. Byronia, with the type species Ilex polypyrena
 Ilex subg. Prinos, with 12 species
 Ilex subg. Ilex, with the rest of the species

The genus is widespread throughout the temperate and subtropical regions of the world. It includes species of trees, shrubs, and climbers, with evergreen or deciduous foliage and inconspicuous flowers. Its range was more extended in the Tertiary period and many species are adapted to laurel forest habitats. It occurs from sea level to more than  with high mountain species. It is a genus of small, evergreen trees with smooth, glabrous, or pubescent branchlets. The plants are generally slow-growing with some species growing to  tall. The type species is the European holly Ilex aquifolium described by Linnaeus.

Plants in this genus have simple, alternate glossy leaves, frequently with a spiny leaf margin. The inconspicuous flower is greenish white, with four petals. They are generally dioecious, with male and female flowers on different plants.

The small fruits of Ilex, although often referred to as berries, are technically drupes. They range in color from red to brown to black, and rarely green or yellow. The ""bones"" contain up to ten seeds each.  Some species produce fruits parthenogenetically, such as the cultivar 'Nellie R. Stevens'. The fruits ripen in winter and thus provide winter colour contrast between the bright red of the fruits and the glossy green evergreen leaves.  Hence the cut branches, especially of I. aquifolium, are widely used in Christmas decoration. The fruits are generally slightly toxic to humans, and can cause vomiting and diarrhea when ingested. However, they are an important food source for birds and other animals, which help disperse the seeds.  Unfortunately this can have negative impacts as well.  Along the west coast of North America, from California to British Columbia, English holly (Ilex aquifolium), which is grown commercially, is quickly spreading into native forest habitat, where it thrives in shade and crowds out native species.  It has been placed on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board's monitor list, and is a Class C invasive plant in Portland.

Etymology
Ilex in Latin means the holm-oak or evergreen oak (Quercus ilex).  Despite the Linnaean classification of Ilex as holly, as late as the 19th century in Britain, the term Ilex was still being applied to the oak as well as the holly – possibly due to the superficial similarity of the leaves.  The name ""holly"" in common speech refers to Ilex aquifolium, specifically stems with berries used in Christmas decoration.  By extension, ""holly"" is also applied to the whole genus. The origin of the word ""holly"" is considered a reduced form of Old English , Middle English Holin, later Hollen.

The French word for holly, , derives from the Old Low Franconian *hulis (Middle Dutch huls). Both are related to Old High German , huls, as are Low German/Low Franconian terms like  or . These Germanic words appear to be related to words for holly in Celtic languages, such as Welsh , Breton  and Irish .

Several Romance languages use the Latin word acrifolium, literally ""sharp leaf"" (turned into aquifolium in modern time), so Italian , Occitan , etc.

History

The phylogeography of this group provides examples of various speciation mechanisms at work. In this scenario ancestors of this group became isolated from the remaining Ilex when the Earth mass broke away into Gondwana and Laurasia about 82million years ago, resulting in a physical separation of the groups and beginning a process of change to adapt to new conditions. This mechanism is called allopatric speciation. Over time, survivor species of the holly genus adapted to different ecological niches. This led to reproductive isolation, an example of ecological speciation. In the Pliocene, around five million years ago, mountain formation diversified the landscape and provided new opportunities for speciation within the genus.

The fossil record indicates that the Ilex lineage was already widespread prior to the end of the Cretaceous period. Based on the molecular clock, the common ancestor of most of the extant species probably appeared during the Eocene, about 50million years ago, suggesting that older representatives of the genus belong to now extinct branches. The laurel forest covered great areas of the Earth during the Paleogene, when the genus was more prosperous. This type of forest extended during the Neogene, more than 20million years ago. Most of the last remaining temperate broadleaf evergreen forests are believed to have disappeared about 10,000 years ago at the end of the Pleistocene. Many of the then-existing species with the strictest ecological requirements became extinct because they could not cross the barriers imposed by the geography, but others found refuge as a species relict in coastal enclaves, archipelagos, and coastal mountains sufficiently far from areas of extreme cold and aridity and protected by the oceanic influence.

Range
The genus is distributed throughout the world's different climates. Most species make their home in the tropics and subtropics, with a worldwide distribution in temperate zones. The greatest diversity of species is found in the Americas and in Southeast Asia.

Ilex mucronata, formerly the type species of Nemopanthus, is native to eastern North America. Nemopanthus was treated as a separate genus with eight species. of the family Aquifoliaceae, now transferred to Ilex on molecular data; it is closely related to Ilex amelanchier.

In Europe the genus is represented by a single species, the classically named holly Ilex aquifolium, and in continental Africa by this species and (Ilex mitis). Ilex canariensis, from Macaronesia, and Ilex aquifolium arose from a common ancestor in the laurel forests of the Mediterranean. Australia, isolated at an early period, has (Ilex arnhemensis). Of 204 species growing in China, 149 species are endemic. A species which stands out for its economic importance in Spanish-speaking countries and in Brazil is Ilex paraguariensis or Yerba mate. Having evolved numerous species that are endemic to islands and small mountain ranges, and being highly useful plants, many hollies are now becoming rare.

Ecology
Often the tropical species are especially threatened by habitat destruction and overexploitation. At least two species of Ilex have become extinct recently, and many others are barely surviving.

They are extremely important food for numerous species of birds, and also are eaten by other wild animals. In the autumn and early winter the fruits are hard and apparently unpalatable. After being frozen or frosted several times, the fruits soften, and become milder in taste. During winter storms, birds often take refuge in hollies, which provide shelter, protection from predators (by the spiny leaves), and food. The flowers are sometimes eaten by the larva of the double-striped pug moth (Gymnoscelis rufifasciata). Other Lepidoptera whose larvae feed on holly include Bucculatrix ilecella, which feeds exclusively on hollies, and the engrailed (Ectropis crepuscularia).

Toxicity
Holly can contain caffeic acid, caffeoyl derivatives, caffeoylshikimic acid, chlorogenic acid, feruloylquinic acid, quercetin, quinic acid, kaempferol, tannins, rutin,  caffeine, and theobromine.

Holly berries can cause vomiting and diarrhea.  They are especially dangerous in cases involving accidental consumption by children attracted to the bright red berries.   Ingestion of over 20 berries may be fatal to children.

Holly leaves, if eaten, might cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomach and intestinal problems.

Holly plants might be toxic to pets and livestock.

Uses

Culinary use
Leaves of some holly species are used by some cultures to make daily tea. These species are Yerba mate (I. paraguariensis), Ilex guayusa, Kuding (Ilex kaushue),  Yaupon (I. vomitoria) and others. Leaves of other species, such as gallberry (I. glabra) are bitter and emetic.  In general little is known about inter-species variation in constituents or toxicity of hollies.

Ornamental use
Many of the holly species are widely used as ornamental plants in temperate/European gardens and parks, notably:
 I. aquifolium (common European holly)
 I. crenata (box-leaved holly)
 I. verticillata (winterberry)
Moreover, many hundreds of hybrids and cultivars have been developed for garden use, among them the very popular ""Highclere holly"", Ilex × altaclerensis (I. aquifolium × I. perado) and the ""blue holly"", Ilex × meserveae (I. aquifolium × I. rugosa). The cultivar I. × meserveae Blue Prince = ‘Conablu’ has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.  Hollies are often used  for hedges; the spiny leaves make them difficult to penetrate, and they take well to pruning and shaping.

Culture

Holly – more specifically the European holly, Ilex aquifolium – is commonly referenced at Christmas time, and is often referred to by the name Christ's thorn. In many Western Christian cultures, holly is a traditional Christmas decoration, used especially in wreaths and illustrations, for instance on Christmas cards. Since medieval times the plant has carried a Christian symbolism, as expressed in the well-known Christian Christmas carol ""The Holly and the Ivy"", in which the holly represents Jesus and the ivy represents the Virgin Mary. Angie Mostellar discusses the Christian use of holly at Christmas, stating that:

In heraldry, holly is used to symbolize truth. The Norwegian municipality of Stord has a yellow twig of holly in its Coat-of-arms.

The Druids held that ""leaves of holly offered protection against evil spirits"" and thus ""wore holly in their hair"".

In the Harry Potter novels, holly is used as the wood in Harry's wand.

In some traditions of Wicca, the Holly King is one of the faces of the Sun God. He is born at midsummer and rules from Mabon to Ostara.

Robert Goolrick (born 1948 in Virginia) is an American writer whose first novel sold more than five million copies..

Biography 
Robert Goolrick grew up in the 1950s in the small college town of Lexington, Virginia. His father was a college professor. His mother was a homemaker, and he had two siblings. When Goolrick lost his job as an advertising copywriter, he turned to memoir writing. He wrote a memoir and his parents disinherited him, so he moved to New York. The End of the World As We Know It: Scenes from a Life highlighted ""the excesses and failures of both the social underpinnings of the time and his parents' inevitable alcohol-fueled decline, culminating in a devastating portrayal of the sexual abuse he suffered as a child."" He sought ""something resembling peace"" in his writing. After years living in New York City, he returned to Virginia. In 2015 he moved from Whitestone, Virginia to Weems, Virginia. He reads from his book ""A Reliable Wife"" in a video posted for his Facebook followers to which he added, ""For people who can't come to a bookstore, this is what I look like and what I sound like, thanks to my friend Ashraf Meer.""

"Seven Ages of Rock

Seven Ages of Rock (also known as 7 Ages of Rock) is a BBC Two series, co-produced by BBC Worldwide and VH1 Classic in 2007 about the history of rock music.

It comprised six 60-minute episodes (reduced to 48 minutes for VH1 Classic), with a final episode of 90 minutes, and was broadcast on Saturdays at 21:00 (repeated on BBC One on Sundays). Each episode focused on one type of rock music, each typified by one or two artists or bands. The series producer was William Naylor, and the executive producer for the BBC was Michael Poole, a former editor of the 1990s BBC music, arts and culture programme The Late Show. The production was based at BBC Bristol and each programme was narrated by Julian Rhind-Tutt on the BBC and Dennis Hopper on VH1 classic.

The series also included additional material broadcast on BBC radio and available on the BBC website.

Series structure
The series makes heavy use of archive material. These early performances of musicians are interspersed with interviews with various other musicians. Naylor could use interviews from various other music series he had made for the BBC, such as with David Bowie, who was not available for an interview this time.

In an interview about the series, Naylor says that he has noticed the time is ripe for a revival of rock because he sees a growing popularity of slightly uncomfortable music and a somewhat arrogant attitude, precisely what rock needs. He also claims the series finally says what needed to be said, that England made Jimi Hendrix. He even states that rock music started on 24 September 1966 in London, when Jimi Hendrix went there.

The series did receive some criticism from the press as it ignored rock and roll's contribution to the birth of rock. Neil McCormick, music critic for The Daily Telegraph (who appeared in one of the episodes as an interviewee) said: ""...popular music only really gelled into what we now know as rock when Hendrix arrived in London in 1966.""'.

Episodes

Programme 1: The Birth of Rock

Jimi Hendrix grew up in Seattle in the 1950s, learning the Twelve-bar blues as a teenager. Whilst in the army he came under the influence of the electric blues of artists such as Howlin' Wolf, B.B. King and Muddy Waters. After he was discharged in 1962 he became involved in the Chitlin' Circuit, playing with figures such as Little Richard.

Former Animals member, Eric Burdon, says Hendrix could not get off the ground in the US because black blues was not popular there. Meanwhile, the English music scene was learning to play the blues from the US records they bought, with bands forming like The Rolling Stones, who began by copying American blues numbers. When they started to write their own songs they gave them a sexual swagger and a new direction. Whites playing the blues made it more acceptable to the white US audience reintroducing the style to America. When Hendrix moved to New York City he came under the influence of British blues music, especially that of Jeff Beck of the Yardbirds and Eric Clapton, who had become famous with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. While living in Harlem he also came under the influence of Bob Dylan, whose ""Like a Rolling Stone"" revolutionised rock. For Hendrix this inspired him to begin singing, having previously been self-conscious about his voice. Another English band, The Who, inspired him most. With a roughness and a high octane sound, they created the modern stage presence with the theatrics of destroying their equipment, such as playing the guitar by ramming it against the floor and speakers.

Jimi Hendrix came to London in late 1966 after having been discovered and invited by his future manager Chas Chandler of The Animals, on the sole condition that he would be introduced to his guitar heroes. He arrived at the height of swinging London with Cream being the most important band around. At one of their concerts, Hendrix asked if he could join in a jam. That was already audacious, playing with 'God', but then he blew Clapton away, who went back stage and had a hard time lighting a cigarette because his hands were shaking too much. Stealing Cream's thunder, Chandler put together The Jimi Hendrix Experience, who became famous faster than almost any other rock band.

However, despite his UK success, Hendrix was still largely ignored in his home country. This was to change when he played the Monterey Pop Festival at the height of The Summer of Love. The Who played first, with an aggression never before seen in the U.S.A. Hendrix stunned the crowds further with his explosive sound and showmanship culminating in setting fire to his guitar.

In 1966, The Beatles had taken refuge in the studio, transforming themselves from a pop band to psychedelic pioneers. When Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band was released in 1967, Hendrix covered it on one of the experience's next shows. Having seen the power of the studio album he went on to create Electric Ladyland. However, it led to Hendrix becoming more deeply involved in drugs and Chas Chandler leaving as manager.

By 1968, America and Europe were being torn apart by conflict at home and abroad. The Rolling Stones tapped into these feelings with a new creative zeal. However, their performance at Altamont became one of the most violent days in rock history, after a member of Hells Angels killed Meredith Hunter, a drugged member of the audience, who drew a revolver from his jacket during the Stones' set. The Altamont festival was meant to mirror the Woodstock Festival, where Hendrix delivered a searing version of the Star-Spangled Banner, which many saw as a political statement against the Vietnam War. However, Hendrix began to tire of stage performance and at the Isle of Wight festival in 1970 he gave a lacklustre performance. In September he died of an accidental overdose. Along with the deaths of Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin and the breaking up of The Beatles, this brought this age of rock to a close.

Alternative Programme 1: My Generation
The broadcast of the VH1 episode is very differently structured and features several different songs, interviews, and artists, as well as the main focus, Jimi Hendrix, being completely removed and the new focus being the Rolling Stones. This is not an issue with other episodes which are only mildly different.

In the early 1960s the music for teenagers was sweet and soulless, manufactured pop with a beat for crooners such as Bobby Vinton and Bobby Vee. The music of blues singers such as John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf was powerful and rebellious and had come out of struggle in a way that spoke to the British Working Class, who were not politically constrained as they were in white America.

In 1962, The Rolling Stones formed and started playing in the Crawdaddy Club in Richmond. Their Blues with a British twist proved a hit with teenage audiences. The Rolling Stones began creating their own songs with lyrics loaded with arrogance and sex. Their space at the Crawdaddy club was taken by The Yardbirds, who attempted to produce their own twist on the blues, helped by their guitarist Eric Clapton, who was considered by some to be so proficient with the guitar that he garnered the popular nickname ""God"". However, he split from the Yardbirds after their commercial success to become a serious blues musician.

A new wave of British bands were now emerging. The Kinks produced an electrified gritty sound expanding musical possibilities. Inspired by them, The Who combined a macho image, pop art and fast driven rock. In 1965, year zero of rock, the Who released a song that the program postulates defined the era, ""My Generation"", and was incredibly innovative in both its sound and rebellious message.

The Animals had first opened the path for these bands with the reimagining of ""the House of the Rising Sun"", which they came across when it was covered by Bob Dylan from the New York City folk scene. He now took inspiration from these new British bands by going electric to produce ""the Wild Thin Mercury sound of Rock Music"", which added sophisticated lyrics to rock.

Back in Britain, Eric Clapton had found creative freedom in his own band Cream, which were much more musically skilled than most other groups at the time. They took the language and feel of the blues producing the 'endless-solo'. Disraeli Gears took the blues and combined it with the drug-filled psychedelia, showing the artistic potential of rock.

When The Who went to the Monterey Pop Festival, they innovated the live performance by channelling aggression, playing at high volume and destroying their instruments. This established the festival as the centre of the rock performance but also signalled the end of the innocent optimism of the summer of love. Anxieties over the Vietnam war and social unrest rising and, after the Woodstock Festival, business started to take over what artists were doing. This new mood was channelled by the Rolling Stones using darkness as a new creative zeal. However, they were plunged into their own darkness with the death of Brian Jones and the chaos of Altamont, where, according to Al Kooper, the innocence of the Sixties finally died.

The Beatles are not mentioned throughout the episode.

Many of this episode's featured songs are completely different, and so they are listed separately here:

Programme 2: ""White Light, White Heat""

In 1967, Pink Floyd published ""Arnold Layne"", a song about a clothes-stealing transvestite, introducing a new concept in pop music, psychedelia. Like Andy Warhol did with The Velvet Underground in the US, they turned their shows into multimedia spectacles. Warhol came up with the idea of projecting films on the background of the stage. With Peter Jenner seeing Pink Floyd as the English version of the Velvet Underground, they decided to use this medium to illustrate the songs they were singing, projecting what effectively were the first music clips on a large screen behind the band. The shows grew ever more weird, and others followed. David Bowie was inspired by the weirdness of Velvet Underground and the madness of Pink Floyd's Syd Barrett (as exemplified by his Jugband Blues). Bowie created an alter-ego named Ziggy Stardust, which gave him an excuse to dress up on stage. Genesis' Peter Gabriel took Bowie's stage act even further dressing in even
more elaborate and bizarre costumes; ""Compared to what Gabriel wore on stage, Bowie was dressed for a night at the pub.""

Another new thing in rock music was experimenting with sounds. Roxy Music introduced an oboe to rock. And when Pink Floyd wondered what a piano would sound like through a Leslie speaker, they came up with the intro to Echoes, a piece that lasted the entire second side of the album Meddle. The stage performances of songs could also last much longer than the album versions. The performances grew so large that Pink Floyd felt ever more alienated from the audience and decided to 'protest' against that by putting up such a large performance with huge puppets for the stage show of The Wall that the band became almost invisible. During the show they built up a wall on stage between themselves and the audience making them literally invisible. This performance lasted only four shows and marked the end of this age of rock.

In the VH1 version of this episode, David Bowie's early influences are discussed in less detail, there is no discussion of Bowie and Roxy Music playing the Rainbow theatre and Hang On To Yourself- David Bowie, Ladytron and Re-make Remodel are not featured with the section on Roxy Music being much smaller and Supper's Ready- Genesis is played but not discussed except in relation to costumes.

In this episode some of the featured songs on the BBC website were not the same as featured in the episode as The Velvet Underground - Venus In Furs is replaced by The Velvet Underground - All Tomorrow's Parties.

Programme 3: Blank Generation

""In 1975, New York City was near bankruptcy and no fun at all. London was not much better. In this tale of two cities, from the worst of times came the best of times: punk rock."" Punk went back to the roots. If people saw a show they should get the feeling that they could do that themselves; that is what rock & roll is all about. Punk was DIY; the bands invented themselves, and the punkers made their own clothes.

The Ramones sang about the street life experiences of kids in Queens. The Sex Pistols started with covers of mod classics by The Who, but of course, they soon went DIY too in that respect, although that did not prevent Glen Matlock from letting ABBA's ""SOS"" inspire him for the guitar riff in ""Pretty Vacant"".

Punk was class rage. According to Charles Shaar Murray, ""The New York punks were bohemians or aspired to be, and the London punks were yobs or aspired to be."" According to Sex Pistol John Lydon, the indignation was not put on; ""We suffer, and you can fuck off for it!""

Punk was about doing new things, and punk girl bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Slits were new in a new way; Viv Albertine said ""We wanted to do our own girlie whalloping thing, and punk was open enough for us to do that."" And Patti Smith was not only about music, but about language too, almost like a freestyle rapper; ""Spitting out something that goes right into your head.""

When the Sex Pistols went to the US, they wanted to show them what punk was really about, but instead it destroyed them. They had no fun, so they decided to take that to the extreme in their last show in San Francisco in 1978, playing a typically raucous show, and ending (as an Encore) with a cover of The Stooges song 'No Fun'. Before going off stage, John Lydon remarked ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?"" Lydon later commented: ""That was directed to the whole world, including us."" After leaving, Lydon started Public Image Ltd, and ushered in the post-punk era.

In this episode some of the featured songs on the BBC website were not the same as featured in the episode. These include the episode not opening with Iggy and the Stooges' ""No Fun"" but the Sex Pistols' version (although is not named until the end of the episode), the Buzzcocks also played ""Boredom"" and ""Ever Fallen in Love""; The Slits only featuring one song, ""Typical Girls,"" rather than the three featured on the website; and Public Image's ""Poptones"" appearing in the episode.

The VH1 broadcast was substantially different from the BBC. No discussion was made of the Sex Pistols' interview with Bill Grundy and the press coverage. Also there was no mention of The Buzzcocks, Tommy James talking about ""New Rose"", the Punk girl bands or Public Image Limited, instead the episode playing out to ""London Calling"" by the Clash.

Programme 4: Never Say Die

Heavy metal is the music critics love to hate, but also the longest lasting mainstay of rock music. More than any other band at the time, Black Sabbath were influenced by their surroundings, heavily industrialised Birmingham. This was even more true for guitarist Tony Iommi, who cut off the tips of two fingers in a steel factory. When he tried to solve this problem by melting a washing up liquid bottle, and forming two 'thimbles' for his fingers, he found that by tuning his guitar down three semitones (to C#), he could play just as easily, and also get a very different, altogether much darker sound (although this was not used until their third album). Another inspiration for the band came from the movie theatre across the street. Sabbath decided that if people were eager to pay money to be scared, then maybe they should play scary music.

In 1971, when Deep Purple were in Montreux to record the album Machine Head, they were themselves scared by a fire in the casino when ""some stupid with a flare gun burned the place to the ground"" during a concert by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. Since their recording studio was also in the casino, they decided to make the album in their hotel. On the last day they needed to record one more song and decided to simply tell the story of their recording session, which became the lyrics to Smoke on the Water.

By the end of the 1980s, Metal had become too commercial for some fans, with groups like the W.A.S.P., Hanoi Rocks and Poison having huge success. Influenced by the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, another new sound had risen to prominence in the US, where metal had a huge following: thrash metal, a style that went beyond in many respects, being faster and heavier than anything that had come before. But playing the guitar ever faster had reached a ceiling and at the turn of the decade, Metallica, one of the inventors of thrash, decided to turn that around and adopt a very slow, heavy, sound. The result was 'The Black Album' which went on to sell over 15 million copies and ""proved that metal, never in fashion, but never out of fashion, will always just keep on going"".

The VH1 broadcast was different from the BBC. No discussion was made of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath being recorded or played. Breaking the Law did not feature and nothing was discussed about punk. After the death of Randy Rhoads instead of playing I Don't Know from Live in Salt Lake City it features Shot In The Dark, there is also no mention Ozzy Osbourne's off stage antics such as decapitating birds and bats or urinating on the Alamo.

Programme 5: We Are the Champions

One of the first big bands of stadium rock was Led Zeppelin, who played to audiences of 50,000. They were so successful that they could take 90% of the revenue, leaving only 10% for the promoters, who were used to taking the largest slice of the pie. But in the case of Led Zeppelin even 10% was worth their while. Queen took this even further and played for audiences of 130.000, filling big stadiums. This was in part due to the act they put on. In the US, Kiss took that even further, ignoring the music and focusing purely on the act. They made their money largely from merchandise, which was bought by children who knew nothing of Rock and Roll and the merchandise alone gave them a revenue of 50 million dollars per year. In the US, Bruce Springsteen also became one of the icons of stadium rock, almost against his own will. He kept playing clubs when he could have been playing theatres and he kept playing theatres when he could have been playing stadiums. But ironically, it was exactly this 'regular guy' attitude that made him popular.

When The Police had made it in England, they first financed their own tour of the US (where for a while they became the biggest band) and then started going to countries where few other western bands had gone before. Queen did something similar by touring South America and filling huge football stadiums. In Japan they were received as warmly as The Beatles. This was all topped by Live Aid, which was heard by a third of the world population. Bob Geldof: ""It turned out the lingua franca of the world was not English, but Rock and Roll.""

U2 was the last great band to emerge from stadium rock. Zoo TV brought the TV on stage. And they introduced another new phenomenon, the B-stage, in the middle of the audience, where they were totally surrounded by them, thus reversing the ongoing development of the bands getting ever further separated from their audiences.

The VH1 version of this episode did not mention Peter Grant or 90/10 deal with concert promoters, the ""designer bands"" of Aerosmith, Guns N' Roses, and Bon Jovi, nor having any of them playing. It did not show Queen playing Hyde Park and did not have them playing Another One Bites the Dust or I Want To Break Free, with no discussion on the politics of playing in South America. The discussion of the Police is reduced and Walking on the Moon is not played. The Angel of Harlem is also not featured.

Programme 6: Left of the Dial

""Seattle, Washington, USA. In the early 1990s the music capital of the world. Home to grunge, teen spirit and the kings of alternative rock, Nirvana, the band that brought the sound of the American underground to a mass audience."" Alternative rock was a reaction to the shock treatment of Reaganomics, leading to Generation X, that couldn't identify with the studio-polished rock that filled mainstream radio and MTV. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic were part of this generation and inspired by groups such as Black Flag, who played a more fitting musical style, hardcore punk. Alternative rock was in the early 1980s called college rock because it was mostly played by campus radio stations, who broadcast in the lower bandwidths that were not shown on the dials of radios, so listeners had to turn the knob 'left of the dial'. These were also forced to tour constantly and play in small venues with groups such as The Replacements and Sonic Youth.

The founding band of alternative rock, R.E.M., toured non-stop from 5 April 1980 to the end of 1989, so they laid down their guitars and Peter Buck picked up a mandolin, resulting in the song ""Losing My Religion"", that would be the start of the sound that gave them worldwide fame. Nirvana experienced a similar change, starting with Cobain's song ""About a Girl"", which he was unsure about because it was so 'poppy'. Another inspiration for their new sound was the way they started every recording session, taking half an hour for a free-style jam, in which they experimented with how soft or how loud they could play. Cobain liked the contrast and had always wondered what it would sound like if one mixed Black Sabbath with The Beatles. He dreamed of noise and melody, hard guitars and harmonies. Nirvana created a sound that blended the fury of grunge with a new feel for melody and the mass commercial appeal of R.E.M., leading to what would become alternative rock's anthem, ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"". There were some reservations about the song because it sounded like a Pixies rip-off, a band that had been playing exactly that dynamic mix of soft and loud music. Thanks to the success of Nirvana, R.E.M. and Mudhoney, Alternative Rock and Grunge went mainstream and record companies bought up as many of these small bands as possible, leading to the commercial success of groups such as Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, The Smashing Pumpkins and Pearl Jam.

Nirvana put Seattle on the map, so REM went there too. There was even talk of the two bands performing together; however, Kurt Cobain's untimely death prevented this collaboration from happening. Cobain admired R.E.M., as they had achieved everything without compromise, while he had become part of the machine he despised. After he had already become rich, he still bought clothes in Salvation Army stores. Fans knew this, so there would be some 80 of them waiting at the store, just to watch what clothes he would buy, even cracking the window as they peeked in. Some can handle that sort of attention, some can't. Kurt couldn't. He joked about naming their new album I Hate Myself And I Want To Die (instead it would be called In Utero). Five months after Nirvana's famous unplugged session, in April 1994, he killed himself, despite efforts by R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe to get him back on his feet again. Cobain's suicide note read the words of Neil Young ""It's better to burn out than to fade away"".

In the VH1 version of this episode, It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine) - R.E.M. does not feature and instead opens to Here Comes A Regular - The Replacements (although unnamed), Hüsker Dü do not feature and are not mentioned, instead Sonic Youth's Goo album is mentioned and shown in relation to their signing to a mainstream label. Pearl Jam are discussed in slightly more detail, Something In The Way and Come As You Are by Nirvana are not featured and the discussion of Unplugged is reduced, only being featured in relation to Cobain's suicide.

Programme 7: What the World Is Waiting For

The British Indie scene flourished in Manchester in the early 1980s. Manchester was transformed by The Smiths, through Morrissey's lyrics into a place of epic romance as part of a critique of the hard northern working class life under Thatcher. The Indie scene was diverse and contained bands such as The Cocteau Twins, The Fall and The Jesus and Mary Chain. By 1986, The Smiths had become one of Britain's most established band's, a record deal with label EMI had been agreed and they began to play larger and larger venues in the U.S. However, this brought its own pressures and eventually this contributed to The Smiths splitting in the summer of 1987.

This split coincided with the rise of house music and the development of a new wave of indie bands giving the music ""a psychedelic twist"". The Stone Roses, combined indie, house and a ""west-coast"" psychedelic feel, with rhythms at the forefront of the music and instrumentals crossing into the world of dance. In 1989, they played The Empress Ballroom in Blackpool, popularising the new scene and led to the media spotlight falling on ""Madchester"", containing groups such as Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets. Blur were made to put out a record based around the Madchester sound; this was not the band's own sound, however, but their record company's wishes.

In the summer of 1993 Oasis signed to Creation Records and began gigging up and down the country, then moving to London once they had an established fan base. This was perfectly timed as the centre of Indie music had moved from Manchester to London due mainly to the influence of Suede. Suede had an image around dark glamour and sexual ambiguity, being declared the leaders of Britpop. This section is where reductive shades into absurd. Blur's second and third albums truly launched Britpop, going to the top of the album charts crossing them to mainstream, this was soon followed by Oasis’ debut, creating a scene encompassing groups from Pulp to Elastica. In August 1995, Blur and Oasis had a sales battle for the number one spot with Blur getting to number one just. However, Oasis’ (What's the Story) Morning Glory? became one of the biggest selling albums of all time, with them being called the ""Voice of a generation"". They sold out football stadiums and indoor arenas making it hard for them to find venues. In early 1996, they organised a festival at Knebworth for 250,000 people to which one in 20 people in the UK applied for tickets. However, this was as big as Indie music was going to get, as many felt they could no longer be truly called Indie.

The Libertines attempted to bring Indie music back down to earth. Like The Smiths before them, their concerts focused around direct interaction between band and audience. They also held spontaneous guerrilla gigs at fans homes and pioneered the use of the internet for bands. However, when Doherty's drug habit spun out of control, creating tension in the band, it eventually lead to their split in 2005. Many new guitar bands have risen to prominence in recent years, such as Franz Ferdinand and Kaiser Chiefs, with some, such as Arctic Monkeys, displaying their influence from the Libertines.

The broadcast of the VH1 episode is different from the original broadcast. The discussion of the Smiths is very reduced only mentioning their Top of the Pops performance, the closeness to the Audience and their breakup and not featuring 'Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now'. There is also no mention of Indie bands from the 1980s other than the Smiths and the Stone Roses. There is no discussion or featuring of Live Forever. The section on Blur is very reduced, only featuring For Tomorrow and Girls and Boys, with almost all the discussion on the latter. Therefore, Blur Vs Oasis is not discussed and ""Roll with It"" is not featured. Coldplay are the only one of the 'market chasing' bands to feature or be mentioned, although the album covers in Tesco are still shown. The discussion of the Libertines is also curtailed with no mention of the guerilla gigs, the internet, tattoos or Can't Stand Me Now. The Kaiser Chiefs also do not feature.

"Day language

Day is an Adamawa language of southern Chad, spoken by 50,000 or so people southeast of Sarh. Ethnologue reports that its dialects are mutually intelligible, but Blench (2004) lists Ndanga, Njira, Yani, Takawa as apparently separate languages.

Pierre Nougayrol's publications and field notes of Day from the 1970s constitute almost all of the available materials on the Day language.

Güldemann (2018) notes that Day has few morphological and lexical features that are typical of Niger-Congo, and hence cannot be classified with certainty.

"Doughboy Hollow

Doughboy Hollow is the fourth album by Australian rock band Died Pretty. The album, recorded with English producer Hugh Jones, was released in 1991.

Described by Ian McFarlane's Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop as ""brimming with passionate, dramatic and alluring musical vistas"", it took the band into the Top 20 album charts for the first time, peaking at No.19 in September 1991. The album led to three ARIA Award nominations in 1992—Album of the Year for Doughboy Hollow, Independent Single of the Year for ""D.C."" and Best Video, also for ""D.C."". It was also included in the 2010 book 100 Best Australian Albums.

Five years later, singer and co-writer Ron Peno said the album remained the band's creative watermark. ""Now there's an album that should have done something,"" he told the Daily Telegraph. ""It's a very loved album and I think it was a special record for us. I think it was criminal that it got ignored.""

"Paul Nogier

Paul Nogier (1908-1996) or Dr. Paul Nogier, was a French neurologist and physician who is considered the ""Father of modern auriculotherapy"", a version of  acupuncture, an  alternative medicine practice.

Nogier's Discoveries

Auriculotherapy
In 1957, Dr. Paul Nogier first presented his observations of the somatotopic correspondences of the ear, in which the external ear anatomically corresponds to an inverted fetus--the homunculus.

Nogier's pulse
Nogier also reported that there was a change in the amplitude and dimension of the patient's radial pulse when certain points on the auricle were stimulated. He called this the Nogier's pulse or Vascular Automonic Sign (VAS).

Nogier's frequencies
In the 1970s, Nogier developed seven frequencies A through G which he routinely used in medical practice for detection and treatment. In his practice, these frequencies are preferentially recognized by the body, so they enter into resonance to exert effects on the body.

"José Marrone

José Carlos Marrone (25 October 1915 in Buenos Aires – 27 June 1990 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine actor and humorist.

His beginning was in vaudeville theaters and the radio; afterwards he hosted several children-oriented TV shows, such as ""El Circo de Marrone""  (Marrone's Circus), playing the clown character Pepitito. His recurring catchphrase was Cheee!

He married twice and had his daughter ""Coqui"", with his first wife, Rosa. While still married, Marrone fell in love with Juanita Martínez, but they waited to get together until Rosa died. In 2001, eleven years after Marrone's death, Juanita committed suicide, and her body was found with a picture of Marrone in her hands.

""Pepitito"" Jose Marrone was one of the most outstanding comedians in Argentina between the early 1950s and the late 1960s.

"Thomas Chapin

Thomas Chapin (March 9, 1957 – February 13, 1998) was an American composer and saxophonist/multi-instrumentalist. Though primarily an alto saxophonist, he also played sopranino, as well as  soprano, tenor, baritone saxes and flute.

Many of his recordings as a leader featured his trio with drummer Michael Sarin and bassist Mario Pavone, occasionally joined by guests.

Chapin studied with Jackie McLean and Paul Jeffrey. He played with Lionel Hampton.

Chapin died of leukemia three weeks before his 41st birthday. He last played two weeks before his death, at a benefit concert.

Biography
Alto saxophonist and flautist, Thomas Chapin was born on March 9, 1957 in Manchester, Connecticut. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts where he studied classical music and jazz. He began his serious studies in the late 1970s, attending the Hartt School of Music at the University of Hartford in Connecticut, studying with saxophonist Jackie McLean.

In 1980 he graduated from Rutgers University where he studied with saxophonist Paul Jeffrey, pianist Kenny Barron and guitarist Ted Dunbar. From 1981 to 1986 he toured with the jazz grand master Lionel Hampton as lead saxophonist and musical director of the band. He also performed with Chico Hamilton's band from 1988 to 1989.

In the late 1980s he formed his own groups, of quartets, quintets, and a group and album devoted to Brazilian music, Spirits Rebellious (Alacra), as well as founding Machine Gun, a free-funk-free-jazz-rock band with guitarist/producer/engineer Robert Musso. But most notably, forming what became his signature group, a trio with bassist Mario Pavone and drummers Steve Johns and later, Michael Sarin. For nearly ten years Chapin pursued his own music, working with the Thomas Chapin Trio at festivals and clubs around the world, including milestone Trio career performances at the Madarao Jazz Festival (Japan) in 1994, where he also played with Betty Carter, and at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1995. He also arranged larger groups (Trio with Brass, ""Insomnia"" and Trio with Strings, ""Haywire""). And he spent a good deal of his time working with the more important names in various factions of jazz. He performed with Ray Drummond, Anthony Braxton, Tom Harrell, Sonny Sharrock, John Zorn, Walter Thompson, Dave Douglas, Marty Ehrlich, Ned Rothenberg and many more.

Over his career he recorded more than fifteen albums under his name alone, including Sky Piece and Night Bird Song, the last releases with his trio and several more straight-ahead albums, including with quartet/quintet groups in I've Got Your Number and You Don't Know Me on Arabesque Records.

Thomas Chapin died of leukemia in 1998 at age forty. The New York Times called him ""one of the more exuberant saxophonists and bandleaders in jazz"" and ""one of the few musicians to exist in both the worlds of the 'downtown' experimentalist scene, and mainstream jazz."" He is survived by his wife, Terri Castillo Chapin, whom he married on October 15, 1997, after ten years together, in New York Hospital while being treated. He died four months later.

"Alexandria Ariana

The first of many Alexandrias in the Far East of the Macedonian Empire, Alexandria in Ariana was a city in what is now Afghanistan, one of the twenty-plus cities founded or renamed by Alexander the Great. The third largest Afghan city, Herat, is the city's modern name.  

In 330 BC, the Greek armies of Alexander moved the capital of the satrapy of Aria from Artacoana to the new site. In doing this, he expanded an existing Persian fortress.

The location of this town is difficult to determine due to the sparsity of ancient sources. However:
 Ptolemy places it near lake Arius possibly on the west side of lake Zerra at a town called Corra.
 Pliny says it was on the Arias River at the location of modern Herat.
 Eratosthenes states that Alexandria Arion is 3870 Stadia from Bactra and 6400 Stadia from the Caspian Gates. 
  Mannert takes the Arius River to be the modern Hari river making the site  the village of Pilki.

Alexandria in Ariana is listed on the Parthian Stations Itinerarium and is also shown on the Tabula Peutingeriana.

"1950 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team

The 1950 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team was the representative of the University of Nebraska and member of the Big 7 Conference in the 1950 college football season. The team was coached by Bill Glassford and played their home games at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Before the season
After the dark decade of the 1940s, where the Cornhusker program found only one winning season, second-year head coach Glassford had arrived and brought a faint hope to the Cornhusker faithful by fielding a 1949 team that appeared competitive.  As coach Glassford settled in for his second year, he increased the coaching staff from seven to nine personnel, and the new decade opened with hopes that Nebraska could once again take its place among the best of the college football programs in the United States.

On April 8, 1950, Nebraska held its first ever Spring Game scrimmage (later known as the Red-White Game) against a team of Nebraska alumni players (supplemented by a handful of varsity members). The two teams played to a 13–13 tie.

Game summaries

Indiana

Nebraska put a stop to Indiana's seven-game winning streak against the Cornhuskers by bringing a strong performance to the opening game of the season.  The Hoosiers escaped a defeat only by a handful of fumbles lost by Cornhusker miscues.  It was the first time since 1938 that Nebraska had fought a contest to a tie, a 0–0 scoreless affair which also happened to be against Indiana.  The Cornhuskers pulled up to 3–7–3 against Indiana to date.

Minnesota

Encouraged by the strong showing the week prior against the Hoosiers, Nebraska traveled to Minneapolis and refused to be intimidated by the Golden Gophers.  By the time Minnesota managed to score, Nebraska was already enjoying a 26–0 lead and had the Gophers on their heels.  Minnesota's adjustments after halftime brought some results, but not enough for them to escape the rare home field defeat.  Minnesota's ten-game winning streak against Nebraska was snapped at last, and the Cornhuskers reveled in their first win in Minneapolis since a 6–0 decision against the Gophers dating back to 1902.  Nebraska now stood at 5–25–2 in the series and had much ground to cover if they ever hoped to catch up, but the momentous win was cause to celebrate.  Perhaps Nebraska was finally on the way back.

Colorado

Fresh from their triumph in Minneapolis, the Cornhuskers arrived in Boulder looking for another win to establish the return of the program to greatness.  Colorado would have none of that, however, and dealt the uninspired Nebraska squad its first loss of the season to move to 3–6–3 in the series.

Penn State

Nebraska bounced back from the flat performance of the week before, and was firing on all cylinders when Penn State arrived in Lincoln for the first time ever in the third meeting of these teams.  Cornhusker HB Bobby Reynolds accounted for more personal yards on the day then the entire Nittany Lion team, and the Nebraska defense held strong to prevent Penn State from ever finding the scoreboard, securing the first Nebraska win in the series.  So far, except for the aberration in Boulder, the season had opened with exceptional success as the Cornhuskers were undefeated against three powerhouse teams, two of which were longtime rivals.

Kansas

The Cornhuskers continued to build on the season's rising tide of successes by defeating the Jayhawks in Lawrence, snapping their three-game skid against Kansas.  Nebraska was now 41–12–3 against the Jayhawks all-time.

Missouri

The 1950 homecoming game was attended by former Cornhusker football players who had battled in the 1941 Rose Bowl ten seasons prior, and the new decade's version of the Cornhuskers did not disappoint.  For the first time since 1945, Nebraska pulled in a homecoming victory, in an offensive shootout that amassed  over 1,000 combined offensive yards by both teams.  The defeat of Missouri ended a five-game Tiger winning streak, and put Nebraska ahead in the series at 25–15–3.

Kansas State

Kansas State found itself in the path of a rolling Cornhusker squad that was listed in the AP Poll for the first time since 1941, and was unable to get out of the way as the Cornhuskers hung 49 points on the scoreboard before the final whistle, which was the most points scored in a single game by Nebraska since a 53–0 blanking of lowly South Dakota in 1945.  Nebraska had now defeated the Wildcats in eight straight meetings and continued to lead the series at 28–4–2.

Iowa State

Apparently the voters in the AP Poll were not adequately impressed with Nebraska's win over downtrodden Kansas State the previous week, as the Cornhuskers actually fell two spots in the poll before facing Iowa State in Lincoln.  A single touchdown proved to be the difference in the game, as the Cyclones fought a fairly close game, holding Nebraska to under 30 points for the first time in four games.  The Cornhuskers increased their commanding series lead to 35–8–1.

Oklahoma

Nebraska faced its stiffest test of the season when the Cornhuskers traveled to Norman to close the regular season, as the Sooners held a record seven-game winning streak over Nebraska and was the #1 ranked team in the AP Poll going into the game.  Nebraska fought in front of a substantial crowd, managing to put up 35 points against the number one team in the land on their own turf, but Oklahoma romped over the Cornhusker defenses and racked up 49 points of their own to finish the season on top of the conference and the nation.  Nebraska's record single-team losing streak, held by Oklahoma, was extended to eight games.  The Sooners finished the season undefeated at 9–0–0, and closed the series record gap between the squads to 10–16–3.

After the season
Coach Glassford's second season was a resounding success, as Nebraska end its brutal nine-season losing skid, and notched high-profile wins against Penn State and Minnesota in the process.  The season-ending loss to national champion Oklahoma could be tolerated, leaving just the one letdown loss to Colorado to truly mar the season, though the positive turnaround of fortunes was so dramatic that few would complain.  Nebraska ended the season ranked in the AP Poll for the first time in ten years.  Coach Glassford's conference record improved to 7–5–0 (.583), as his overall record climbed to 10–7–1 (.583).  The Cornhusker football program's overall record improved to 326–155–32 (.667), though the conference record declined slightly to 127–42–11 (.736).

"Sheraton Skyline Hotel at London Heathrow

Sheraton Skyline Hotel at London Heathrow is a 4-star hotel in London, England. It is located at Bath Road in Hayes Middlesex, near Heathrow Airport. The hotel, built in 1971, is operated by the Sheraton hotel group and has 350 rooms.
The hotel was purchased in 2015 by Qatar Airways, the first such hotel to be branded under the airline's Oryx brand.

History
The hotel opened for business on 1 October 1971 with a single room price of £6 and double-rooms priced at £9. That same year the hotel formed part of a group called the London Heathrow Conference Service with most of the major hotels in the area,  to specifically target business travelers and ""become the business meeting centre of Europe"". The Skyline Hotel, along with Skyline Park Tower in Knightsbridge were developed by Capital & Counties. Skyline sold them to both to a Sheraton subsidiary for a combined £4 million in 1977. From the outset the hotel became known for hosting numerous international business conferences. On 9 March 1977, the ""Transport of hazardous cargoes by air"" conference was held at the hotel. During the 1970s, entertainment at the hotel included Diamond Lil's Wild West Cabaret, which ran up to six nights a week, and the house band The Banjo Boys. In 1980 the Turkish Cypriot business community met at the hotel to discuss trade and investment between Turkey and the UK.

In 1981, John Rotter was appointed controller of the Sheraton Management Corporation and controller of the Sheraton Skyline Hotel. In 1988, Swedish property development consortium Reinhold Int bought the hotel for nearly £40 million.

At the end of 1996, the hotel completed the Department of National Heritage's certification in the Investors in People Program, which rates the performance of employers in the hospitality industry. The certification marks employers who have high training and incentive programs for employees in one of Britain's fasted-growing employment sectors. The Sheraton Skyline was one of the venues for the first four days of the Congress in London, held between 4 and 11 July 1997. For a period it was known as the Sheraton Skyline Hotel and Conference Centre.

In May 2002, hundreds of people were evacuated from the hotel by fire services, after it was reported that guests could smell ammonia. In early November 2007 there was a hit-and-run incident at the hotel when Detective Constable Cathy Corbett, 39, was rundown by a blue Peugeot 207, suffering serious head injuries.

The hotel was purchased in 2015 by Qatar Airways, the first such hotel to be branded under the airline's Oryx brand.

Architecture and facilities
The Sheraton Skyline was built in 1971 by Curtis and Davies and designed by Ronald Fielding. The hotel is noted for its ""atrium design"". The hotel features 350 rooms.

The hotel has several restaurants including Madhu's Heathrow, Sports Bar & Grill and the Sky Bar, which serves cocktails. The menu at Madhu's Heathrow features Punjabi cuisine, based on recipes from the original Madhu Indian Restaurant, located in Southall, West London. It is the first branch of the 33-year-old establishment. It previously had a Mediterranean restaurant called The Garden, which overlooked the hotel's swimming pool. A 1983 article in The Law Society's Gazette stated: ""An earthly paradise appears in the shape of the Sheraton Skyline Hotel at Heathrow, where the chef, Uwe Zander, has a fantastic number of awards"".

"Ventôse Decrees

The Ventôse Decrees were decrees proposed on February 26 and March 3, 1794 (8 and 13 Ventôse, An II in the French Republican Calendar) by the French revolutionary leader Louis de Saint-Just.  Saint-Just proposed to confiscate the property of exiles and opponents of the Revolution, and redistribute it to the needy.  Saint-Just and other radicals argued that the enemies of the revolution had forfeited their civil rights, including the right to own property.

Robespierre supported the Decrees in theory, but realized that he lacked the support to implement them, and efforts to enforce the Decrees ended within a few months.

"Systematic Compilation of Federal Legislation

The Systematic Compilation of Federal Legislation (, SR; , RS; , RS) is the official compilation of all Swiss federal laws, ordinances, international and intercantonal treaties that are in force. However, some very voluminous parts of laws, such as the customs code, are not published in their entirety, but only by way of reference; they are usually made available on the websites of the government agencies responsible.

In the SR/RS, the acts are published in a consolidated form, that is, the text is updated to reflect any amendment that enters into force through publication in the Official Compilation of Federal Legislation (AS/RO/RU). By itself, publication in the SR/RS does not confer force of law. The legally binding text is that of the individual acts published in the AS/RO/RU.

It is issued in the three official languages of Switzerland: German, French and Italian. All three language editions are equally valid. It is published by the Federal Chancellery of Switzerland in the form of weekly supplements to loose leaf binders. Since 1999, they are also made available on the Internet in PDF and HTML formats.

"Manny Puig

Manny ""Sharkman"" Puig (born 25 January 1954) is an American wildlife entertainer who is known for his direct approach when dealing with dangerous animals such as sharks, black bears and American alligators. He has made frequent appearances on the television shows Jackass and Wildboyz and also on the Animal Planet show Gator Boys. He was also known for hosting Outdoor Channel's ""Savage Wild"". Manny Puig has appeared in countless documentaries as an animal expert and even appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and on Shark Week.

Early life

Manny Puig was born in Cuba and immigrated to Florida with his mother, where he became interested in wildlife. Living so close to the Florida Keys only increased his interest in animals and his love for learning about wildlife only skyrocketed. In his youth, Puig traveled into the Everglades with only a frying pan and a shotgun. He learned to hunt deer at an early age and started hand-catching small American alligators underwater in his teens.

Career
In the late 1990s, Puig worked with Mehgan Heaney-Grier and Mark Rackley, both in training Grier as a free diver and in filming underwater encounters with animals such as alligators and sharks. Rackley worked as a spearfisherman and underwater videographer. Puig had experience as an animal handler on movie sets and had learned how to ride and handle alligators in their environment. The trio formed a company named Extreme Encounters.

Puig advocates a basic approach to wildlife and denounces the use of safety gear such as cages, protective clothing and diving apparatus. He states that he has a great respect for the Native Americans because of their interaction with the land and their survival skills. His interests also include history, art and geography documentaries. He spends his free time working on sculpting, hand-crafting medieval weapons and hunting tools.

Puig has appeared on the television program Jackass, in Jackass The Movie, Jackass Number Two, and Jackass 3D. In these projects, he is credited as an expert on predatory animals. One of Puig's stunts is featured in the second film, where he dives with Steve-O around hammerhead and other dangerous sharks. Steve-O recalled the segment in his autobiography, stating: ""The following day, Pontius and I were scheduled to swim with great hammerhead sharks, accompanied by Manny....with the butt piercing wound still fresh, swimming with sharks might not have been very smart, but Manny wasn't worried about it....In retrospect, the fact that Manny was the arbiter of what was safe and reasonable is hilarious. He hatched and okayed plenty of ideas that were clearly not okay. So you knew if he said no to something, that meant ""FUCK NO!"" As it happened, Manny had no problem sending us swimming with great hammerheads."" 

Puig is also featured on the MTV program Wildboyz, where he resumes the role of a predatory-animal expert. Some of Puig's stunts on Wildboyz include having a snapping turtle lock onto his hand. According to Chris Pontius on the special features of one of the Wildboyz DVDs, he heard Puig scream for the first time in his life when he had the snapping turtle bite his hand in the Deep South, United States.

After finishing the second Jackass movie and with the final season of Wildboyz having completed, Puig produced his own film entitled Ultimate Predator. The film shows him interacting particularly with sharks. The film also features adventures with Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, Chris Pontius and Jeff Tremaine.

Puig also appeared on ""Feeding Time"" during Discovery Channel's Shark Week in 2007.

Puig was featured on the Outdoor Channel show called Savage Wild.  The episodes of Savage Wild take place in the Everglades and surrounding environs near Miami, Florida and range from Manny hunting a wild boar with only a rudimentary spear, or carefully maneuvering through the water with a monster alligator, or handling highly venomous wild snakes, such as water moccasins, in their natural environment.  One of his amazing feats is his ability to sneak up right in front of an alligator under water and grab hold of the alligators skin under its jaw and hold on as the alligator thrashes about under water and leaping out trying to bite and shake him off.  The cameraman is just as daring as he dips into the murky water to film Puig's feats in the unknown. 

Manny's left middle finger is missing after it had to be amputated because of a rattlesnake bite in 2011.

"The Masque of Blackness

The Masque of Blackness was an early Jacobean era masque, first performed at the Stuart Court in the Banqueting Hall of Whitehall Palace on Twelfth Night, 6 January 1605. It was written by Ben Jonson at the request of Anne of Denmark, the queen consort of King James I, who wished the masquers to be disguised as Africans. Anne was one of the performers in the masque along with her court ladies, all of whom appeared in black face makeup.

The plot of the masque follows the ladies arriving at the English Court talking amongst themselves of how black complexions used to be beautiful, ""that in their black, the perfect'st beauty grows."" Reflecting the historical context of the masque, the ladies go on to discuss how black skin is now deemed the least attractive, ""now black, with black despair"" in favor of skin that has been ""blanch[ed]"" meaning whitened or lightened. They also agree that while black skin is exotic, light-skinned people are ultimately the best. During the Jacobean era, dark skin was associated with corruption, while white or lighter skin was associated with purity. Whereas Ethiopians (then a general term for black Africans) were viewed as impatient and ill-tempered due to the hot, dry weather in their native country, the light-skinned English were seen as more in control of themselves because their climate was cool and wet. As a result of this trend, The Masque of Beauty was written as a sequel to The Masque of Blackness to convey a greater disdain for darker skin tones.

The Masque of Beauty, originally intended for the following holiday season, was displaced by Hymenaei, the masque for the wedding of the Earl of Essex and Frances Howard. Beauty was finally performed in 1608.

Design
The sets, costumes, and stage effects were designed by Inigo Jones; Blackness was the first of many masques for the Stuart Court on which Jonson and Jones would collaborate. The music for Blackness was composed by Alfonso Ferrabosco.

Jones designed a raised and mobile stage for the masque, forty feet square and four feet off the floor; this was employed for many subsequent masques. The stage contained inner space for the machines that produced stage effects and the technicians who operated them. The King was often stilling on a stool, resembling the sun. Blackness introduced effects that Jones would repeat with variation throughout his career as a stage designer: it opened with a tempestuous seascape, simulated by flowing and billowing cloths.

The opening stormy sea was populated with six blue-haired merman-like tritons. The gods Oceanus (""blue"") and Niger (black) entered, mounted upon giant seahorses. The twelve daughters of Niger, played by the Queen and her ladies in waiting, entered in the company of a dozen nymphs of Oceanus as torchbearers; the ladies of the Court were dressed in tones of silver and azure to contrast with the blackness of the makeup, with pearls and feathers in their hair, while the torchbearers, in green doublets with gold puffed sleeves, had their faces, hands, and hair dyed blue. The ladies rode in a great hollow seashell, which seemed to float upon and move with the waves, and was accompanied by six large sea monsters carrying more torchbearers. (With Blackness as with many subsequent masques designed by Jones, one of the aspects of the show most commented upon by witnesses was the dazzling intensity of light involved...which inevitably says something about the normal conditions of life in the Jacobean era.)

Plot summary
The text begins with Niger talking to his father Oceanus. Oceanus asks him why he has left his usual eastward course and flowed westward, into the Atlantic. Niger tells him that he has come to request help. Niger's daughters are upset because they thought of themselves to be the most beautiful goddesses in the world, but they found out that paleness is more attractive and no longer feel beautiful. The moon goddess, Aethiopia, tells the daughters to find a country that ends in ""tannia"" and they will be beautiful once more.

The daughters desperately tried finding the country and even went to Mauritania (North Africa), Lusitania (Portugal), and Aquitania (France). They prayed once more to Aethiopia and she told them the country is Britannia. She told them that the king was sun-like and he would be able to bleach the black away. Aethiopia stated that once a month for the next year, the daughters should bathe in sea-dew and at the same time next year, they will appear before the king again, and his light will make them beautiful and white.

Cast
The principal cast of the masque:

Queen Anne................Euphoris
Countess of Bedford........Aglaia
Lady Herbert...............Diaphane
 Countess of Derby.....Eucampse
Lady Rich........................Ocyte
Countess of Suffolk.......Kathare

Lady Bevill.........................Notis
Lady Effingham...........Psychrote
Lady Elizabeth Howard....Glycyte
Lady Susan Vere.............Malacia
Lady Mary Wroth...............Baryte
Lady Walsingham.........Periphere

A newsletter from court described the cast of the ""Queen's mask"" in December 1604, noting that three women were excused because of illness, the Countess of Nottingham, the Countess of Richmond who had measles, and the Countess of Northumberland. Lady Hatton was not invited to perform and left court.

Response
The masque was controversial in its day, in part for the production's use of body paint instead of masks to simulate dark skin. One observer, Sir Dudley Carleton, expressed a view tinged with the prevailing social biases of an era which saw the growing prominent role of the British in the Atlantic slave trade:

 
Controversy also stemmed from the predominant role of female actresses playing what were considered traditionally male roles.

The masque was expensive, costing £3000, and caused consternation among some English observers due to the perceived impropriety of the performance.

The texts of The Masque of Blackness and The Masque of Beauty were published together in quarto form in 1608, by the bookseller Thomas Thorpe; they were reprinted in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616.

"Joe Avati

Joe Avati (born 1974) is an Italian-Australian comedian who is popular among Italian and descendant of Italians from his native Australia, as well as in Canada, United Kingdom and the United States, where he has performed on several occasions.

Comedic style 
His parents are from Calabria in Italy and some of his show is performed in the Calabrese dialect, in English with or without a Calabrese accent.

Avati's observational brand of comedy have earned him comparisons to Jerry Seinfeld, and in promotions he is referred to as ""the Italian Seinfeld"". His observations are drawn from the life around his Italian family, particularly his experiences growing up. The characters and traits that Avati mentions seem to be universal in Italian families, which is why audiences familiar with this cultures are able to identify with him.

Career 
Avati kicked off his career by releasing a tape entitled ""Livin' la Dole-Cheque Vita"" in late 1999. He also released Live and Unpluggato in late 2000 which was placed on the internet as a downloadable MP3. This album went on to become the number one selling comedy album in Canada for 18 months.

The stage show - IL DAGO - a ""boy band"" parody act was produced by Joe Avati and toured to major cities and regional centers around Australia from April 2007 until December 2009. IL Dago starred Joe Avati, George Kapiniaris, Simon Palomares & Nish Selvadurai. The show won the prestigious: ""Most Outstanding Club Performers of the Year"" and ""Best Comedy Act of 2007"" at the 10th Annual Australian Club Entertainment Awards. 

Avati began a national Canadian Tour in April 2008 followed by an extended tour of the award winning IL DAGO show throughout that same year.

"Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command (Russia)

The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command (), is a military command of Russia.

It is one of the five military districts of the Russian Armed Forces, with its jurisdiction primarily within the northern region of European Russia and the Arctic Ocean. The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command was established on 1 December 2014 when it was split off from the Western Military District, initially as Russia's only joint military command to give greater autonomy to the Russian Navy's Northern Fleet. The command is equal in status to a military district, and is planned to develop into a full military district in cooperation with the Central Military District and Eastern Military District, to concentrate on all military responsibility over Russia's territories in the Arctic.  

The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command contains 4 federal subjects of Russia: Arkhangelsk Oblast, Komi Republic, Murmansk Oblast, Nenets Autonomous Okrug. Additionally, the command contains most of Russia's islands in the Arctic Sea, including those located in federal subjects not within the command.

The Northern Fleet Joint Strategic Command is headquartered in Severomorsk, and its current district commander is Vice-Admiral Aleksandr Moiseyev, who has held the position since 3 May 2019.

Bases 
The Russian Ministry of Defence is in the process of building 13 air-defense radar stations in the Russian Arctic.

Airfields and ports on several islands, which were last used by the Soviet Union, will be re-opened: the 'Temp Air Base' on (Kotelnyy Island) in New Siberian Islands, Rogachevo Air Base on Novaya Zemlya and the Nagurskoye Air Base in the Franz Josef Land archipelago. A newly built naval base on the Wrangel Island will add to that.

In addition, at least seven airfields on the continental part of the Arctic Circle will be opened or re-opened, with Tiksi in Yakutia expected to house the bulk of the Arctic air force. Other continental airfields include Naryan-Mar Airport, Alykel Airport close to the city of Norilsk and Mys Shmidta and Ugolny Airport, both located in Chukotka.

Units

Naval Forces 
As of January, 7th, 2015, the commander of the Northern Fleet reportedly envisaged a series of coordination-improving tasks, including submarine underwater operations, assigned to cruise vessels. Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov also said that it will be set up a specialised training centre for servicemen doing military service in the Arctic Region in 2015.

Ground forces 
The ground element of the command will incorporate two Arctic motorized infantry brigades, including the 200th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade and the 80th Independent Motor Rifle Brigade (Alakurtti)(formed January 2015).

The brigades are expected to accomplish coast patrolling missions, protect sites and territories on the coast of the northern seas and the Arctic Ocean, support and escort ships sailing along the Northern Sea Route, and demonstrate the military presence in the Arctic.

According to the Commander-in-Chief of the Ground Forces, Colonel General Oleg Salyukov, an Arctic motorized rifle brigade is, as of October 2014, under formation in the Murmansk Oblast, near the Norwegian border, while the second brigade is scheduled for 2016 to be stationed in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug.

516th Fleet Signals Unit (Severomorsk)

Air and air defence forces 
Air Defence forces are said to consist of Pantsir-S1 missile and artillery systems, which have been put on duty on the Kotelnyy Island of the New Siberian Islands archipelago in 2014. The deployment of intermediate and long-range air defence systems in this area has also been planned.

The command involved was the 1st Air and Air Defence Forces Command, including the 531st, 583rd, and 1258th Air Defence Regiments, the 331st and 332d Radio-Technical Regiments, plus other units stationed in the Murmansk, Chukotka and Arkhangelsk Oblasts. Air Force Commander-in-Chief Colonel-General Viktor Bondarev said in an interview that by 2017 the Tiksi airport complex will be operational, and it will be garrisoned with upgraded MiG-31 interceptors.

A number of redesignations from 2014 changed the apparent order of battle. Air and Space Defence Brigades were changed back to the familiar nomenclature of Air Defence Divisions, and thus the 1st Air Defence Division (Russia) was reformed. The 1st Air and Air Defence Forces Command returned to the previous title 6th Air and Air Defence Forces Army. In January 2016, Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced that the Northern Fleet 45th Air and Air Defence Army (:ru:45-я армия ВВС и ПВО Северного флота) had been formed in December 2015. The force includes the 1st and 3rd Air Defence Divisions, and at least six other aircraft regiments, including the 100th and 279th Shipborne Fighter Aviation Regiments, and the 73rd Anti-Submarine Squadron Long Range of Tupolev Tu-142s.

"Roman de la Rose

Le Roman de la Rose (The Romance of the Rose) is a medieval French poem styled as an allegorical dream vision. As poetry, The Romance of the Rose is a notable instance of courtly literature meant to entertain and to teach about the art of romantic love. Throughout the narrative, the word Rose is used both as the name of the titular lady and as an abstract symbol of female sexuality. The names of the other characters function both as personal names and as metonyms illustrating the different factors that lead to and constitute a love affair.

The Romance of the Rose was written in two stages. In the first stage of composition, circa 1230, Guillaume de Lorris wrote 4,058 lines describing a courtier's attempts at wooing his beloved woman. The first part of the poem's story is set in a walled garden, an example of a  locus amoenus, a traditional literary topos in epic poetry and chivalric romance. Forty-five years later, circa 1275, in the second stage of composition, Jean de Meun wrote 17,724 additional lines, in which allegorical personages, such as Reason, Nature, and Genius, discuss the philosophy of love and the Lover attains his goal.

Reception

Early
The Romance of the Rose was both popular and controversial. One of the most widely read works in France for three centuries, it was possibly the most read book in Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries. Its emphasis on sensual language and imagery provoked attacks by Jean Gerson, Christine de Pizan and many other writers and moralists of the 14th and 15th centuries. Historian Johan Huizinga writes: ""It is astonishing that the Church, which so rigorously repressed the slightest deviations from dogma of a speculative character, suffered the teaching of this breviary of the aristocracy (for the Roman de la Rose was nothing else) to be disseminated with impunity.""

Modern
Later reactions suggested that it had a tenuous encyclopedic quality. The nineteenth-century scholar and writer Gaston Paris wrote that it was ""an encyclopedia in disorder"" and British author C. S. Lewis described it as having an ""encyclopedic character"". One historian wrote that while the Roman de la Rose is obviously not an encyclopedia, ""it evokes one, represents one, dreams one, perhaps, with all its aspirations and limitations"".

Manuscripts and incunabula

About 300 manuscripts are extant, one of the highest figures for a secular work. Many of these are illustrated, most with fewer than ten remaining illustrations, but there are a number with twenty or more illustrations, and the exceptional Burgundian British Library Harley MS 4425 has 92 large and high quality miniatures, despite a date around 1500; the text was copied by hand from a printed edition. These are by the artist known as the Master of the Prayer Books of around 1500, commissioned by Count Engelbert II of Nassau. The peak period of production was the 14th century, but manuscript versions continued to be produced until the advent of printing, and indeed afterwards – there are at least seven manuscripts dated after 1500.  There are also seven incunabula printed editions before 1500, the first from Geneva in about 1481, followed by two from Lyons in the 1480s and four from Paris in the 1490s. An edition from Lyons in 1503 is illustrated with 140 woodcuts. Digital images of more than 140 of these manuscripts are available for study in the Roman de la Rose Digital Library.

Translation and influence
Part of the story was translated from its original Old French into Middle English as The Romaunt of the Rose, which had a great influence on English literature. Chaucer was familiar with the original French text, and a portion of the Middle English translation is thought to be his work. Critics suggest that the character of ""La Vieille"" acted as source material for Chaucer's Wife of Bath. There were several other early translations into languages including Middle Dutch (Heinrik van Aken, c. 1280). Il Fiore is a ""reduction"" of the poem into 232 Italian sonnets by a ""ser Durante"", sometimes thought to have been Dante, although this is generally thought unlikely. Dante never mentions the Roman, but is often said to have been highly conscious of it in his own work. In 1900, the pre-Raphaelite F. S. Ellis translated the whole of the poem into English verse. C. S. Lewis's 1936 study The Allegory of Love renewed interest in the poem.

"Ballycar Castle

Ballycar Castle stood in the parish of Newmarket-on-Fergus, near the road between Limerick and Galway,  from Sixmilebridge,  from Limerick, and  from Ennis it was said to have been built before 1570 and was a ruin before 1681 when it was sketched by Thomas Dineley.

Ballycar Castle was said to have been built by Connor McHugh-McLoghlin-McNamara, but does not appear among the list of castles in 1570. In 1580 it belonged to Donogh O’Brien. The Castle, and two plowlands, of Ballycarhy were passed in the Earl of Thomond’s patent of 1620. In 1655, a lease of Ballycar Castle, &c., ""as heretofore held by George Colpoys, deceased"", was made by the Earl of Thomond to John Colpoys, with the condition to supply an armed Protestant horseman, provided for a month. This lease was converted in 1714 into a fee farm, and by the 1890s had passed to heirs female.

The castle was a ruin when it was sketched by Thomas Dineley in 1680 and had disappeared by the 1890s. The house that had been built on the site (and which had last been occupied by a magistrate), was by then a roofless ruin.

"Šajkaška

Šajkaška (Шајкашка) is a historical region in northern Serbia. It is southeastern part of Bačka, located in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. Territory of Šajkaška is divided among four municipalities: Titel, Žabalj, Novi Sad, and Srbobran. Historical center of Šajkaška is Titel.

Name
Name Šajkaška means ""land of šajkaši"". Šajkaši were a specific kind of Austrian army, which moved in narrow, long boats, known as ""šajka"". These military units have operated on the Danube, Tisa, Sava and Moriš rivers. In Hungarian, the region is known as Sajkásvidék and in German as Schajkaschka.

History 
After 1400, the majority of the people in Šajkaška were Serbs who had settled the area before or after the Ottoman conquered the Balkan lands to the south . Moving further north, they had become established at csepel Island where they founded Srpski Kovin (Raczkeve). After 1526 and the Battle of Mohacs, they moved to the northern Danube and to the city of Komarno which, for a long time, was the administrative headquarters of the Šajkaš forces. 

After the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699, the region was part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Most of Šajkaška was included into Habsburg Military Frontier (its Danube and Tisa sections), while one part of the region was included into Bodrog County. When these parts of Military Frontier were abolished (in 1750), Šajkaška was included into Theiss District, which was part of the Batsch-Bodrog County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. In 1763, Šajkaška was excluded from Theiss District and was again placed under military administration. Šajkaš Battalion, as part of Military Frontier, was founded in this area. In the beginning of the Habsburg administration, the population of the region was composed entirely of Serbs, which were brave and skillful warriors. Serb Šajkaši have participated in many battles against Ottoman Empire.
 
By 1739 and the Peace of Belgrade, the border between Austria and Turkey was moved to the Sava and Danube rivers, and at that time, the idea was proposed to move the Šajkaši down from the north. That was done in 1763-1764. 
 
In 1848-1849, region was part of autonomous Serbian Vojvodina, but was again included into Military Frontier in 1849. In 1852, Šajkaš battalion was transformed into Titel infantry battalion. This military unit was abolished in 1873, and region was again incorporated into Bács-Bodrog County. Administratively, territory of Šajkaška was organized into municipality of Titel and separate municipality of Žabalj was also later established. In 1910, ethnic Serbs formed an absolute majority in both municipalities. Besides Serbs who formed majority in most settlements, region was also populated by Hungarians who formed majority in the village Budisava and sizable minority in few other settlements, Germans who formed sizable minority in several settlements and Rusyns who formed sizable minority in Đurđevo.

In 1918, as part of Banat, Bačka and Baranja region, Šajkaška became part of the Kingdom of Serbia and then part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922 Šajkaška was part of the Novi Sad County, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Belgrade Oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, region was occupied by the Axis Powers and was attached to Bács-Bodrog County of the Horthy's Hungary. In 1942 raid, Hungarian occupational authorities killed numerous ethnic Serbs, Jews and Romani in Šajkaška. In 1944, Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav partisans expelled Axis forces from the region and Šajkaška became part of the autonomous province of Vojvodina within new socialist Yugoslavia. Since 1945, AP Vojvodina is part of the People's Republic of Serbia within Yugoslavia. Today, Šajkaška is mainly agricultural region, with well-developed food industry.

Demographics
In 2002, population of Šajkaška numbered 67,355 people, including:
Serbs = 57,418 (85.25%)
Hungarians = 3,170 (4.71%)
Rusyns = 1,474 (2.19%)
Romani = 1,166 (1.73%)
Yugoslavs = 987 (1.47%)
Croats = 511 (0.76%)
Slovaks = 228 (0.34%)

"Southern Mandarin dogfish

The southern Mandarin dogfish (Cirrhigaleus australis) is a species of Mandarin dogfish shark in the genus Cirrhigaleus.  It was distinguished from Cirrhigaleus barbifer, which lives in the North Pacific, on an expedition in the coral reefs near Australia in 2007.  It is now known to live in the temperate waters in south-eastern Australia and from the Bay of Plenty region in New Zealand, at depths of 146–640 metres.

Physical characteristics
It is medium-sized and robust compared to other dogfish.  It is grey-brown above and pale below. The posterior margins of the pectoral and pelvic fins are white.  This species of shark normally grow less than a metre long, but have been known to reach 1.25 metres. C. australis has smaller eyes, pectoral fins, dorsal fins, and spine than its cousin.  The first dorsal fin is medium-sized and slightly raked.  The second is similarly shaped, but a bit smaller.  The pectoral fins are fairly large.  Both dorsal spines are long.  It also has strangely long barbels, giving it the name ""Mandarin"".  There are about 115 centra along the back.

Scientists say the shark is harmless.  Its defensive techniques are useless against many larger fish, and, as a consequence, it is very vulnerable to other sharks and fish.  Also, the southern Mandarin dogfish has very low resilience, its population doubling only about every 14 years.

Expedition
In 2007, a group of scientists from CSIRO spent some time searching the Eastern coast of Australia for new species.  Along with the newly distinguished Cirrhigaleus australis, several hundreds of new marine species were discovered.  Included were skates, sea stars, corals, bivalves, brachiopods, several types of marine arthropods, and many others.

They conducted research in three outings, each three weeks long.  Two outings were in the Great Barrier Reef on Lizard Island and Heron Island, and the third was in the Ningaloo Reef on the northwest coast of Australia.

Conservation status 
In June 2018 the New Zealand Department of Conservation classified the southern Mandarin dogfish as ""At Risk – Naturally Uncommon"" with the qualifiers ""Data Poor"" and ""Threatened Overseas"" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System.

"Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries

Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries is an Australian drama television series. It was first broadcast on ABC on 24 February 2012. It is based on author Kerry Greenwood's historical mystery novels, and it was created by Deb Cox and Fiona Eagger. The series revolves around the personal and professional life of Phryne Fisher (Essie Davis), a glamorous private detective in 1920s Melbourne. Three series have been broadcast, and a feature film titled Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears is due for release. A television spin-off Ms Fisher's Modern Murder Mysteries was broadcast in 2019. Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries has been aired in over 100 territories.

Plot and series
Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries revolves around the personal and professional life of Phryne Fisher (Essie Davis), a glamorous private detective in late 1920s Melbourne. In the first series, a running theme is the kidnapping and death of Phryne's younger sister Janey when they were children watching a circus, a crime that still haunts Phryne, feeling she should have protected her sister.

The first thirteen-part series was filmed over a six-month period in and around Melbourne from July 2011 and each episode had a budget of A$1 million. The drama has been bought by broadcasters in 120 countries and territories worldwide. A second series was commissioned in August 2012 and filming began in February 2013. The series began airing from 6 September 2013 and concluded with a Christmas special on 22 December 2013. A third series was commissioned in June 2014 and began airing on 8 May 2015.

Production

Background
Head writer and producer of the series, Deb Cox, has said that she and Fiona Eagger were looking to adapt a crime novel for television and believed the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) were looking for a prime-time crime series for their network. The producers were disappointed by what they initially found and Cox explained: ""It takes so long to raise the finance and script and produce a television series, so you need to feel it's worthwhile—both financially and philosophically. It was hard to find a reason to bring stories about psychotic killers and serial murderers to the screen."" Cox and Eagger then came across Kerry Greenwood's Phryne Fisher murder mystery series and were drawn to them because of their diverse fan base.

Eagger said that they were curious to discover what made the series appeal to all generations. Eagger told a writer for If Magazine, ""We were a bit curious to know what it was about it that could appeal to a 16-year-old and a 70-year-old. Phryne is one of the first feminists. She chooses to live alone, she chooses not to get married. She's got many lovers. She's a bit of a James Bond action hero—she's much better dressed than James Bond though."" Cox and Eagger realised that the novels reflected their moral values and fit in with their style of storytelling, so they began adapting them.

Cox and Eagger initially thought adapting novels would be easier than writing an original screenplay, but soon discovered that it was not. Speaking to Andrew Wrathall from Fancygoods.com.au, Cox stated, ""It takes a whole new set of skills to preserve what's most important in the stories, rationalise the impossible, gather what's left into a cohesive whole and still reflect the boundless worlds of imagination encouraged in the readers' minds by a few hundred words on paper—in a way that's achievable in production terms!"" She added that the restrictions tested their limits of creativity and inventiveness. Greenwood was invited to the first brainstorming session for the series and provided the producers with answers to their questions and helped with the historical background to the novels. The author would read the scripts and help make corrections. Cox praised Greenwood's ability to write for the screen and accept the changes they made to the novels.

In June 2011, it was announced that the ABC had commissioned a thirteen-part series to air on their ABC1 channel the following year. The drama was originally titled The Phryne Fisher Murder Mystery Series, but was changed on the advice of distributor All3Media, who wanted to avoid having to tell international broadcasters how to pronounce Phryne's name.

Series 1
The first series was filmed over a six-month period in and around Melbourne from July 2011. Greenwood had researched the history of the city ""meticulously"" for the novels, so the producers were keen to do the same. While they used some real locations, others were recreated, including a Turkish bathhouse and the Eastern Market. The interior of Phryne's house was built on a sound stage at the ABC's studio in Elsternwick. The historic house Wardlow in Parkville, Victoria was used as the exterior to the house. A number of National Trust houses provide settings including Rippon Lea Estate at Elsternwick, Labassa at Caulfield North and Como House in South Yarra. Each episode had a budget of $1 million. Eagger said ""I wanted every cent on screen. I wanted the steam train, I wanted the plane, I wanted the ocean liner and the Hispano-Suiza. It stretched everyone, it really made people bleed."" ABC TV, Film Victoria, Screen Australia and distributor All3Media funded the series.

Series 2
The second series was approved for Screen Australia funding in July 2012. Filming began on 18 February 2013 in Melbourne. The shoot wrapped on 9 August.

On 6 August 2012, Michael Idato from The Sydney Morning Herald said that the ABC had commissioned a second series of Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. Idato reported the second series would go into production later in the year. ABC's Head of Fiction, Carole Sklan, stated  ""ABC TV is delighted to be bringing a second series of Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries to the screen. The first series proved an instant hit with viewers and Every Cloud Productions has again assembled a stellar cast and team for 13 more exciting, intriguing, and unpredictable mystery stories.""

The second series is based on Greenwood's novels Dead Man's Chest, Unnatural Habits and various short stories. Cox commented that she and Eagger were ""thrilled"" that many of the cast and crew from the first series were returning. The second series premiered on 6 September 2013.

Series 3
In February 2014, ABC TV channel controller Brendan Dahill told David Knox from TV Tonight that a third series of Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries had yet to be commissioned. Dahill explainedThe position we are in is an embarrassment of riches—tons of successful series and at some point Carole (Sklan, Head of Fiction) and I need to sit down and work out how many of the successful shows we can afford to return, without standing still, and still doing new stuff. Woven into that we obviously need to know how much money we think we're going to have.Knox added that there were fears funds to the broadcaster could be cut. Colin Vickery, writing for news.com.au, reported that another reason Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries had not been green-lit for a third series was due to ABC wanting to attract a younger audience. Vickery also said that if the show was given a third series it would not air until 2015.

On 13 June 2014, it was confirmed that Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries had been commissioned for a third series. ABC renewed the series after a social media campaign run by fans of the show. The third series began shooting in mid-October 2014 in Melbourne and wrapped on 23 January 2015. Eagger told If Magazines Emily Blatchford that all of the cast would be returning, and admitted that the writers wanted to add some magic to the series and include an episode set in the military. She also hinted that there might be a wedding. Eagger added ""It's a tough time for the ABC so we are thrilled they are able to bring us back, and to have that support from Film Victoria as well."" The third series began airing from 8 May 2015.

Costumes
The costume designer for the series was Marion Boyce. She told ABC's Darren Smith that she loves the 20s and 30s and thought the opportunity to work on a show in her hometown (Melbourne) was ""fantastic."" Boyce had eight weeks' pre-production, but she said that she began putting stuff together early on. She stated ""After those eight weeks, we had 16 days to complete the next two episodes. It was a fast and furious process, and the series included circuses, bohemian nightclubs and the docks. Each episode is quite different from the rest."" The costume department included one cutter, one sewer, a costume coordinator and a buyer who was also an art finisher. Boyce called the team ""incredibly talented"", as they had to do a lot of different jobs. The team, Mandy Murphy and Gareth Blaha, the head of the ABC's Costume Department, along with two milliners, made some of the hats. Boyce and her team created around 120 costumes for the series, including sleepwear, daywear, nightwear and special-occasion outfits.

Boyce explained that while vintage pieces were incorporated into the series, the department designed the majority of costumes. Cox told Alexandra Spring from Vogue Australia that some of the costumes were sourced from eBay and vintage shops. Cox said ""Once you go back to the 1920s, things have either deteriorated or they are too small because the women were smaller, so it means a lot of it has to be made from scratch."" The fabrics were taken from Boyce's own collection and fabric stores in Melbourne and Sydney. The designer admitted that parting with some of the fabrics was difficult, as she had had some of them for around 25 years. Boyce told Smith that at the end of filming, the costumes that were hired were returned: those made from fabric bought by the ABC were sent back to them, and those made from fabrics out of Boyce's own collection came back to her.

Boyce explained that Phryne is ""completely fluid"" and has ""an extraordinary amount of energy"", so she wanted her outfits to move with her when she went from room to room. When it came to Dot, Boyce designed her wardrobe with her religion and position in society in mind. Dot's clothes are more buttoned up, so she does not show off her body parts. Boyce commented ""She was a really nice contrast to Phryne and a lot more conservative. Dot has nice tweeds and cardigans.""

In May 2016, Essie Davis acknowledged interest in playing Miss Fisher in a film. ""[We’re] just working out the ideas of how to make it bigger and better and more fabulous than the TV show,"" she said. Later that year, it was revealed that plans were afoot to produce a trilogy of Phryne Fisher films.

In April 2017, a photo was published on the official Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries Instagram account showing Essie Davis and Nathan Page holding advance copies of a film script titled Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears.

The Australian production company will assist in the making of this series. It will be scheduled on the Tencent Network in 2020.

Reception
While reviewing the first episode, David Brown from the Radio Times commented ""Just when you thought that all variations of the amateur-detective genre had been explored, along comes Miss Phryne Fisher, who sashays through the jazz clubs of late 1920s Ballarat, tackling villains with her pearl-handled pistol. The plot's hardly revolutionary, but it is worth watching for lead actress Essie Davis, with her sleek bob and killer cheekbones, who runs bad guys to ground with both wit and raunch.""

"János Erdélyi

János Erdélyi (1814 in Veľké Kapušany – January 23, 1868 in Sárospatak) was a Hungarian poet, critic, author, philosopher and ethnographist.

He was born in 1814 at Veľké Kapušany (Slovakia), in the county of Ung, and educated at the Protestant college of Sárospatak. In 1833 he removed to Pest, where he was, in 1839, elected member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He began his literary career with poems written in folk style (published in 1844).

His literary fame was made by his collection of Hungarian national poems and folk-tales, Magyar népköltési gyűjtemény, népdalok és mondák (""Collection of Hungarian Folklore, Folk Songs and Tales"", Pest, 1846–1847). This work, published by the Kisfaludy Society, was supplemented his ilnon Hiinaarian national ooetrv  afterwards partially translated into German by Stier (Berlin, 1851). Erdélyi also compiled for the Kisfaludy Society an extensive collection of Hungarian proverbs Magyar közmondások könyve (""Book of Hungarian Proverbs"", Pest, 1851),and was for some time editor of the Szépirodalmi Szemle (""Review of Polite Literature""). In 1848 he was appointed director of the national theatre at Pest; but after 1849 he resided at his native town. He died on 23 January 1868. A collection of folklore was published the year after his death, entitled A nép költészete: népdalok, népmesék és közmondások (""Poetry of the People: Folk Songs, Tales and Proverbs"", Pest, 1869). This work contains 300 national songs, 19 folk-tales and 7362 Hungarian proverbs.

As a philosopher he was an utopian socialist, influenced by Hegel.

Quotes
 ""It was said that education harms folk poetry, and it's true, but should we curse the Sun for banishing the dawn?"" (Mondatott: a műveltség árt a népköltészetnek, s ez igaz, de miért átkoznók a napot, hogy a hajnalt elűzi egünkről.)

"Singri (singiri)

Sengri is the last name or family name of the people who hail from a place called ""Sengiri"" in South India. There are many other places with same name as Sengiri, for example in Orissa (a state in North India), in Tanzania etc., which have no bearing on the last name as referred to in this article. Many people use the short form Singri instead of Singiri. This creates another conundrum, a place in Iran is called Sengri. Sengiri is a small hamlet close to Vellore, a city in the state of Tamil Nadu in South India.

The most famous landmark in Singiri is the Singri Temple or Singri Kovil/Koil. This temple, built in the honor of Lord Lakshmi Narasimha, is over 1000 years old and was built by the famous south Indian king and stalwart Rajavarman, who was the chief at that time. The temple sits on a hillock and far away from everything as though to reflect the need for being away from the very things that tie us to this earth. The main deity is in sitting position and is imposing to look at. The quality of workmanship is astounding.

Though originated there, Singiri's and Singri's have spread all over the world. They are highly educated or in business and are leading impressive life marked by peace and contribution to society.

"I2 Limited

i2 Limited was the UK-based arm of software company i2 Group which produced visual intelligence and investigative analysis software for military intelligence, law enforcement and commercial agencies. After a number of acquisitions, in 2011 it became part of IBM.

History
Founded in 1990 in Cambridge, i2 Limited sold products to more than 2,000 organizations in 149 countries, including most members of NATO. The company was founded by Mike Hunter and Dr Tim Spiers, who along with one other founding investor and employees of the company, held all shares until the company was acquired in 2005.

i2 developed software products for visualisation and analysis of disparate data sources to aid criminal investigation, and which were later also used by other branches of government (including anti-terrorism, military intelligence and defence), as well as commercial fraud.

Beginning with desktop Windows solution, the first products were the i2 Link Notebook and i2 Case Notebook, which would eventually be used by every police force throughout the UK, and were often the incentive for the first PC installed for use by analysts and investigators in a particular office.

Product capability and range was expanded from law enforcement, for use across industries including government, military and national defence and public safety, as well as commercial fraud prevention.

US headquarters (known as i2 Incorporated) was in McLean, Virginia. In 2005 the company was acquired by ChoicePoint.

In June 2008, i2 was acquired from ChoicePoint by Silver Lake Partners Sumeru fund for $185 million.

In July 2009, i2 merged with Knowledge Computing Corporation (KCC), makers of Coplink software. KCC was founded in 1998 in Tucson, Arizona.

In 2011, i2 received $10 million as an out of court settlement from Palantir. i2 sued Palantir in federal court alleging fraud, conspiracy, and copyright infringement over Palantir's algorithm. Shyam Sankar, Palantir’s director of business development, used a private eye company as the cutout for obtaining i2's code.

Products
The first products included the i2 Link Notebook and i2 Case Notebook.

The i2 Link Notebook enabled investigators to create entity relationship diagrams (a kind of visual database) allowing raw intelligence – largely textual reports (e.g. witness statements) – to be entered manually, revealing the relationships within the data and enabling data from different sources to be collated and graded. Automatic and manual layouts, and the ability to create, share, search, analyse and crucially print, even extremely large charts (sometimes tens of metres in length), dramatically improved law enforcement's ability to understand and communicate the status of investigations, and to direct and manage the process.

The i2 Case Notebook provided similar data entry and visualisation of time series data (i.e. laying events out along themes such as people and places), again able to handle very large data sets. Even with variable density timescales, due to the very large number of events uncovered in a large investigation, a single Case Chart could cover several walls in an office, or stretch tens of metres along a corridor.

While initially for manual data entry, these tools were then extended with add-on components to allow integration with databases. These database add-ons allowed mapping between a database entities (such as person, place, organisation, vehicle, asset, event) and the relationships between entities (such as associate, owns, related) and visual entities used to represent those records on the chart (person icon, place icon etc.). The first such database interface was to HOLMES 2 (Home Office Large Major Enquiry System), and subsequently many different SQL and even free text data sources. With database integration a query could be entered from within the visual representation of the data, the chart, either using a context menu on the chart background, or on a displayed entity (usually an icon). Query results were delivered directly to the visualisation, by adding elements to the chart, and any added entities and links were automatically laid out without disturbing the rest of the chart, for ease of understanding.  Investigators could explore a database with an initial search, and then incrementally expand to follow particular lines of thought. For example, by right clicking a person icon, choosing ""Expand"", and having new entities displayed as icons connected to the queried person, to show relationships drawn directly from the database. Thus revealing associations that would be difficult to spot through a traditional database query UI such as a person record that may or may not include information about known associates, vehicles, assets and so on, related to that person. This removed the need for any contextual knowledge by the investigator to infer likely relationships, and enabled even a new investigator to quickly explore new data or new hypotheses even with very large data sets.

The i2 Analyst's Notebook became the name for a packaged solution which included the i2 Link Notebook and i2 Case Notebook. This was part of the Human Terrain System, a United States Army program which embeds social scientists with combat brigades. An investigation into fraud in the U.S. Army was reported to have used Analyst's Notebook in 2009.
Analyst's Notebook was also used in the Army Distributed Common Ground System through 2011.

Other i2 products included: Analyst's Workstation, iBase, iBase Intellishare, iXv Visualizer, iBridge, iXa Search Service, TextChart, ChartReader and PatternTracer.  Its products deal with problems sometimes called ""big data"".

In September 2011, it was announced that IBM acquired i2 Limited.  The terms were not disclosed, but estimated at around $500 million.  At the time, it was estimated to have 350 employees.
The products were then sold under the IBM i2 brand, as part of its ""Smarter Cities"" campaign.

"CIHF-DT

CIHF-DT (branded on-air as Global Halifax) is the Global owned-and-operated television station, serving Nova Scotia that is licensed to Halifax. It broadcasts a high-definition digital signal on VHF channel 8 from a transmitter located on Washmill Lake Drive in Halifax.

Owned by Corus Entertainment, it is the sister station to CHNB-DT in Saint John, New Brunswick. The two stations share a studio on Gottingen Street in Downtown Halifax. This station can also be seen on EastLink TV channel 6, Bell Aliant TV channel 4, and Bell TV channel 204. On Shaw Direct, the channel is available on 329 (Classic) or 060 (Advanced), and in high definition on channel 050 (Classic) or 550 (Advanced). There is a high definition feed offered on Eastlink TV digital channel 602 and Bell Aliant TV channel 402.

History
CIHF-TV was launched on September 5, 1988, and was initially owned by the Irving family of Saint John, New Brunswick and their New Brunswick Broadcasting Company. It was co-owned with Saint John-based CHSJ-TV, the CBC Television affiliate for all of New Brunswick. The station initially had only one transmitter, in Halifax; it served the rest of Nova Scotia via cable. When MITV launched, it took all primetime American shows from CBC station CBHT—reportedly a prelude to the CBC dropping all primetime American programming nationwide.

It was a sister station to CIHF-TV-2 in Saint John. Both stations were branded as MITV (Maritimes Independent Television), and their schedules were almost identical. However, the stations offered separate newscasts to their respective provinces and opportunities for advertisers to buy ad space on one or both stations. Furthermore, although the Saint John station's callsign made it appear that it was a rebroadcaster of the Halifax station, both stations were separately licensed by the CRTC. At the time, MITV was the only over-the-air independent television station in the area, with studios and main operation centre in Halifax, and all other functions in Saint John. As MITV shared owners with CHSJ-TV, a popular joke in the Maritimes was that MITV stood for ""More Irving Television"".

In 1989, retransmitters were added in Bridgewater, Truro, and Wolfville. The transmitter network was expanded further in 1993 to include service to Shelburne, Sydney, New Glasgow, and Yarmouth.

After losing $5 million each year since sign-on, MITV was sold to Canwest on August 29, 1994. This was part of a three-way deal, which saw the CBC taking control of CHSJ-TV, moving it to Fredericton, and renaming it CBAT, making it a full CBC O&O. Later in the year, MITV moved its operational and business headquarters to Halifax.

In 1995, MITV's Saint John offices were moved out of the old CHSJ building and into a new facility in Brunswick Square. Within a year of new ownership and its resulting reorganization and marketing focus, the station became profitable for the first time in its short history. In 1997, when Canwest rebranded its stations as the Global Television Network, MITV became Global Maritimes.

Additional retransmitters signed on in 1998, in Mulgrave and Antigonish.

In October 2007, approximately forty employees at Global Maritimes were laid off as part of a wider restructuring of the Global Television Network and introduction of centralised news broadcast facilities.

On December 17, 2012, Global Maritimes officially began operations at its new home on Gottingen Street in Downtown Halifax. Previously, its operations were located on Akerley Blvd. in an industrial park in the Halifax suburb of Dartmouth.

In April 2013, CIHF was rebranded as Global Halifax, while sister station CIHF-2 in Saint John was rebranded as Global New Brunswick, marking the first time the stations have not used the same brand. The stations began producing separate nightly newscasts in addition to their already existing separate evening newscasts, and a new senior correspondent was hired for Global New Brunswick. The stations will continue to share news-gathering resources and anchors. Despite the separate branding, the two stations' non-news schedules remain virtually identical, except for separate idents and commercials.

News operation
Global Halifax airs three local newscasts a day from their Halifax studios: the flagship Global News at 6 at 6 p.m., Global News at 11 at 11 p.m., and Global News Morning from 6-9 a.m. on weekdays. Global News at 6 is followed by Global National at 6:30 p.m. On Saturdays and Sundays, Global Halifax and Global New Brunswick share a combined Global News at 6 and Global News at 11 under the Global Maritimes brand. All of these news programs are broadcast in 16:9 high definition from the Halifax studios.

Along with a growing number of other Global stations, CIHF has used a ""virtual"" studio since March 2008. The anchor sits behind a desk in front of a green screen, onto which a virtual reality studio is digitally inserted. Cameras and tapes are cued and controlled from a centralised control centre - which was originally in Vancouver, but was moved in August 2008 to Edmonton. A number of the redundancies made in October 2007 were directly attributable to the introduction of this new technology.

Global Maritimes also had a 5:30 p.m. newscast called the Early News, but was cancelled as of early 2007 to make way for a full hour late-night newscast. The Early News was the first attempt by Global Maritimes to compete against CTV Atlantic's flagship news magazine program Live at 5. Global also had a noon lifestyle show called The Noon Show (later called Global Noon), which was cancelled due to low ratings.

On June 8, 2011, the station announced that Ron Kronstein would become the senior anchor/producer for both the Nova Scotia and New Brunswick editions of the Evening News; Kronstein was the former host of Live at 5 on ATV (now CTV Atlantic) until 2003. On the same day, the station provided more details about its upcoming Morning News, and announced that up to a dozen new reporters, producers, and videographers would be hired at its bureaus in Halifax, Sydney, Moncton, Saint John, and Fredericton.

On January 28, 2013, Global Maritimes launched a three-hour weekday morning program (airing from 6-9 a.m.) titled the Morning News, as part of an expansion of local news programming on Global owned-and-operated stations across Canada.

Since 2016, Global Halifax has not had a weather anchor for their 6 p.m. newscast and instead relies on Global Toronto's chief meteorologist Anthony Farnell for the weather reports.

Global Halifax aired its last locally produced 6pm newscast on February 15, 2018. This came after the departure of anchor Ron Kronstein to Peterborough, Ontario to work for CHEX-DT. Global News at 6 will instead be anchored entirely from Toronto (meaning that after Global News Morning ends at 9am, the studio remains empty for the remainder of the day). As of August 2018, Global News has Reappeared in Halifax within Sarah Ritchie.

On-air Staff

Notable former on-air staff
 Allan Rowe - evening anchor (later a Nova Scotia MLA, deceased)
 Janet Stewart - evening anchor (now at CBWT-DT in Winnipeg)

Other programming
The Maritimes are located in the Atlantic Time Zone, which is one hour ahead of the Eastern Time Zone, where Global's CIII Toronto is located. In order to accommodate such a time zone difference and maximize simultaneous substitution opportunities with the American stations carried on cable, CIHF's primetime schedule deviates from that of most other Global O&Os, with some shows airing earlier in the evening, and occasionally on different nights, compared to other Global stations. (Global's stations in Alberta, which operate on Mountain Time but are in markets where the American network affiliates available on cable are on Pacific Time, usually have a very similar primetime schedule.)

Transmitters

The station operates the following rebroadcast transmitters.

"Sen Sōshitsu

is the traditional name carried by the head of the Urasenke family. Sen is the family name and Sōshitsu is the hereditary name assumed by the successor upon becoming iemoto of Urasenke. The first person in this line of the Sen family to use the name Sōshitsu was the youngest son of Sen no Sōtan; in other words, a great-grandson of Sen no Rikyū. He is generally known as Sensō Sōshitsu (仙叟宗室), without mention of the family name, and is counted as the fourth generation in the Urasenke family line. The current head of Urasenke is the sixteenth generation, Sen Sōshitsu XVI, who is distinguished by his tea name, Zabōsai.

The kanji character for sō, 宗, in the hereditary name may be interpreted to mean ""family core"". Like the head of Urasenke, the heads of other schools of Japanese tea ceremony also have hereditary names beginning with this kanji character. For example, the head of the Omotesenke school traditionally carries the name Sōsa, written 宗左, and the head of the Mushakōjisenke school is Sōshu, 宗守.

"Georgia and Alabama Railroad

The original Georgia and Alabama Railroad was based in Rome, GA, incorporated in 1853, and started initial rail construction in 1857.  In August 1866, the G&A officially consolidated with the Dalton and Jacksonville Railroad and the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad Company with the intent to create a consolidated rail system from Selma, AL to Dalton, GA.  The consolidated corporation was to do business under the name of the latter, but it  officially took the name Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad Company in December of that same year.  Still, in some cases, business continued under the name of Georgia and Alabama Railroad. For instance, in May 1868, a contract was executed to the Georgia and Alabama Railroad, leasing 100 African American convicts in the state of Georgia to work for the railroad company without pay.

The Georgia and Alabama Railroad is not to be confused with the Georgia and Alabama Railway, which was a different entity entirely, formed in 1895 and based in Savannah. However, due to the similarity in their names, the G&A Railway was often referred to as the G&A Railroad  until it became part of the Seaboard Air Line Railway ca. 1900.

In 1989, the next iteration of the Georgia and Alabama Railroad  was formed as a shortline railroad operating between Smithville, Georgia and White Oak, Alabama, . RailTex consolidated its holdings in the area into the Georgia Southwestern in 1995, and the Georgia & Alabama ceased to operate under that name. The rail system, however, is still in use by the Georgia Southwestern Railroad.

History

The Southwestern Railroad originally constructed the line west out of Smithville towards the Alabama state line, completing the railroad in 1860. The Southwestern was leased to the Central of Georgia in 1869 and completely integrated into the system in 1954. The remainder of the line into Alabama was constructed by the Vicksburg & Brunswick from Eufaula to Clayton, Alabama, and became part of the Central of Georgia. An extension to Ozark was later built, however, it was abandoned in 1977.

Eventually the Central of Georgia was acquired by the Southern, and later became part of Norfolk Southern. The line was cut back to White Oak February 28, 1986. The Georgia & Alabama railroad began operation on June 1, 1989 under the Thoroughbred Shortline Program between Smithville and White Oak.

Freight included peanuts, aggregates, pulpwood, and cement, which generated approximately 3,300 annual carloads for the line in 1995. Interchange was made with Norfolk Southern at Smithville, CSX Transportation at Dawson until 1990, and fellow RailTex subsidiary Georgia Southwestern at Cuthbert. After 1990, the railroad interchanged with the Georgia Great Southern at Dawson.

The Georgia & Alabama no longer existed in name after the division was merged into the Georgia Southwestern division of Railtex in 1995.

"Sin Nombre (2009 film)

Sin Nombre (English: ""Nameless"") is a 2009 Mexican-American adventure thriller film written and directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, about a Honduran girl trying to immigrate to the United States, and a boy caught up in the violence of gang life. 

Diego Luna and Gael García Bernal were executive producers on the Spanish-language film. Sin Nombre won awards for directing and cinematography at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.

Plot
Willy, nicknamed El Casper, is a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang and lives in Tapachula, a Mexican town near the border with Guatemala. He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another.

Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off.

Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still distraught Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers. He is finally accepted by Sayra's family but decides to leave the train while the others are sleeping. Unbeknownst to Casper, Sayra follows him off the train. Meanwhile, her father and uncle decide to continue the journey.

Traveling north on a car transport organized by a friend of Casper, Casper and Sayra barely escape a trap laid for them and enter an immigrant shelter, where Sayra sees a familiar face. She is informed that her father has died and her uncle has been caught. In disbelief, she rushes off to cry at the chapel, where Casper comforts her. They reach a river that constitutes the border to the United States. A coyote agrees to take them across one by one. Casper pays the man with his camera containing the cherished pictures of his murdered girlfriend and insists that Sayra go first. When she is halfway across, the gang appears and begins to chase Casper. Casper flees the pursuing gang but runs into Smiley, who shoots him once, then slowly two more times, the last of which is in the head. This allows time for the others to catch up. They then all proceed to empty their magazines into Casper in an execution-style killing, while Sayra struggles to hold on to the raft and screams in horror.

The closing scenes show Sayra phoning her father's new family from outside an American mall, her uncle setting off on another attempt to cross the border, and Smiley getting his lip tattooed as a sign of his loyalty to the gang.

Production
The film was mostly shot in Mexico City. Locations were found there resembling as closely as possible Tegucigalpa and the train station in Tapachula.

The film was also shot in Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. Several of the extras used in the film were actual migrants. Fukunaga said of working with them, ""I didn't have to tell them anything — they know how to sit on top of a train.""

According to IMDB, ""Cary Fukunaga spent two years researching the film, spending time with people on the trains and with gangsters in Central America. He also used two gang members to script edit making the slang and language as up to date and realistic as possible.""

Reception
The film currently holds an 88% ""fresh"" rating on the review website Rotten Tomatoes; the consensus states: ""Part harrowing immigration tale, part gangster story, this debut by writer/director Cary Fukunaga is sensitive, insightful and deeply authentic."" On Metacritic, the film has a 77/100 rating, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".

"James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond

James Butler, 2nd Earl of Ormond (4 October 133118 October 1382) was a noble in the Peerage of Ireland. He was Lord Justice of Ireland in 1359, 1364, and 1376, and a dominant political leader in Ireland in the 1360s and 1370s.

The son of James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond and Lady Eleanor de Bohun, James was born at Kilkenny Castle and given in ward on 1 September 1344 to Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond for the fine of 2,306 marks; and afterward to Sir John Darcy who married him to his daughter Elizabeth. He was usually called The Noble Earl, being a great-grandson, through his mother,  of King Edward I of England.
He died at Knocktopher Castle in Kilkenny, Leinster, Ireland.

Career
In 1362, he slew 600 of Mac Murrough's followers at Teigstaffen (County Kilkenny). On 22 April 1364, was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland to Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence: Clarence, from his  first arrival in Ireland, placed great trust in him, and for a few years it seems that as Deputy he was almost all-powerful. In the 1360s he clashed with Maurice FitzGerald, 4th Earl of Kildare. In 1364 the Irish House of Commons sent a delegation to England, headed by Kildare, to complain of misgovernment, and to ask for the removal of  ""corrupt"" officials, some of whom had links to Ormond. A number of these officials were removed, but Ormond's position was not seriously threatened.

He was Lord Justice by 24 July 1376, with a salary of £500 a year, in which office he was continued by King Richard II of England. On 2 April 1372, he was made constable of Dublin Castle, with the fee of £18 5s. a year. He was summoned to the Parliaments held by Richard II.

He died 18 October 1382 in his castle of Knocktopher (near which he had, in 1356, founded a Friary for Carmelite friars). He was buried in St. Canice's Cathedral, Kilkenny.

Marriage and Children
On 15 May 1346 he married Elizabeth Darcy, daughter of Sir John Darcy, Knight of Knaith (another Lord Justice of Ireland) and Joan de Burgh. They had five children:
 James Butler, 3rd Earl of Ormond (1362–1405).
 Thomas Butler, Justice of Cork 1359–1396
 Eleanor Butler 1350–1392, married Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond

"Australian Signals Directorate

Australian Signals Directorate (ASD; until 2013: Defence Signals Directorate, DSD) is the Australian government agency responsible for foreign signals intelligence, support to military operations, cyber warfare, and information security. ASD is part of the Australian Intelligence Community. ASD's role within UKUSA Agreement (Five Eyes) is to monitor SIGINT in South and East Asia. The ASD also houses the Australian Cyber Security Centre.

The unit was established in 1947 by executive order as the Defence Signals Bureau within the Department of Defence, and underwent several name changes until its current name ASD was adopted in 2013. ASD was converted to a statutory body by the Intelligence Services Act 2001. ASD is based in Canberra, at the Defence Department Headquarters at Russell Offices. As of February 2020, Rachel Noble is the Director-General of ASD, replacing Mike Burgess, who was appointed Director-General of Security in September 2019.

In April 2018, a proposal to empower ASD to collect intelligence on Australians was backed by Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton, but is strongly opposed by some in Cabinet who argue it is not necessary. Under legislation, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) are already allowed to seek assistance from ASD in conducting investigations on Australian citizens and businesses.

History
The Directorate has operated under a number of different names since its founding:

 1947 – Defence Signals Bureau established within the Department of Defence
 1949 – name changed to Defence Signals Branch
 1964 – name changed to Defence Signals Division
 1978 – name changed to Defence Signals Directorate on recommendation of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security (Hope Commission)
 2013 – name changed to Australian Signals Directorate

ASD commissioned an official history in 2019, which will cover the organisation's history from its establishment to 2001.

Roles and responsibilities
The principal functions of ASD are to collect and disseminate foreign signals intelligence (SIGINT) and to provide information security products and services to the Australian Government and Australian Defence Force (ADF), its foreign partners and militaries.

ASD operates at least three receiving stations: 
 the Australian Defence Satellite Communications Station (ADSCS), located at Kojarena, near Geraldton, Western Australia,
 the Shoal Bay Receiving Station, located at Shoal Bay, Northern Territory, and 
 a small station on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

ASD also maintains a workforce at Pine Gap in central Australia.

ADSCS and Shoal Bay are part of the United States signals intelligence and ECHELON analysis network. These stations also contribute signals intelligence for many Australian Government bodies, as well as the other UKUSA partners.

Electronic warfare operators in the Royal Australian Corps of Signals work closely with ASD. 7 Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare) at Borneo Barracks, , Queensland is also associated with ASD..

In addition, it has been reported that many Australian embassies and overseas missions also house small facilities which provide a flow of signals intelligence to ASD.

UKUSA Agreement (Five Eyes)
Australia joined the UKUSA Agreement in 1948, a multilateral agreement for cooperation in signals intelligence between Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The alliance is also known as the Five Eyes. Other countries, known as ""third parties"", such as West Germany, the Philippines, and several Nordic countries also joined the UKUSA community. As the Agreement was a secret treaty, its existence was not even disclosed to the Australian Prime Minister until 1973, when Gough Whitlam insisted on seeing it. The existence of the UKUSA Agreement was discovered by the Australian government during the 1973 Murphy raids on the headquarters of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). After learning about the agreement, Whitlam discovered that Pine Gap, a secret surveillance station close to Alice Springs, Australia, had been operated by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Pine Gap is now operated jointly by both Australia and the United States.

The existence of the Agreement was not disclosed to the public until 2005. On 25 June 2010, for the first time, the full text of the agreement was publicly released by the United Kingdom and the United States, and can now be viewed online. Under the agreement, ASD's intelligence is shared with UKUSA signals intelligence partner agencies: 
 the National Security Agency (NSA)United States, 
 the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)United Kingdom, 
 the Communications Security Establishment (CSE)Canada, and 
 the Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB)New Zealand.

Organisational structure
The Australian Signals Directorate is led by a Director-General and a Principal Deputy Director-General who oversee strategy. The ASD also comprises the Australian Cyber Security Centre, a Signals Intelligence and Network Operations Group, and a Corporate and Capability Group.

SIGINT and Network Operations Group
The Signals Intelligence and Network Operations Group is responsible for signals intelligence collection, analysis and production, and ASD’s network based access and effects operations. The Group comprises an Intelligence Division and a Network Operations and Access Division responsible for foreign signals intelligence and offensive cyber operations.

Defence SIGINT and Cyber Command
The Defence Signals-Intelligence (SIGINT) and Cyber Command (DSCC) was established in January 2018 by the Chief of the Defence Force consolidating all ADF personnel within the ASD within the Joint Cyber Unit and Joint SIGINT Unit. The Commander of the DSCC is responsible to the Head of Information Warfare under the Chief of Joint Capabilities to the Chief of the Defence Force. The Commander is currently Commodore James McCormack of the Royal Australian Navy who was previously the Director-General for Support to Military Operations within the Australian Signals Directorate.

"Canada v Schmidt

Canada v Schmidt, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 500, is a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada on the applicability of fundamental justice under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on extradition.  While fundamental justice in Canada included a variety of legal protections, the Court found that in considering the punishments one might face when extradited to another country, only those that ""shock the conscience"" would breach fundamental justice.

Background
The defendant was a Canadian citizen named Helen Susan Schmidt, who along with her son Charles Gress and his friend Paul Hildebrand had kidnapped a young girl in Cleveland, Ohio.  Schmidt claimed to believe the girl was her granddaughter and that the girl's biological mother kept her in a home ill suited for a child.  Helen Schmidt then lived with the girl for two years in New York City before her arrest in 1982.  She was charged with kidnapping (a federal offence in the United States) and with child-stealing (an offence in Ohio).  That same year she was acquitted of kidnapping, but she fled to Canada before her state trial commenced.  She was captured in Ontario and was prepared to be extradited.

While being charged for child-stealing after having been acquitted of kidnapping would not violate the double jeopardy clause in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as the states are not bound by this amendment, Schmidt fought the extradition as a violation of double jeopardy rights under section 11(h) of the Canadian Charter.

Decision
The majority decision was written by Justice Gerard La Forest.  After the Supreme Court found it had jurisdiction to review the case, it considered whether extradition law aside from Charter law was violated.  Under extradition law, a hearing in Canada would ascertain if there was sufficient evidence of a crime that could be criminal in Canada as well as in the other nation.  It was argued that the extradition hearing should guard against double jeopardy, since this was an essential right in Canadian law.  However, the hearing is not a trial, and the Supreme Court decided that arguments about double jeopardy are a defence that would be more suited for a trial.  The case Re Burley (1865) was cited to demonstrate that Canada should trust the receiving country to carry out the trial.

Moving on to consider section 11(h) of the Charter, the Court considered the argument that the crimes of kidnapping and child-stealing were too similar.  The Court noted that while the Canadian government's decisions in extradition are bound by the Charter under section 32, the actions of a foreign government are not.  This was relevant to section 11(h), since its rights are held against trials and the Canadian government would not be conducting the trial.  The Court went on to argue many other rights under section 11 would also be irrelevant to extradition.  For example, section 11 guarantees the presumption of innocence, but in practice Canada already extradites persons to countries that do not presume innocence.

Section 6 of the Charter, which provides mobility rights for Canadian citizens, was not considered because the Court had already dealt with the issue in Re Federal Republic of Germany and Rauca and found extradition could be a justified limit on rights against exile.

Finally, the Court considered section 7 of the Charter, which guarantees the right to life, liberty and security of the person, except when a deprivation of these rights is in accordance with fundamental justice.  The Court noted that the executive government's decisions to extradite, the extradition hearing and even the treaty could be subject to section 7.  The extradition itself could violate section 7 by putting a person at risk of having his or her rights breached.

The Court found that punishments in another country might be so excessive that the Canadian government should not put persons at risk by extraditing them there.  For example, torture would be unacceptable, and to make this point the Court cited Altun v. Germany (1983), a case considered by the European Commission on Human Rights.  In general, a potential punishment that ""shocks the conscience"" will violate fundamental justice in extradition cases.  However, the Court urged some deference to the executive government in these cases.  Additionally, the fact that a foreign justice system would be very different from Canada's would not necessarily make it unjust.  Compared to regular operations in another country, the variety of guarantees under fundamental justice in Canada could be seen as ""finicky,"" and thus they need not be considered in extradition cases.  The presumption of innocence was one right the Court identified that if breached would not shock the conscience, even though it is part of fundamental justice in Canada.  This shocked conscience theory would also be less disruptive to efforts to ensure fugitives meet justice.

Ultimately, however, Schmidt lost her case.  While double jeopardy is a part of fundamental justice in Canada, La Forest wrote, ""I do not think our constitutional standards can be imposed on other countries.""  The majority found that the charge would be in accordance with ""traditional procedures"" in Ohio.  Finally, it found that ""It is interesting that, as we saw, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that successive prosecutions at the federal and state level do not automatically offend against the due process clause, the spirit and content of which bears some resemblance to s. 7 of the Charter, although the courts would act to prevent oppressive behaviour.""

Concurrence

Lamer
A concurrence was written by Justice Antonio Lamer, who agreed some potential punishments in extradition might breach fundamental justice.  However, he felt that when one faces extradition hearings, one is a ""person charged with an offence"" and thus section 11 should apply.  In an extradition hearing, a person should therefore have legal rights under the Charter, as the foreign government might now allow consideration of similar rights.  Nevertheless, Lamer too would have decided against Schmidt because he felt kidnapping and child-stealing were sufficiently different crimes.

Wilson
An opinion was also given by Justice Bertha Wilson, who also would have ruled against Schmidt.  She argued that a citizen ""clearly can"" claim rights under the Charter in an extradition hearing.  Wilson felt the claim to rights under sections 11(h) and 7 were not made against Ohio but against the extradition court's decision that Schmidt should be held in prison in Canada before the government made a decision to extradite her.  Still, Wilson decided that Schmidt ""failed to establish that the offence in Ohio is the same offence as the offence under the United States Code.""

Aftermath
The case has been cited in a number of subsequent extradition cases, including Kindler v. Canada (1991), in which it was found potential execution would not shock the conscience, and later United States v. Burns (2001), which overturned Kindler.  In Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2002), the Court ruled a possibility of torture would shock the conscience.  However, the use of the shocked conscience doctrine has not gone without criticism.  Professor Peter Hogg, in noting how the definition of fundamental justice has been ambiguous and that the courts have taken on ""enormous discretion,"" argues a shocked conscience is particularly difficult to measure.  He writes that cruel and unusual punishment (prohibited by section 12 of the Charter) should obviously be shocking potential punishments.  However, he observes that some potential punishments considered cruel and unusual in Canada have been considered acceptable in extradition.  Thus, Hogg notes that some punishments considered ""cruel and unusual, ...are not shocking or unacceptable!""

"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman (season 3)

The third season of Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman originally aired between September 17, 1995 and May 12, 1996, beginning with ""We Have a Lot to Talk About"".

The series loosely follows the comic philosophy of writer John Byrne, with Clark Kent as the true personality, and Superman as a secondary disguise. As the show's title suggests, it focuses as much on the relationship between Clark Kent and Lois Lane as on the adventures of Clark's alter-ego. The central characters in season 3 are Dean Cain as Clark Kent/Superman, Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane, Lane Smith as Perry White, Eddie Jones as Jonathan Kent, K Callan as Martha Kent, and Justin Whalin as Jimmy Olsen.

Season three would go on to be the most successful season of Lois & Clark in its run. The show averaged at least 15 million viewers per episode, and ranked 44th for the season. In the premiere episode, Lois revealed that she had recently learned Clark's secret identity. Only later in the seventh episode of the season, ""Ultra Woman"", did Lois finally accept Clark's proposal. The long-anticipated wedding was put off to coincide with the characters' marriage in the comics, which led to many storylines designed to delay and interrupt the wedding on the TV series.

Another controversy erupted when ABC announced that the wedding would actually take place Valentine's Day weekend, even sending out heart-shaped ""wedding invitations"" to ABC News staff, only to present viewers with a bogus wedding, in which Clark unwittingly married a clone of Lois who was developed by a mad scientist whose creations are required to ingest frogs periodically as nourishment. This started a special five-part story, with Lois being kidnapped by Lex Luthor who had put the clone in her place. And later with Lois suffering amnesia after a sharp hit on the head and needing to regain her memory.

The wedding of Lois and Clark was scheduled and prepared by DC's Superman comics team for release during what would have worked out to be the third season of Lois and Clark. The ongoing Superman comics are not affiliated with television or movies and move in their own direction at their own pace. When the comic book wedding became known to the producers of the Lois and Clark television series, they asked the DC Comics team to postpone the wedding issue as they were planning to marry Lois and Clark in their fourth season and it would help them if the comic book wedding were to coincide with their television program. The DC comics team agreed to postpone their wedding issue.

 Jake Clawson (alias: Razor) (voiced by Barry Gordon) - The smaller size but older member of the SWAT Kats, who is a confident leader and an ace mechanical genius. He designed the various gadgets and advanced weaponry used in the Turbokat, and he serves as the radar interceptor and weapons control officer, or RIO, in the Turbokat. He is a martial arts master. He is the more measured, and restrained, of the two kats. In ""Razor's Edge"", he lost his self-confidence in his fighting because he had ""hurt"" two pedestrians, but recovered from this upon discovering it was a set-up by Dark Kat. He loved the late night show with David Litterbin (a pun on David Letterman). His catchphrases are ""SWAT Kats! To the Jet!"" and ""Bingo!""
 Chance Furlong (alias: T-Bone) (voiced by Charlie Adler) - The larger size but a bit young member of the SWAT Kats and pilot of the Turbokat jet. T-Bone is one of the best pilots in the SWAT Kat universe, as seen in ""Cry Turmoil."" He is Jake/Razor's best friend, ultimate rival, and an ally. He loves aerial warfare history as seen in ""The Ghost Pilot"" and Scaredy Kat cartoons. It was revealed in ""The Ci-Kat-A"" that he had a strong dislike of bugs that he eventually overcame. In ""Mutation City"", it was revealed that he was unable to swim, though later in the episode, he learned, and rescued an unconscious Razor from drowning. He is very protective of his partner and the Turbokat and gets extremely upset if anything happens to either. Chance is also the more daring of the two—in his willingness to take chances (especially when in the TurboKat). Chance commonly flew the Turbokat out of tough situations, refusing to eject, and coaxing his ""baby""—the TurboKat—to perform.

Supporting characters
 Mayor Manx (voiced by Jim Cummings imitating W.C. Fields) - The Mayor of Megakat City for 10 terms. He spent nearly all of his time working on his golf game; as Callie once stated, ""he hasn't done an ounce of paperwork in years!"" He also tried to rent out Megakat Towers to investors; a first-season running gag had the building constantly being ruined in ""Destructive Nature"" and ""The Ci-Kat-A."" He was descended from a famous and brave fighter pilot named the Blue Manx who was the sworn enemy of Red Lynx, as revealed in ""The Ghost Pilot."" But in contrast to his ancestor, Mayor Manx was a coward who usually ran and hid whenever danger arose, but he did act bravely and shoot down the ghost of the Red Lynx in the same episode–-doing so only after Razor goaded him into action on the grounds that he would not be re-elected if he did not fight back. His name was derived from the Manx cat breed.
 Calico ""Callie"" Briggs (voiced by Tress MacNeille) - The Deputy Mayor of Megakat City and the one who did the real work of City Hall. The SWAT Kats' biggest supporter, she had a radio communicator which enabled her to call them directly when danger threatened the city. Although she did not know who they were, Callie usually trusted her life to the SWAT Kats if required. In ""The Dark Side of the SWAT Kats"", her equivalent in a parallel universe was an evil ally of Dark Kat. In ""Bride of the Pastmaster"", her ancestor Queen Callista was leader of the medieval kingdom of ""Megalith City."" Though Razor had a crush on her (more evident in the fact that even her ancestor seemed to favor Razor over T-Bone), likewise, she also seemed to favor Jake and only saw Chance as a friend. Her name was a pun on Calico cat.
 Enforcers - The Enforcers are the militarized police force of Megakat City.
 Commander Ulysses Feral (voiced by Gary Owens) - Head of the Enforcers, Feral had a strong and obvious dislike for the SWAT Kats, whom he considered ""reckless vigilantes."" He had worked with the SWAT Kats when the situation called for it such as in ""Katastrophe"" and ""A Bright and Shiny Future"", but he more often called on his men saying ""The Enforcers will handle this"" and ""Get me chopper back-up!"" He is solely responsible for the birth of the SWAT Kats. When Jake and Chance were  Enforcers, they were kicked out of the force for their disobedience during an aerial assault against Dark Kat and forced to work at the city junk yard to paid off a hefty debt from the damage of Enforcer HQ....all of which Feral himself was also responsible for. He sees them as nothing more than ""ruthless vigilantes"", but is likely jealous because they make him and the Enforcers look very incompetent. He would go as far as to issue an ""arrest on sight"" if the duo would go too far. Despite his ego, he has a strict sense of justice and tries his best to battle the threats that plague Megakat City. It is uncertain if he has any respect for the SWAT Kats. When the Metallikats offered to reveal the identities of the SWAT Kats in exchange for their freedom, he rejected the offer quoting ""I don't deal with scum.""
 Lt. Felina Feral (voiced by Lori Alan) - Commander Ulysses Feral's niece (she was the daughter of Feral's brother) first appeared in season 2's ""Mutation City"" as a new female heroine. Being something of a reckless hot-head herself, she appreciated the help of the SWAT Kats and would work openly with them. Feral himself faced something of a dilemma over her: trying to keep her out of danger but not show any favorable treatment. Furthermore, he has stated that Felina was too good an officer to eject off the force, and his brother would never speak to him again. She was also a very skilled pilot, as seen in ""When Strikes Mutilor"" and ""Cry Turmoil."" She wouldn't take ""No"" for an answer, a fact to which T-Bone once remarked, ""You are one stubborn she-kat!""
 Lt. Commander Steel (voiced by Hal Rayle) - A high-ranking Enforcer who constantly seeks to replace Commander Feral as leader of the Enforcers. He is actually a bit of a coward and shows no real leadership skills, simply sitting at his (Feral's) desk and dismissing people even if they were victims of a crime. He is also prone to getting airsick. During one mission which involved fighting Dark Kat, Feral forces Steel to ride co-pilot in a battle. Steel gets airsick and ends up vomiting in the cockpit. Feral notices this and responses with heavy disdain ""And you want my job."" Steel was later dropped by season two. But in season two, he appears in two episodes ""A Rivalry Reunion"" and ""Katastrophe Again"". 
 Sgt. Talon (voice by Ed Gilbert in season one and Jim Cummings in season two) - One of Feral's top Enforcer officers. He says little and carries out Feral's orders without question. He serves as Feral's second in command in the field whenever Felina isn't around.
 Ann Gora (voiced by Candi Milo) - The star reporter for Kats Eye News. She was usually on the scene whenever the SWAT Kats were in action and had been rescued by the SWAT Kats in ""The Ci-Kat-A"" and ""Caverns of Horror."" Besides Deputy Mayor Briggs, Ann had also warned the SWAT Kats (Razor and T-Bone)  of dangerous situations a few times. Her name was a pun on the Turkish Angora.
 Jonny K. (voiced by Mark Hamill) - Ann Gora's cameraman who often cared about Ann's safety, whenever she got herself in danger. He spoke very little, and was seen always wearing sunglasses and a red baseball cap. His largest roles were in ""The Ci-Kat-A"" and ""Caverns of Horror"", where he helped the SWAT Kats along with Ann Gora. A running gag is that Johnny's camera is always destroyed.
 Al (voiced by Frank Welker in ""The Wrath of Dark Kat"", Rob Paulsen in ""Night of the Dark Kat"") - Al is the pilot of the Kat's Eye News helicopter. Although he is a professional at his job, he often shows contempt for Ann Gora's reckless nature. Several times, he refused to fly the helicopter near dangerous areas despite Ann's nagging, such as when Hard Drive stole the Turbokat.
 Dr. Abby Sinian (voiced by Linda Gary) - Archaeologist and curator of the Megakat City Museum of History. Smart, beautiful and brave as well as tops in her field, Dr. Sinian doesn't hesitate to get down and dirty when working an archeological site or panic when in danger (encounters with a prehistoric cat, Pastmaster, mummies, etc.). Unlike most scientists in her field, Dr. Sinian does not limit herself to the factual and tangible; she is an expert on the supernatural and the occult and often proves useful in situations involving villains like the Pastmaster. As Curator of the Megakat Museum of History, Dr. Sinian often proves to be an excellent informational resource for when creatures and villains from the past manage to make a comeback in the modern realm. Her name was a pun on the  Abyssinian cat.
 Professor Hackle (voiced by George Hearn) - Professor Hackle was the scientist who spent his life as a military weapons researcher for Pumadyne. He later renounced his profession and turned to the civilian sector. Professor Hackle was the one who built the robot bodies of Mac and Molly Mange and transplanted their brains into them. In ""The Deadly Pyramid"", Professor Hackle created Cybertron, a friendly and very brave little robot to help the SWAT Kats. In ""Bright & Shiny Future,"" a future version of him restored the damaged Turbokat to its flying condition and subsequently reprogrammed the Machines who had taken over the city after Razor and T-Bone destroyed the Robotics HQ.

Villains
 Dark Kat (voiced by Brock Peters) - Dark Kat was the main arch-enemy of the SWAT Kats. He is very large, intelligent and evil purple-skinned kat that wears a black and red hooded coat. Dark Kat wanted to destroy Megakat City to create a new lawless town called ""Dark Kat City"". Being highly intelligent and calculating, Dark Kat often anticipated his foes' actions with great accuracy, and it was a recurring theme throughout the series that all of his hideouts are rigged with explosives. He first appeared in ""The Wrath of Dark Kat."" His attempt to bomb the Enforcer headquarters indirectly led to Jake and Chance's employment termination from the Enforcers and the birth of the SWAT Kats. He was the only main villain who never got an origin story of his own in the series. However, some promotional material for the series depicted him as being a judge in Megakat City by day and he would use this to hide his criminal life. This was never referred to in show.
 Creeplings (vocal effects provided by Charlie Adler) - Small pink bat-like creatures that were extremely vicious and appeared to be protected from radiation. They served as Dark Kat's primary henchmen.
 Dr. Viper (voiced by Frank Welker) - Dr. Elrod Purvis was a greedy scientist who worked at Megakat Biochemical Labs. He tried to steal an experimental regenerative formula he and his idealistic colleague Dr. N. Zyme were developing. He became covered in the formula when he fell down the stairs and the shock ultimately killed him. The chemicals revived him from death, mutating Purvis into a sociopathic half-cat, half-snake creature. With expertise in the fields of biology, genetics and robotics, he sought to turn Megakat City into ""Megaswamp City"" and transform the residents into mutants like himself. Dr. Viper first appeared in ""The Giant Bacteria"" where he was able to turn Morbulus into a bacteria monster. Dr. Viper was by far the deadliest enemy of the SWAT Kats and he and his creatures murdered a number of innocent people (including his former colleague Dr. N. Zyme and even one of Dark Kat's Creeplings) in the series. The only weapon he has on hand is his tail which he uses to smack his enemies away. He made a final appearance in ""Mutation City"" where he floods Megakat City with a slimy orange ooze created from the experimental formula Katalyst X-63. He even douses himself with the formula and turns into a giant Godzilla-like monster and rampages through the city. In this state, he attempted to stop Razor from using the anti-mutagen, but ultimately failed and was caught in the anti-mutagen's explosion which turned everything to its normal state. He was similar to the Spider-Man villain Lizard.
 Mac and Molly Mange (voiced by Neil Ross and April Winchell) - The husband-and-wife criminal team similar to Bonnie and Clyde, Mac and Molly Mange both used to head the most notorious mob syndicate in Megakat City. They drowned when the boat they were in was hit by a larger boat while attempting to escape from Alkatraz prison. Their bodies were found by Professor Hackle's robot servants and their minds were placed in the brains of robots. Mac was supposed to be a robot-chauffeur (though ironically, he was a poor driver) and Molly was to be a robot-maid, but instead remained criminals and took on the moniker of The Metallikats. They first appeared in ""The Metallikats"" where they kill Katscratch, a rival mob boss who took over their territory, and injured the rest of his gang. They had a vendetta against Mayor Manx for denying their parole request, though it turned out that Callie had done it as the mayor was too busy to handle it. Mac and Molly often bickered with each other, but do love each other and would come to each other's aid when one was in trouble. Mac was considered the ""muscle"" of the team while Molly was considered the ""brains."" In ""Metal Urgency"", they both discovered the secret identities of the SWAT Kats. However, this knowledge was erased when Commander Feral deactivated them with Professor Hackle's EMP device in the same episode as Commander Feral quotes ""I don't deal with scum"" when they offered to reveal the SWAT Kats' identities to him. In ""Katastrophe"", their remains were salvaged by the Creeplings when Dark Kat collaborated with Dr. Viper in a plot to eliminate the SWAT Kats. Dark Kat had special collars placed on the Metallikats' necks which give them a shock when they don't do what Dark Kat says. They were sent to capture Mayor Manx and Callie Briggs which was a success. This ended up drawing the SWAT Kats and Commander Feral to the villains' hideout at an abandoned offshore cannery. When the Metallikats turned against Dark Kat, he discovered that Dr. Viper deactivated the collars. In a battle between the villains, Commander Feral, and the SWAT Kats, the villains were defeated and were thought to have been destroyed. In ""A Bright and Shiny Future"", the SWAT Kats follow Pastmaster into a future where Pastmaster had reassembled the Metallikats and had taken over the robots. The Metallikats turn on Pastmaster and steal his watch. With help from Commander Feral, Felina Feral, Professor Hackle, and the Pastmaster, the SWAT Kats defeated the Metallikats as Pastmaster reclaims his watch. In ""Unlikely Alloys"" the Metallikats attempt to rob a mint, but the Swat Kats intervene, resulting in Molly being severely injured and Mac losing his arm. Mac steals Dr. Greenbox's Micro Brain Repair Unit to repair himself and Molly. However the invention gains sentience and assimilates various appliances and weapons, dubbing itself Zed. Though Zed was at first compliant to the Metallikats, it decided they were inferior and assimilated Mac. Molly aided the SWAT Kats and Dr. Greenbox to stop Zed but upon realizing Mac was connected to Zed and would shut down upon Zed's destruction, the Swat Kats were forced to allow Zed to assimilate Molly. When Zed was destroyed the Metallikats were presumed deceased but survived, though Mac was fused with a food processor. In some ways, they are quite similar to the Superman villain Metallo. Their name is a pun on the thrash/heavy metal band, Metallica.
 The Pastmaster (voiced by Keene Curtis) - An undead sorcerer from the Dark Ages who tried to conquer his home city. He traveled through time using his magical mechanical pocket watch, and with his magical spell book ""The Tome of Time"", he was able to summon extinct or mythical creatures such as dinosaurs and dragons. He despised all forms of modern technology and was constantly trying to rid the world of it and return things to the former ""glory"" of his beloved Dark Ages. He first appeared in ""The Pastmaster Always Rings Twice."" In ""A Bright and Shiny Future"" the SWAT Kats were drawn into a future where the Metallikats together with the Pastmaster had created a Terminator-inspired future where machines ruled over katkind. All the Pastmaster really wanted was to go back home to his own time. He was occasionally shown to lust after Callie Briggs (the ""spitting,"" or spirit-and-body, image of her ancestor Queen Callista (As seen in ""Bride of the Pastmaster"" when the SWAT Kats travel back into the Dark Ages), who is the Pastmaster's ancient crush). He repeatedly captured her and ""asked"" her to marry him, but Callie would have none of it. He apparently met his demise in ""The Deadly Pyramid"" where during the collapse of the pyramid, he was seen falling towards a pit of molten lava.
 Hard Drive (voiced by Rob Paulsen) - Hard Drive is a technological thief who generally dons his ""Surge Coat"" when working. This coat gives him a number of abilities focused around electricity and electronics, as the name suggests. Primarily seen is his ability to transform himself into electrical energy, thus allowing him to travel through power, telephone, and computer lines. Besides this, he appears to be able to manipulate electronic devices with a simple jolt of electricity from his fingertip and download and delete data quickly with a ""plug"" on his coat. He works for whoever pays him the most. However, he is powerless without his surge coat and is actually very scrawny. Prior to his first appearance, he apparently hijacked teller machines. His first appearance was in ""Night of the Dark Kat"" where he breaks into a top secret military research center and stolen defense secrets. The SWAT Kats track his surge signal and subdue him in a special insulated missile. After being taken to a jail cell, Hard Drive is broken out by Dark Kat and his Creeplings. Freeing Hard Drive from the insulated missile, Dark Kat forces Hard Drive to team up with him to help capture, discredit and destroy the SWAT Kats using the Turbokat to hold the city hostage. Hard Drive is defeated when T-Bone destroyed his Surge Coat. Both of them were turned over to the Enforcers. In ""Metal Urgency"", Hard Drive had hijacked a heavily armed tank from Pumadyne and its forcefield prevented the Enforcers' attacks from getting through. The SWAT Kats managed to disable Hard Drive with a Scrambler Missile. In ""SWAT Kats Unplugged"", Hard Drive steals an anti-weapons scrambler from Pumadyne scientist Dr. Ohm in a plot to steal the gold being transferred to Megakat Mint. After hijacking a state-of-the-art jet, Hard Drive was pursued by the SWAT Kats and apprehended. Hard Drive was similar to the Spider-Man villain Electro.
 Morbulus (voiced by Jim Cummings) - An evil pilot who literally has eyes in the back of his head, appearing in ""The Giant Bacteria."" He bombs oil refineries with his fighter jet until defeated by the SWAT Kats. After giving the SWAT Kats the slip, he is found by Dr. Viper near a sewer pipe and mutated into a grotesque purple bacteria monster that divides into more of itself (in the style of amoeba) when hit. All of the bacteria monsters (there were three) were killed by the SWAT Kats using electricity with Burke and Murray cleaning up the bacteria monsters' remains. Morbulus' name was originally going to be ""Occulus,"" but it was changed at the last minute due to possible legal problems with Marvel Comics.
 Katscratch (voiced by Jim Cummings) - A gangster who used to work for Mac and Molly Mange. He was known for smuggling catnip, which is seen as a narcotic in the SWAT Kats universe, in a trade with Fango. His name appears to be a reference to the song ""Cat Scratch Fever."" When Mac and Molly Mange returned as the Metallikats, they killed Katscratch for his betrayal.
 Fango (voiced by Neil Ross) - Katscratch's business partner who was badly injured in the explosion caused by Mac Mange's exploding cigar. As the paramedics prepared to take him to the hospital, he informed Commander Feral that the Metallikats are Mac and Molly Mange and were advancing to their next target: Mayor Manx.
 Mobsters (voiced by Jim Cummings, Charlie Adler, and Ed Gilbert) - Four identical looking mobsters who worked for Katscratch up until his death. Katscratch's henchmen swore their loyalty to the Metallikats only for them to dismiss them as the Metallikats make up their own gang. Not much is known about them other than they alongside Fango were badly injured in the fire from Mac Mange's exploding cigar.
 Rex Shard (voiced by John Vernon) - A convict sentenced to life in prison, who was accidentally exposed to the radiation of an experimental diamond mining machine created by Dr. Greenbox when testing it out in a mine for Warden Cyrus Meece (whom Shard always hated). He turned into a crystal colossus and had the ability to turn anything he touched into crystal. He was stopped by the SWAT Kats, reverted to normal, and was sent back to prison. He appeared only in ""Chaos in Crystal"", but was supposed to appear in the proposed 3rd-season episode ""Cold War"" as a weather-controlling mutant warrior with plans to freeze Megakat City after diving into an experiment energy source.
 The Ci-Kat-A (voiced by Frank Welker) - A race of cicada-like aliens with a mild resemblance to a cat that can transform a creature into a Ci-Kat-A with a bite. A Ci-Kat-A queen left its home planet and cocooned itself in space. The queen stowed away on a Masa space shuttle which landed on Earth. At a Masa lab the queen infected Dr. Harley Street, other scientists, and the guards. The queen laid several eggs which hatched into Ci-Kat-A drones while Dr. Street fed the Ci-Kat-A radiation from the site, though the queen needed more. The Swat Kats and the Enforcers arrived to save the Kat's Eye News crew, which had been trapped inside the building. The Swat Kats rescued the crew and Feral blew up the lab. However the queen escaped from the lab with Dr. Street to go to the Metrokat Nuclear Power Plant. The queen succeeded and feasted on the radiation and transformed into a giant. The queen made a hive at Metrokat Tower, where the drones assimilated some Enforcer pilots. When Feral used flamethrowers to destroy the hive the queen attempted to flee. The queen grabbed Razor, but T-Bone managed to tie the queen up and save Razor. The queen was then crushed by a pies of the burning Megakat Tower.
 Dr. Harley Street (voiced by Robert Ridgely) - Dr. Harley Street was a brilliant astronomer who was bitten by an alien insect creature and later mutated into one himself. Dr. Harley Street tried to help the alien queen to achieve its full power by letting her eat the radioactive material from Megakat Nuclear Power Plant. Dr. Harley Street was thrown out of the Megakat Tower by Razor. He only appeared in ""The Ci-Kat-A"", but was supposed to appear in the unfinished episode ""Doctors of Doom"" where Dr. Harley Street resurfaces and teams up with Dr. Viper to create havoc in Megakat City.
 Madkat (voiced by Roddy McDowall) – Ages ago, Madkat was an insane and powerful court jester who was replaced. He sought revenge on the jester who replaced him and the knight, queen and king who imprisoned him in a jack-in-a-box. Centuries later, once brilliant comedian-turned-asylum patient Lenny Ringtail escapes and fuses with the jester's spirit after finding the jack-in-a-box in a store and gains the ability to warp reality at a whim, this makes him virtually unstoppable and his only weakness is the small balls at the end of his fools cap. Together they take revenge upon those who symbolized the ones' who imprisoned Madkat. He captured David Litterbin {Jester}, Mayor Manx {King}, Callie Briggs {Queen}, and Commander Feral {Knight}. After T-Bone destroys Madkat by hitting his weak spot, Ringtail's sanity and career were restored after he is knocked out by Razor and Commander Feral. Lenny guest-starred on the David Litterbin show to promote his bestselling book ""Madkat and Me."" He appeared only in ""Enter the Madkat"". This character is loosely based on television comedian Jay Leno and comedian Lenny Bruce, as a rival to David Litterbin (Letterman), and even has a catchphrase (""Here's Ringtail"") spoken just like ""Jay Leno"" on The Tonight Show.
 The Red Lynx (voiced by Mark Hamill) – The ghost of a Mega War II flying ace who pilots a red biplane. T-Bone says he learned a lot about dogfighting from studying the Red Lynx's maneuvers. The Red Lynx stole a prototype plane from the Enforcers and tried to kill Mayor Manx, who was the great-grandson of his greatest opponent, the Blue Manx, but in the end, the SWAT Kats, along with Mayor Manx sent him to his doom by destroying the plane. His skill in flying in such is that even in his old museum biplane he was able to cause serious damage to the Turbokat. He only appeared in ""The Ghost Pilot"" and is a parody of the Red Baron.
 Lord Mutilor (voiced by Michael Dorn) – Mutilor is a giant lobster-like alien warlord who attacked Earth using a stolen Aquian spaceship to steal all of its water so he could sell it to a desert world. In the end, the SWAT Kats were able to kill him by blowing up his spaceship and saving Captain Grimalken and his crew from harm. His name comes from a goldfish that Lance Falk's friend once owned. He appears only in ""When Strikes Mutilor"".
 First Officer Traag (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith) - Mutilor's henchman who heads up his army.
 Alien Guard Captain (voiced by Jim Cummings) - The leader of Mutilor's guard corps.
 Alien Guards and Pilots - Mutilor's goons who crew his ship and fly his fighter craft.
 Turmoil (voiced by Kath Soucie) – A villainous she-kat that wants to conquer Megakat City by controlling the airspace, with the help of her flying fortress, the Sky-Lion, and her squadron of female pilots, if the citizens of Megakat City don't pay her due first. She tried to seduce T-Bone, by showing him some of the modified airplanes that supposedly never went as far as the drawing board. But in the end, T-Bone fooled her. With the help of Razor, T-Bone put Turmoil in prison. T-Bone later sent a letter to Turmoil's prison cell. Writer Lance Falk created Turmoil because besides Molly Mange, there were no other female villains. Her name is an anagram of ""Mutilor"" from When Strikes Mutilor. She appears only in ""Cry Turmoil"", though she was scheduled to appear in the unfinished episode ""Turmoil II: The Revenge"" where she, alongside some female inmates, escape from prison and use a laser from her flying fortress to threaten Megakat City.
 Lieutenant (voiced by Jennifer Hale) - An unnamed lieutenant who serves as Turmoil's second-in-command.
 Omega Squadron - Turmoil's all-female fighter squadron. Besides the pilots who fly Turmoil's high-tech jets, there are also her Security Guards and her Special Forces who guard the Sky-Lion.
 The Evil SWAT Kats (voiced by Barry Gordon and Charlie Adler) – Villainous variations of the SWAT Kats from a parallel dimension accessed by the real SWAT Kats by accident during a thunderstorm. They serve the alternate dimension's Dark Kat and plot with the alternate Callie Briggs to overthrow Megakat City's government. They exhibit alternate characteristics to the real SWAT Kats such as Razor being a bossy shot, T-Bone being a clumsy and a lousy pilot, and the two of them hating each other. They were presumably killed when a Mega-Detonator they were carrying imploded. This did not please Dark Kat or the alternate Callie Briggs who was secretly on Dark Kat's side. They appeared only in ""The Dark Side of the SWAT Kats"". The Dark SWAT Kats are the only characters shown in the alternate dimension who don't look like their counterparts, but only the viewers seemed to be able to tell the difference.
 Giant Scorpions - When Tiger Conklin of a mining company was illegally dumping toxic waste into a mining cavern, harmless cave scorpions were mutated into humanoid mutants later dubbed Mega-Scorpions with a hive mind, bringing food to the queen Mega-Scorpion. The Mega-Scorpions began preying on the miners which they fed to their leader. Mining foreman Taylor called in the Enforcers to help. However, Ann Gora managed to sneak in to the cavern and the intrepid reporter was captured by one of the Mega-Scorpions. Lt. Feral and the SWAT Kats went in to find Ann Gora but the SWAT Kats new Turbo Mole went 8 miles below the surface, resulting in them finding the scorpions. Feral and the Swat Kats defeated hordes of the Mega-Scorpions and found Ann, but were forced to flee from the scorpion leader. The leader apparently fell into a pit of lava, but survived and attacked the SWAT Kats again. The scorpion leader grabbed the Turbo Kat but was finally destroyed when the Swat Kats flew into Earth's atmosphere which caused the leader to explode.
 Zed (voiced by Charlie Adler) - A Micro-Brain Repair Unit created by Dr. Leiter Greenbox, the robot later to be known as Zed was designed to analyze mechanical objects and reassemble them. However, after he was stolen by the Metallikats so they could repair themselves, Zed's programming was 'contaminated' by their criminal personalities, causing its artificial intelligence to evolve. As Zed evolved, it built a robot body out of metal parts it scrounged from machines all over the city (including the Metallikats), building his body bigger and bigger as he went along. Zed eventually headed towards Puma-Dyne in order to absorb a weapons satellite they had built called the Mega-Beam, intending to destroy the city with it. Zed even managed to merge its mind with that of its creator, and was about to fire the Mega-Beam when T-Bone used a torn piece of cable to whip Zed's brain, destroying it.

Other characters
 Dr. Leiter Greenbox (voiced by Robert Patrick in ""Chaos in Crystal,"" Nick Chinlund in ""Unlikely Alloys"") - A scientist whose inventions always seem to go wrong. In his first appearance, he was hired by Warden Cyrus Meece of Megakat Maximum Security Prison to a gem-mining gadget called the Gemkat 6000, designed to separate rare and precious stones from rock without digging. But when Rex Shard, the prisoner testing the device, tried to steal some gems from the device, an explosion erupted which turned his body into crystal. Dr. Greenbox attempted to rewire his prototype in order to reverse the effect, but he was turned into crystals by Shard, and remained so until the SWAT Kats managed to cure Shard themselves. Later, while working at Megakat University, Dr. Greenbox created an artificially-intelligent device called a Micro-Brain Repair Unit, which, after having its programming contaminated by the Metallikats, evolved into a self-aware mechanical entity called Zed, building a robot body around itself using any metal objects it could get its hands on. Though Dr. Greenbox originally attempted to help the SWAT Kats destroy Zed, once inside his head, he was so overwhelmed at how much his creation had evolved that he turned against them and merged with his machine; after Zed's brain was destroyed, Greenbox collapsed and was turned over to the Enforcers, after which his fate is uncertain.
 David Litterbin (voiced by John Byner) - An obvious parody of David Letterman, Litterbin was the undisputed ""King of Late Night"" and host of The David Litterbin Show. Razor was his biggest fan and he was seen on television numerous times. He actually appeared in ""Enter the Madkat"", where he was believed to have descended from the jester responsible for making Madkat insane, as years later, he won the title for ""King of Late Night"", making Lenny Ringtail insane.
 Burke and Murray (voiced by Mark Hamill and Charlie Adler) - Two brothers employed to dump junk in the salvage yard that Jake and Chance work in. Burke is the tall one and Murray is the short one. Their mocking attitudes constantly irritated Jake and Chance, but they were absent from the second season.
 Little Old Lady (voiced by Candi Milo) - A cranky old lady whose car always seemed to be breaking down. She consistently threatened to report Jake and Chance to her auto club, but never actually did. On one occasion, she received a free pizza and three free tune-ups as an apology from Jake and Chance for when their vigilantism took priority over a towing job.
 Dr. N. Zyme (voiced by Paul Eiding) - A slightly absentminded biochemist who worked for Megakat Biochemical Labs. His intentions were to create anti-mutagens that would preserve and benefit katkind, but his biggest hope, Viper Mutagen 368, proved to be worthless after Dr. Elrod Purvis, having died from attempting to rob Zyme of the formula, was revived as Dr. Viper. Zyme presumably died in ""The Giant Bacteria"", when he tried to combat Viper's bacteria monsters with antibiotics.
 Captain Grimalken (voiced by Michael Bell) - Leader of the Aqueons, a race of blue-furred alien kats who are naturally nonviolent and peaceful; they would rather be taken prisoner than fight back. Grimalken was captain of the water freighter that Mutilor stole for his space-pirating purposes. Initially he told the SWAT Kats he would not help them fight, but at a crucial moment, and unseen by anyone else, he did kick a henchman in the face as the henchman was going for a blaster. In gratitude for the SWAT Kats (Razor and T-Bone) and Lt. Feral's actions, he used some of his ""high speed space technology"" to repair the Turbokat, which Mutilor had damaged during a battle.

"Bilson Halt railway station

Bilson Halt railway station is a disused railway station opened on the former Bullo Pill Railway, later known as the Great Western Railway Forest of Dean Branch.

History

The Halt, which was just to the south of Letchers Bridge and Bilson Junction/Yard was located about 4 miles 61 chains from Newnham on a 1 in 1280 gradient.

The station opened for passenger services when they were introduced in August 1907, the low platform was constructed from wood and two pagoda style buildings were provided from the outset.

The Halt temporarily served Cinderford until the Bilson loop was opened which allowed trains to run into the Severn and Wye station that was closer to the town.

The halt remained in unadvertised use until 1944, when it was finally removed.

"John O'Dowd (Sligo MP)

John O'Dowd (13 February 1856 – 26 October 1937) was Irish Nationalist Member of Parliament for North Sligo, March–September 1900, and for South Sligo, 1900-18.

Life
He was born in Tubbercurry, Co. Sligo but emigrated to the US at an early age, returning in the later 1870s to Bunninadden, Sligo, where he was a farmer and lived for the rest of his life.  He was connected with Irish political movements from 1880 onwards and in 1881-82 was imprisoned as a ‘suspect’ under the then coercion legislation.

He was a veteran of the Land League and active in the United Irish League.  He was associated with the Irish Republican Brotherhood after his return from the US.  For many years he was chairman of Sligo County Council and his son later became accountant to the Council.

He was elected unopposed to represent North Sligo on 7 March 1900 following the resignation of Bernard Collery, and transferred unopposed to his native South Sligo constituency at the general election later that year.  He held this seat unopposed through successive general elections until December 1918, when he was defeated by the Sinn Féin candidate Alexander McCabe by 9,113 votes to 1,988.  O’Dowd had made representations on McCabe's behalf when the latter had been tried, and acquitted, for possession of explosives.
Maume (1999) states that O’Dowd was accused of corruption and of organising violence against Sinn Féin supporters during the North Leitrim by-election of 1908, and that he was himself beaten up and severely injured by Sinn Féin supporters on polling day in 1918.

As a local authority representative, O’Dowd was a member of the Irish Convention of 1917-18, which unsuccessfully attempted to reconcile North and South Ireland.

He published a volume of poems, Lays of South Sligo, and contributed poems to T. D. Sullivan’s Weekly News.

"Johnny Rodriguez

Juan Raul Davis ""Johnny"" Rodriguez (born December 10, 1951) is an American country music singer. He is a Latin American country music singer, infusing his music with Latin sounds, and even singing verses of songs in Spanish.

In the 1970s and 1980s, he was one of country music's most successful male artists, recording a string of hit songs, such as ""You Always Come Back to Hurting Me,"" ""Desperado,"" ""Down on the Rio Grande"" and ""Foolin'."" He has recorded six No. 1 country hits in his career.

Early life and rise to fame
Rodriguez was born in Sabinal, Texas, a small town situated 90 miles from Mexico. He was the second youngest in a family of 10 children living in a four-room house.

Growing up in Sabinal, Rodriguez was a good student in school and an altar boy for his church. He was also the captain of his junior high school football team. When Rodriguez was 16 years old, his father died of cancer, and his older brother, Andres, died in an automobile accident the following year. The two incidents had an effect on Rodriguez and he became a troubled teen. In 1969, at age 18, Rodriguez ended up in jail. He sang frequently in his cell and was overheard by Texas Ranger Joaquin Jackson, who was very impressed and told promoter ""Happy"" Shahan about him. (The common story told is that he was arrested after he and some friends were caught stealing and barbecuing a goat, although Jackson would later state that Rodriguez was in jail simply for an unpaid fine.)

Shahan then hired Johnny to perform at his local tourist attraction called the Alamo Village. During one of his sets in 1971, he came to the attention of country singers Tom T. Hall and Bobby Bare, who encouraged the young singer to go to Nashville, Tennessee.

The 21-year-old singer arrived in Nashville with only a guitar in his hand and $14 in his pocket. Hall soon found work for Rodriguez fronting his band, as well as writing songs.

Less than one year later, Hall personally took Rodriguez to the heads of Mercury Records' Nashville division to land him an audition with the record label. After performing the songs ""I Can't Stop Loving You"" and ""If I Left It Up to You,"" he was offered a contract with Mercury. He signed and began recording in their Nashville studio.

Career in the 1970s
After signing with Mercury, Rodriguez was soon on the way to becoming famous. His first single to be released for Mercury was 1972's ""Pass Me By."" This recording was a big success, going to No. 9 on the Hot Country Songs list that year, and making him a country star overnight. Rodriguez became the first well-known American of Mexican descent as a country singer. (Freddy Fender achieved fame a few years later, in 1975.)

In 1972 Rodriguez was voted the Most Promising Vocalist by the Academy of Country Music. The next year, he achieved his first No. 1 hit song, ""You Always Come Back to Hurting Me."" Another song that year, ""Ridin' My Thumb to Mexico,"" was also a  No. 1 hit. Both his No. 1 hits charted on the Pop charts, but only moderately. Rodriguez wrote some of his own material such as the song ""Ridin' My Thumb to Mexico."" In 1973, his debut album was released, which rose to No. 1 on the ""Top Country Albums"" chart. He was nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year by the CMA Awards. In addition to his success in country music, he also had a role on the television show Adam-12 and also made a guest appearance on The Dating Game in 1974. He also began to appear on talk shows.

The year 1975 was probably his biggest year, in terms of chart success. That year all three singles he released soared to No. 1 on the country charts: ""I Just Can't Get Her Out of My Mind"" ""Just Get Up and Close the Door,"" and ""Love Put a Song in My Heart.""

Rodriguez's success on the country charts continued throughout much of the 1970s. He recorded songs not only written by himself around this time, but also covers of songs such as George Harrison's ""Something,"" Linda Hargrove's ""Just Get Up and Close the Door,"" Mickey Newbury's ""Poison Red Berries,"" and Billy Joe Shaver's ""Texas Up Here Tennessee."" By 1975, Rodriguez was considered a member of the outlaw country market in country music, like fellow musicians Bobby Bare and Tom T. Hall.

Career in the 1980s and '90s and murder charge
Despite the outlaw movement fading from view in the late 1970s, Rodriguez was determined to stay on top of his game. In 1979, he switched to Epic Records. Under Epic, he worked with the legendary producer Billy Sherrill, who produced some of the biggest names in the business at the time. His first hit from Epic came that year with the No. 6 country hit, ""Down on the Rio Grande."" His debut album from the record company was entitled Rodriguez. All the songs from the album were cover versions.

Although Rodriguez did not make the Top 10 continuously as in the past, he managed to stay in the Top 20, with hits like ""Fools For Each Other"" and ""What'll I Tell Virginia."" At the same time, Rodriguez continued to be a popular concert attraction. However, Rodriguez was also having personal problems. In 1982, he did a duet with Zella Lehr on the song ""Most Beautiful Girl (La Chica Mas Linda)."" The single was released by Columbia Records. In 1983, he went into the Top 5 with the hit song ""Foolin',"" followed by the Top 10 hit ""How Could I Love Her So Much."" However, by the mid-80s, he was becoming less successful. In 1986, he left Epic Records.

In 1987, he signed with Capitol Records for a brief period of time. He had his last major hit in 1988 with ""I Didn't (Every Chance I Had),"" which reached No. 12 on the country charts. By 1989, he left Capitol Records.

In August 1998, Rodriguez shot and killed a 28-year-old acquaintance in his Texas home, believing the man to be a burglar. In October 1999, he was acquitted of murder by a jury.

Overall in the course of his career, Rodriguez released 26 albums and 45 charted singles. He has also had six No. 1 hits on the country charts.

In 1993, he recorded an album for Intersound Records called Run For the Border. In the mid-1990s, the indie label High-Tone released his album You Can Say That Again. He continued to tour around the country during this time. In 1996, he turned to another label, Paula Records, which issued a single called ""One Bar At a Time"", but it was unsuccessful. By this time his musical presence was fading from the public view, as more neo-traditional country singers were making hits on the country charts, like Garth Brooks, Randy Travis, and Dwight Yoakam.

Album CD reissues
Several labels have re-issued the music of Johnny Rodriguez. The UK-based Hux Records re-issued digitally remastered versions of his first two albums ""Introducing"" and ""All I Ever Meant To Do Was Sing."" Hux Records plans to release more of Johnny's classic material in the near future. The label is owned and operated by an English businessman named Brian O'Reilly, who is an outspoken fan of Johnny Rodriguez.

Life after 1998 to present
Since 1998, Rodriguez has toured the United States and world, performing in countries including Switzerland, Poland, England, South Korea, Canada, and Mexico. He has performed concerts at the famed Ryman Auditorium and Carnegie Hall.

Rodriguez continues to tour and record new material, performing dates in the United States and Canada, where his music remains popular. In 2012, he released the first official live concert album entitled Johnny Rodriguez: Live from Texas. The album includes most of his biggest hits in addition to fan favorites and new songs from recent releases.

Awards and recognition
Rodriguez has been honored by three U.S. presidents: Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush. He played at George H.W. Bush's inaugural ball.

On August 18, 2007, Rodriguez was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame, located in Carthage, Texas.

On October 23, 2010, Johnny Rodriguez received the Institute of Hispanic Culture Pioneer Award, in recognition of his accomplishment as the first major Hispanic singer in country music.

Personal life

Johnny Rodriguez was first married to Linda Diann Patterson, a Southern Airways flight attendant from Conyers, Georgia. Johnny Rodriguez then married a second time in 1995 to Lana Nelson daughter of country singer/songwriter Willie Nelson. His marriage to Lana lasted only 7 months (Smolowe, Jill People Magazine Nov. 1, 1999 Vol. 52 No. 17). Johnny's last marriage was to Debbie McNeely, a hair salon owner from San Marcos, Texas, in 1998 with whom he had a daughter, Aubry Rae Rodriguez born April 1998 (Smolowe, Jill People Magazine, Nov. 1, 1999 Vol. 52)

"Ordos culture

The Ordos culture was a culture occupying a region centered on the Ordos Loop (modern Inner Mongolia, China) during the Bronze and early Iron Age from the 6th to 2nd centuries BCE. The Ordos culture is known for significant finds of Scythian art and is thought to represent the easternmost extension of Indo-European Eurasian nomads,  such as the Saka. Under the Qin and Han dynasties, from the 6th to 2nd centuries BCE, the area came under at least nominal control of contemporaneous Chinese states.

Background
Equestrian nomads from the north-west occupied the area previously settled by the Zhukaigou culture from the 6th to the 2nd century BCE before being driven away by the Xiongnu. The Ordos Plateau was covered by grass, bushes, and trees and was sufficiently watered by numerous rivers and streams to produce rich grazing lands. At the time, it contained the best pasture lands on the Asian Steppe. However, it has now mostly turned to the Ordos Desert through a combination of overgrazing and climatic change.

Characteristics
The Ordos are mainly known from their skeletal remains and artifacts. The Ordos culture of about 500 BCE to 100 CE is known for its ""Ordos bronzes"", blade weapons, finials for tent-poles, horse gear, and small plaques and fittings for clothes and horse harness, using animal style decoration with relationships both with the Scythian art of regions much further west, and also Chinese art. Its relationship with the Xiongnu is controversial; for some scholars they are the same and for others different. Many buried metal artefacts have emerged on the surface of the land as a result of the progressive desertification of the region.

The Ordos are thought to be the easternmost of the Iranian peoples of the Eurasian Steppe, just to the east of the better-known Yuezhi, also an Indo-European people. Because the people represented in archaeological finds tend to display Europoid features, also earlier noted by Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen, Iaroslav Lebedynsky suggests the Ordos culture had ""a Scythian affinity"". Other scholars have associated it with the Yuezhi. The weapons found in tombs throughout the steppes of the Ordos are very close to those of the Scythians and Saka.

Contact with neighbouring peoples
While the ethnolinguistic origins and character of the Ordos culture are unknown, the population appears to have been significantly influenced by Indo-European cultures. However, the art of the Ordos culture appears to have influenced that of the Donghu people (), a Mongolic-speaking nomadic tribe located to the east, suggesting that the two had close ties. (The Donghu may also have been connected to a people known as the Northern Di in Chinese annals.

The Ordos population was also in contact – and reportedly often at war – with the pre-Han and Han peoples. The Ordos culture covered, geographically, regions later occupied by the Han, including areas just north of the later Great Wall of China and straddling the northernmost hook of the Yellow River.

To the west of the Ordos culture was another Indo-European people, the Yuezhi, although nothing is known of relations between the two. (The Yuezhi were later vanquished by the Xiongnu and Wusun, who reportedly drove them westward, out of China; a subgroup of the Yuezhi is widely believed to have migrated to South Central Asia, where it constituted the ruling elite of the Kushan Empire.)

Appearance of the Xiongnu

In Chinese accounts, the Xiongnu first appear at Ordos in the Yi Zhou Shu and Classic of Mountains and Seas during the Warring States period before it was occupied by the states of Qin and Zhao. It is generally thought to be their homeland; however, when exactly they came to occupy the region is unclear and archaeological finds suggest it might have been much earlier than traditionally thought.

As the Xiongnu expanded southward into Yuezhi territory around 160 BCE under Modun, the Yuezhi in turn defeated the Sakas and pushed them away at Issyk Kul. It is thought the Xiongnu also occupied the Ordos area during the same period, when they came in direct contact with the Chinese. From there, the Xiongnu conducted numerous devastating raids into Chinese territory (167, 158, 142, 129 BCE).

The Han–Xiongnu War began with Emperor Wu of Han, and the Han colonized the area of the Ordos as the commandery of Shuofang in 127 BCE. Prior to this campaign, there were already  earlier commanderies established by Qin and Zhao before they were overrun by the Xiongnu in 209 BCE.

"Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1971

The Delhi Sikh Gurdwaras Act of 1971 is a piece of Indian legislation modeled after the Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, which determines the management of Sikh houses of worship within Delhi Union Territory. The 1971 act, more stringent than the 1925 act, required that any Sikhs voting for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee be baptized Sikhs (amritdhari). The legislation thus excluded from voting those Sikhs with shorn hair, and the sahajdhari, persons who generally follow the Sikh lifestyle but are not initiated into the religion.

"Manila Bay

Manila Bay () is a natural harbor which serves the Port of Manila (on Luzon), in the Philippines. Strategically located around the capital city of the Philippines, Manila Bay facilitated commerce and trade between the Philippines and its neighboring countries, becoming the gateway for socio-economic development even prior to Spanish occupation. With an area of , and a coastline of , Manila Bay is situated in the western part of Luzon and is bounded by Cavite and Metro Manila on the east, Bulacan and Pampanga on the north, and Bataan on the west and northwest. Manila Bay drains approximately  of watershed area, with the Pampanga River contributing about 49% of the freshwater influx. With an average depth of , it is estimated to have a total volume of 28.9 billion cubic meters (28.9 cubic km). Entrance to the bay is  wide and expands to a width of . However, width of the bay varies from  at its mouth and expanding to  at its widest point.

The islands of Corregidor and Caballo divides the entrance into two channels, about  towards the North and  wide on the South side. Mariveles, in the province of Bataan, is an anchorage just inside the northern entrance and Sangley Point is the former location of Cavite Naval Base. On either side of the bay are volcanic peaks topped with tropical foliage: 40 km to the north is the Bataan Peninsula and to the south is the province of Cavite.

Across the entrance to Manila Bay are several islands, the largest of which is Corregidor, located 3 kilometers from Bataan and, along with the island of Caballo, separates the mouth of the bay into the North and South Channels. In the south channel is El Fraile Island and outside the entrance, and to the south, is Carabao Island. El Fraile, a rocky island some  in area, supports the massive concrete and steel ruins of Fort Drum, an island fortress constructed by the United States Army to defend the southern entrance of the bay. To the immediate north and south are additional harbors, upon which both local and international ports are situated. Large number of ships at the North and South harbors facilitate maritime activities in the bay. Being smaller of the two harbors, the North Harbor is used for inter-island shipping while the South Harbor is used for large ocean-going vessels.

History
Manila Bay was connected to Laguna de Bay (pronounced ""bai"") approximately 3,000 years ago. Recurring episodic
uplifts along the West Marikina Valley Fault caused the two to break up. Interaction between Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay today occurs only through the Pasig River.
The bay was the setting for the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898, in which American troops led by Commodore George Dewey seized the area. This battle showcased the United States' naval strength. All major Spanish ships were destroyed and captured.  With its proud historic past and abundant marine life, Manila Bay became the ocean portal and Filipino epicenter for government, economy and industry. During the Russo-Japanese War at the close of the Battle of Tsushima in 1905, three surviving Russian protected cruisers (the Aurora, Zhemchug, and Oleg) managed to make port in then-United States-controlled Manila for repairs. However, because the US was neutral in this conflict, the trio of warships and their crews remained interned by the U.S. until the war officially came to an end in September 1905. During the World War II, Corregidor Island was annexed by the Japanese forces based in Manila Bay. Much earlier, various other battles were fought from this naval base, including the Battles of La Naval de Manila in 1646, which finally ended Dutch attempts to seize the Philippines.

The bay remains important for commerce and industry, including fishing, although rapid urban growth and industrialization are contributing to a decline in water quality and deteriorating marine habitats.  It also serves a focus for recreation for Metro Manila and is a popular destination for walks and for viewing the sunset.  Much of the land fronting the bay along Metro Manila is reclaimed land which now includes important sites such as the Philippine Senate and the Mall of Asia.

On 27 September 2011, the sea walls of Manila Bay were destroyed by the storm surge caused by Typhoon Pedring. Even the United States Embassy, Museo Pambata and Sofitel Philippine Plaza were submerged by the flooding. It was estimated that the damage would cost P30 million to repair. On April 2012, the sea walls were once again opened to the public, having been redesigned to withstand a strong storm surge.

Ecosystem 
Coastal and marine habitats in the area include upland forests, mangrove, mudflats, sandy beaches, sea grass and coral reefs.

Biodiversity 

A total of 19,139 birds belonging to 330 families and 99 species were observed at various monitoring sites along the bay area. The endangered Chinese Egret (Egretta eulophotes) and Black-winged cuckoo-shrike were sighted in the area. A large number of migratory birds, catfish and mackerels were once abundant in these waters. Their decline ushered in the appearance of squid, shrimp, and small pelagic species such as herrings and anchovies.

Mangroves 

The mangrove ecosystem around Manila Bay has both ecological and socioeconomic uses with its association of unique plant and animal species.
Of the original 54,000 hectares of mangroves existing at the turn of the 20th century, only 794 hectares are remaining as recorded in 1995. A few of the mangrove swamps remaining in Pampanga Bay are of considerable value for research and conservation education. As natural habitats, mangroves considerably help in acting as a protective buffer against cyclones and storms.

Predominant in the bay area are Avicennia marina (gray or white mangrove)  together with 15 species of mangroves belonging to 9 families that grow there. In the Bataan area, species of mangrove swamps that are found thriving include:
Rhizophora apiculata (bakhaw lalaki in Filipino)
Rhyzophora mucronata (no common name found)
Avicennia marina (gray or white mangrove)
Nypa fruticans (nipa palm)
Sonneratia alba (no common name)
Scyphiphora hydrophyllacea (nilad in Filipino)
Sonneratia acida (pagatpat in Filipino)
Acanthus ilicifolius (holly-leaved acanthus)
Excoecaria agallocha (milky mangrove)

Plantations of Cocos nucifera (coconut palm) co-exists with the mangroves found in these areas.

Wetlands 
Covering about 4,600 hectares, wetlands around Manila Bay are useful in:
providing food and habitat for fish, shorebirds and wildlife;
maintaining and improving water quality of rivers, lakes and estuaries,
acting as reservoir for watersheds, and
protecting adjacent and downstream properties of the area from potential flood damage

Mudflats, sand flats, swamps, beaches and rocky shores form part of the wetlands in Manila Bay. Found mostly along the coast of Bataan and
Pampanga, mudflats are suitable habitats for shellfish.

Coral Reefs 
Contributing to the balanced functioning of the ecosystem around Manila Bay, coral reefs in the area provide sanctuary for fishes. Consequently, its decline through the years has directly affected the fish yield.

Seagrass Beds 
As a diverse ecosystem, seagrass beds provide shelter for fishes and other marine life forms. Like the coral reefs, most of the seagrass beds in Manila Bay are found near its mouth, most notably in the areas of Malolos, Orion, Mariveles, and Corregidor Island.

Upland forests
Within the watershed of Manila Bay upland forests abound which are sources of food, timber, fuel wood and other products, as well as habitats for wildlife. These forests provide protection from soil erosion and help maintain the water levels and water quality in rivers and streams. Mount Makiling, Angat Dam watershed, La Mesa Dam watershed, Mounts Palay-Palay / Mataas na Gulod Protected Landscape, Mount Arayat and other portions of national parks located in Bataan, Bulacan, Rizal and Tarlac form part of these upland forest ecosystem.

Key developments

Land reclamation
Largely intended for use in human settlement and industrial development, land reclamation projects contributed to the reduction of mangroves around the area, as well as significant reduction in Metro Manila's shoreline.  From 1944 to 1991, approximately 600 m of shoreline have been reclaimed in the northern part. In 2009, the Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) said that there are 7,000 hectares of foreshore areas in Cavite and 5,000 hectares of shallow coastal waters to expand Sangley Point naval base as part of reclamation projects which are mostly funded by foreign investors.

Land conversion
Conversion of mangrove and mudflat areas into fishponds have impacted the physical features of the bay whereby what used to be irregular shoreline in 1944 has become more linear by 1977. Shoreline retreat continued as man-made structures such as fish pens occupied the coastal areas, with progradation dominant from 1977 to 1991. Most area of the bay, except those near the ports, are largely used as a major fishing ground, with fisheries and aquaculture as the dominant source of livelihood for the inhabitants in the coastal areas.

From 1990, approximately 1,200 hectares of mangroves were cleared, with the land converted for aquaculture or used as salt beds. In 1993 much of the fisheries resources steadily declined due to over-fishing and over-harvesting.

Waterfront development

With then Mayor Lito Atienza's program Buhayin ang Maynila (Revitalize Manila) in 2002, the local government made the initiative of enhancing the seaside promenade of Manila through urban renewal, upkeep and improvements. What later became known as Baywalk, the facelift of the 2 km strip of central public space aimed at creating a venue for social interaction and recreation.

With reference to its colonial history, Manila's waterfront expresses power through the dominant classes  which uses the Baywalk for exercise, fishing or socialization. The mix of land utilization and social activity provides public access to the edge of the sea, and counters vagrancy and mendicancy.  Reviving Manila's waterfront through the Baywalk injected vibrance and historic appreciation into the public space with the statues of Arsenio Lacson, Ninoy Aquino and Evelio Javier placed in key areas.

At the onset, lack of funds hampered the revival of the Baywalk. Eventually, planning for the Baywalk means understanding and regulating diversity of functions with appropriate policy.

Legislation
Manila Bay and its corresponding resources are considered critical recipients of environmental protection. As indicated in the 1987 Constitution (Article II, Section 16) there exists legal basis for environmental protection with the provision that:
“the State shall protect and advance the right of the people to a balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature.”

The Manila Bay Declaration 2001 recognized Manila Bay as a source of food, employment and income for the people as well as the gateway for tourism and recreation.

Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants was adopted in 2001 and enforced in 2004.

Water quality
Successive changes in and around Manila Bay are largely due to the intertwining impacts of continued industrialization, unrelenting increase in population, and the incessant human activities catering to livelihood and habitation. These factors are directly degrading the overall environment of Manila Bay and these impacts are manifested in the continued deterioration of the water quality within the bay. Several industries  operate along the bay in the highly urbanized Metro Manila area, while there are shipyard facilities in Cavite and in Bataan, several more heavy industries, refineries and a power plant are present. At the shipping ports and ferry terminals, an average of 30,000 ships arrive and depart annually to transport passengers, manufactured goods and raw materials. Industrial waste discharges and discharges of untreated domestic wastes from drainage and sewer outlets have contributed to the severe decline in the quality of water and sediments in the bay as well as impacted on the existing marine habitats.

Salinity 
According to the study by Jacinto Manila bay has an average surface salinity of 32.6 psu (practical salinity unit). Due to the river influx, the areas near the coasts have low salinity especially in the vicinity of the mouth of the Pasig River in the eastern part of the bay. The bay’s salinity is also affected by strong seasonal variations.

Effects of soil erosion 
As indicated by the exposed roots of the coconut trees, continuing soil erosion has been a major factor in the changing shoreline of Manila bay. Apart from soil erosion, other environmental processes such as siltation and sea level rise have also contributed to changing the bay’s coastline. In some parts of the bay, however, erosion are prevented by seawalls and breakers particularly in areas where land has been reclaimed.

Pollution 

With the presence of ports, sea-based sources of pollution around the bay are from ships and motorized boats. Twelve oil spills were recorded in 1995, but it was in 1999 where the highest total volume of oil spill occurred in the Manila South Harbor and Limay, Bataan. Increased presence of oil and grease in the waters are attributed to maritime activities at the harbors, together with the presence of oil terminals and the discharges from industries. These factors directly impacted the health of Manila Bay's waters.

Aside from oil spills, trace metals such as copper, cadmium and zinc at the surface of the water were found at the bay coming from sea-based and land-based (e.g., domestic sewage, industrial effluents, runoff, combustion emissions, and mining operations) sources.

In 1996, concentrations of 16 commonly used pesticides in surface sediment was found including dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) found in Manila Bay sediments have been influenced by human activities. PAH come principally from petrogenic sources (e.g., oil discharges from ships, refineries and industries) and pyrolytic sources (from combustion sources).

Pesticide residues from rice paddy water draining into irrigation canals, which later on empty into river systems and eventually flowing into the surrounding lakes reaches the waters of Manila Bay. Compounds from these pesticide residues find themselves in food items with metamidophos, endosulfan, chlorpyrifos and diazinon among the common contaminants. While chronic toxic effects on inhabitants of the bay are not found, impairment of marine biota were more evident.

In 1997, polychlorinated biphenyl congeners (PCBs), compounds common in transformers, hydraulic fluids, paint additives and pesticides were determined in sediments and oysters sampled from Manila Bay. The increase in the nutrient concentration and presence of nitrate, ammonia and phosphate in the bay,from the '80s, through to the '90s and beyond are not only attributed to agricultural runoff and river discharges but also on fertilizers from fishponds.

Future

Rehabilitation 

Despite the issues generally associated with developing countries, such as poverty, over-population and food security, there is surprisingly a growing concern for the environmental vitality of Manila Bay.  Rehabilitation, which in this case refers to an attempt to improve an aquatic system and prevent further damage to the natural ecosystems, is a responsibility assumed both by government and non-government organizations.  The Supreme Court of the Philippines for example had issued the Metro Manila Development Authority an order to ""demolish illegal structures and dwellings along riverbanks and waterways connected to Manila Bay by 2015"" in March, 2011 as an attempt to decrease mass occurrences of water pollution.  Projects involving the wider communities include organization of the ""Manila Bay Clean Up Run,"" which essentially supports the Philippine Environment Agencies with their objectives to raise funding and awareness towards the rehabilitation of Manila Bay’s natural environments. 

In 2019, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources has launched a rehabilitation program that will be administered by different government agencies.  Due to this, the 10th Philippine International Pyromusical Competition that will happen on February 16, 2019 at the SM Mall of Asia bayside area was postponed, however, the venue was moved at SM City Clark on February 23, 2019.

Sea level rise
Global warming, which in its simplest context refers to an increase in the earth’s atmospheric temperature and the subsequent result of sea level rise, poses a great threat in the conservation of Manila Bay and its bordering cities.  With recent studies predicting ""the sea level could rise between .75 to 1.9 metres by 2100"" and considering the vast landscape of development, growing industries and overly-dense populations, the exponential assets exposed to flood-prone zones evidently become a dire
issue.  The Philippine Country Study to Address Climate Change has depicted a proactive approach to this environmental issue through
governance of a detailed impact assessment covering the following elements:

Physical Environment
 Tidal regimes including low and high levels of water circulation
 Outlining of seasons to depict periods of high and low rainfall

Habitat and Species
 Identification of coral species, mangrove forests, ecosystems within the coastlines, as well as nearby agricultural land

Vulnerability Analysis
 Vulnerability maps were drawn to outline townscape in accelerated sea level timelines.  Using such resources pinpoints the populated areas and natural habitats most likely to be inundated as a result of global warming

In 2010, at the occasion of the first Inter-LGU Forum on Tidal Flooding in Manila, the Dutch ambassador Robert Brinks recommended to close Manila Bay and build dykes in order to protect Manila and the surrounding provinces from the sea level rise that is expected as a result of climate change, noting also that closing Manily Bay in by means of a dyke would require new harbor location to replace the Port of Manila.

Challenges
Due to the low profile of environmentalism and its objectives within the nation of the Philippines, official awareness of global warming and the investment to applicable research is in itself triumphant.  Further steps to meet the challenge of rehabilitation and sea-level rise within Manila Bay may include additional research to gain insight to the complex nature of existent ecosystems; investment to coastal protection means such as the implementation of concrete walls; laws and policies dedicated to the protection of habitats and restriction or zoning of developments; as well as public educational programs to increase the intensity of conservation support.  Long-term goals for Manila Bay would ideally include the decrease or termination of nearby highly polluting enterprises, implementation effective standards for waste-water discharge and an overall improved water quality.

"Kavan Tissa, Prince of Ruhuna

Kavan Tissa, also known as Kavantissa, Kaha Wan Thissa,(that means who has the color of golden body). was the king of the Kingdom of Ruhuna in the southern part of Sri Lanka. He ruled Ruhuna, in the same time as Keleni Tissa of Maya Rata and the usurping Tamil king of Anuradhapura, Ellalan of South India, expanding and beautifying the city, and projecting the power of his native Rajarata region across the island of Sri Lanka. Kavan Tissa was a great-grandson of King Devanampiyatissa's youngest brother Mahanaga, and also the father of the great Sinhalese King Dutugemunu.

As with his son Dutugemunu, Kavan Tissa's figure is mostly swathed in myth and legend. The main source of information on his life is Mahavamsa, the historical poem about the kings of Sri Lanka, which portrays Kavan Tissa as ""devoutly believing in the three gems, [and] he provided the brotherhood continually with... needful things"".

"RusLine

RusLine (, Aviakompanija «RusLajn») is a regional airline from Russia, which operates mostly domestic regional flights, as well as holiday charters. Its headquarters are located in the Omega Plaza (Омега Плаза) business centre in Moscow, Russia, with the city's Domodedovo International Airport serving as most important base for flight operations.

History

The company was founded in 1999 as Aerotex Airlines and was originally based at Sheremetyevo International Airport. In March 2013, it was renamed to today's RusLine, which coincided with a move to Vnukovo International Airport shortly after.

On 1 April 2010, RusLine acquired the assets and brand name of bankrupt Air Volga. This included six Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft, and Air Volga's base at Volgograd International Airport. Subsequently, the Vnukovo operations were closed and moved to more modern Domodedovo International Airport, and the Air Volga livery was applied to a number of RusLine's aircraft. In certain cases, the Air Volga titles were also kept. Further aircraft bases were set up at Pulkovo Airport, Saint Petersburg and Koltsovo Airport, Yekaterinburg.

Route network

, RusLine operates scheduled flights to the following destinations.

Fleet
Originally, the airline operated several ageing Soviet-built aircraft. The first Western airliner, a 50-seat Bombardier CRJ100, was introduced with RusLine in February 2008. Over the following years, further planes of that type (all of which had been acquired second-hand) were added. In April 2012, RusLine took delivery of two larger Airbus A319 aircraft formerly owned by easyJet in order to address the growing demand for charter flights. The airline contains 20 CRJ-200 aircraft with 5 on order from UTAir with delivery from 2016.

Current fleet
, the RusLine fleet consists of the following aircraft:

Historic fleet
Over the years, the following aircraft types were operated:

Accidents and incidents

On 20 June 2011, 47 people died in the crash of Flight 243. The aircraft involved, a Tupolev Tu-134 (registered RA-65691) had been leased by RusLine from RusAir and was approaching Petrozavodsk Airport, completing a flight from Moscow-Domodedovo. Due to poor visibility conditions, the pilots were unaware that they descended too rapidly, so that the aircraft struck trees and impacted on a highway. There were five survivors.

"Constructive alignment

Constructive alignment is a principle used for devising teaching and learning activities, and assessment tasks, that directly address the intended learning outcomes (ILOs) in a way not typically achieved in traditional lectures, tutorial classes and examinations. Constructive alignment was devised by Professor John B. Biggs, and represents a marriage between a constructivist understanding of the nature of learning, and an aligned design for outcomes-based teaching education.  

Constructive alignment is the underpinning concept behind the current requirements for programme specification, declarations of learning outcomes (LOs) and assessment criteria, and the use of criterion based assessment. There are two basic concepts behind constructive alignment:

Learners construct meaning from what they do to learn. This concept derives from cognitive psychology and constructivist theory, and recognizes the importance of linking new material to concepts and experiences in the learner's memory, and extrapolation to possible future scenarios via the abstraction of basic principles through reflection.
The teacher makes a deliberate alignment between the planned learning activities and the learning outcomes. This is a conscious effort to provide the learner with a clearly specified goal, a well designed learning activity or activities that are appropriate for the task, and well designed assessment criteria for giving feedback to the learner.

A branch of educational evaluation theory has emerged that focuses on constructive alignment as a key element in effective  educational design. Known as design-focused evaluation, this approach seeks student feedback on the efficacy of the designed alignment between the intended learning outcomes and the teaching and learning activities students engage in during a course of study.

"Aerial warfare in the Winter War

The aerial warfare in the Winter War was the aerial aspect of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union from 30 November 1939 to 13 March 1940.  While the Soviet air forces greatly outnumbered the Finnish Air Force, the Soviet bombing campaign was largely ineffective, and Finnish pilots and antiaircraft gunners inflicted significant losses on the Soviets.

Soviet Air Force 

The Soviet Union enjoyed air superiority throughout the war. The Soviet Air Force, supported the Red Army's invasion with about 2,500 aircraft of the Soviet Air Forces, (the most common of which was the Tupolev SB-2 bomber, which had shown its effectiveness during the Spanish Civil war. However the VVS was not as effective as the Soviets might have hoped. The material damage by bomber attacks was slight, as Finland did not offer many valuable targets for strategic bombing. Targets were often small village depots of small value. Finland had only a few modern highways, so the railway systems were the main target for bombers. The rail tracks were cut thousands of times but were easily repaired, and the Finns usually had trains running in a matter of hours. The damage inflicted on Finnish targets was also diminished by poor navigation technique, and minimal bombing accuracy on the part of the Soviets and Finnish casualties were reduced by effective air-raid precautions. However the Soviet air force learned from its early mistakes, and by late February they instituted more effective tactics. One such success was the strike against the Ruokolahti airfield on 29 February 1940. At noon on that day 40 I-16 and I-153 fighters struck the base, destroying three aircraft on the ground and another three (two Gladiators and one Fokker) for the loss of only one I-16.

Finland's capital city, Helsinki, was bombed on the first day of the war; a number of buildings were destroyed and some 200 people were killed. However the city was the target of raids only a few times thereafter. All in all, Finland lost only 5 percent of its total man-hour production time due to Soviet bombings. Nevertheless, bombings affected thousands of civilians as the Soviets launched 2,075 bombing attacks on 516 localities. Air raids killed 957 Finnish civilians. The city of Viipuri, a major Soviet objective, was almost leveled by nearly 12,000 bombs. No attacks on civilian targets were mentioned in Soviet radio or newspaper reports. In January 1940, Pravda continued to stress that no civilian targets in Finland had been struck, even by accident.

Soviet aircraft
At the start of hostilities the Soviet Air Force had the following aircraft in service:

Fighters
 I-15: biplane fighter (Chaika-""seagull"")
 I-15 bis : (improved version of I-15)
 I-16  monoplane fighter (Ishak-""donkey""; called Siipiorava, ""flying squirrel"" by the Finns)
 I-16 bis
 I-153 biplane fighter (also called the Chaika; a variant of the I-15)

Bombers
 DB-3 twin engined long-range bomber
 SB-2  twin engined high-speed bomber (Katyusha- ""Catherine"")
 SB-2 bis
 TB-3  four-engined heavy bomber

Reconnaissance
 Po-2 multi-purpose biplane (kukuruznik-""crop-duster"")

Naval aviation
 MBR-2 multi-purpose flying boat
 MBR2 bis

Figures of Soviet losses during the conflict vary from source to source; One estimate puts the loss at 700-900 aircraft, the majority of them bombers: Against this Finnish losses were 62 aircraft, with a further 59 damaged beyond repair. Another states Finnish aircraft shot down 240 Soviet aircraft, with anti-aircraft fire accounting for 314 to 444 others.

Finnish Air Force

At the beginning of the war, Finland had a very small air force, with only 114 combat airplanes fit for duty. Therefore, Finnish air missions were very limited and fighter aircraft were mainly used to repel Soviet bombers. Old-fashioned and few in numbers, Finnish aircraft could not offer support to the Finnish ground troops. Therefore, the Finnish Air Force adopted the same guerilla tactics used by Finnish ground forces, dispersing to makeshift airfields often consisting only of a frozen lake. In spite of aircraft losses throughout the war, the Finnish Air Force grew by 50 percent by the end of the war. Most new aircraft shipments arrived during January 1940.

The Finnish Air Force had also revised its tactics; In air combat, the Finns used the more flexible  ""finger four"" formation (four planes split into two pairs, one flying low and the other high, with each plane fighting independently of the others, yet supporting its wingman in combat), which was superior to the Soviet tactic of three fighters flying in a Vic formation. This formation and the credo of Finnish pilots to always attack, no matter the odds, contributed to the failure of Soviet bombers to inflict substantial damage against Finnish positions and population centres.

Finnish fighter pilots often dove into Soviet formations that outnumbered them ten or even twenty times, and Soviet bomber formations became wary of even single Finnish fighters, as they knew the pilot would not let them pass un-noticed. Entire squadrons could disappear on missions over Finland, and those back at their bases in Estonia could only guess at what had happened.
On one occasion, the Finnish ace Jorma Kalevi Sarvanto encountered a formation of seven DB-3 bombers on 6 January 1940 and shot down six in just 4 minutes.

Finnish aircraft 
At the start of hostilities, the Finnish Air Force had 146 aircraft of all types at its disposal, organized into 12 squadrons. The primary fighter aircraft were 
 15 Bristol Bulldog IVs, which had entered service in 1935, 
 41 of the more modern Fokker D.XXI 
 65 older Fokker aircraft of various types; Fokker C.X and Fokker C.V
 15 Blackburn Ripons
There were also 18 license-built Bristol Blenheim bombers. In 1939, an order had been placed in Italy for 25 Fiat G.50 fighters; two were being assembled in Sweden when the war broke out.

During the war, a number of aircraft were ordered from abroad:
 30 Gloster Gladiator II biplane fighters from the United Kingdom
 12 Bristol Blenheim IV bombers from the United Kingdom
 30 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters from France
 44 Brewster 239 fighters from the United States
 24 Gloster Gauntlet trainers from South Africa
 10 Fiat G.50 fighters from Italy
 12 Hawker Hurricane I fighters from the United Kingdom
 12 Westland Lysander reconnaissance planes from United Kingdom
 2 Bristol Bulldogs from Sweden
 3 J6B Jaktfalken biplane trainers from Sweden
 3 Fokker C.V.D reconnaissance planes from Sweden
 2 Koolhoven F.K.52 reconnaissance planes and 1 Douglas DC-2 transport plane from Count von Rosen, Sweden
 6 Caudron C.714 fighters from France, which never entered service in Finnish Fighter Squadrons because of their bad performance and unsuitability to operate from the short landing strips in Finland.

Also there was a Swedish volunteer squadron named Flight Regiment 19, Finnish Air Force  taking care of the air defence of Northern Finland. It was equipped with 12 Gloster Gladiator II biplane fighters and 5 Hawker Hart biplane bombers.

Owing to this reinforcement, the Finnish Air Force had a greater strength at the end of the conflict than at the beginning; however they were seldom able to field more than 100 aircraft at any one time against an expanding VVS commitment.

Finnish fighters shot down 240 confirmed Soviet aircraft, against the Finnish loss of 26. A Finnish forward air base often consisted of only a frozen lake, a windsock, a telephone set and some tents. Air-raid warnings were given by Finnish women organized by the Lotta Svärd. Finnish antiaircraft gunners shot down between 314 and 444 Soviet aircraft.

"Johan Maurits Mohr

Johan Maurits Mohr (ca. 18 August 1716, Eppingen – 25 October 1775, Batavia) was a Dutch-German pastor who studied at Groningen University from 1733 and settled in Batavia (Dutch East Indies) in 1737. Mohr's greatest passion was in astronomy but he was also keenly interested in meteorology and in vulcanology.

In 1765 Mohr built a large private observatory in Batavia that was equipped with the best astronomical instruments of his time. His observatory, which had cost him a small fortune, was visited and praised by Louis Antoine de Bougainville and James Cook.

Mohr observed the Venus transits of 6 June 1761 and 3 June 1769 and the Mercury transit of 10 November 1769. He also made meteorological observations and measurements of the magnetic declination at Batavia.

After Mohr's death, his observatory was damaged by an earthquake in 1780, fell into ruin and was demolished in 1812.

The minor planet 5494 Johanmohr is named in his honour.

"Symphoniae sacrae I

(literally: Sacred Symphonies, Book One), Op. 6, is a collection of different pieces of vocal sacred music on Latin texts, composed by Heinrich Schütz, published in 1629. He set mostly psalms and excerpts from the Song of Solomon for one to three voices, with various instruments and continuo. Its twenty pieces were assigned 257 to 276 in the  (SWV), the catalogue of his works. Two later volumes came, but with German texts: Symphoniae sacrae II in 1647 and Symphoniae sacrae III in 1650.

History 
Schütz composed the first collection during his second study trip to Venice. During his first visit he studied the Venetian polychoral style with Giovanni Gabrieli. Returning in 1628 after Gabrieli's death, he studied with his successor at St Mark's Basilica, Claudio Monteverdi. Schütz was in the service of the Protestant Elector of Saxony Johann Georg I, and dedicated the collection to the Elector's son, crown prince Johann Georg II, then 16 years old. The texts are mostly taken from the Bible, most of them setting excerpts from psalms and from the Song of Solomon. Schütz set the texts as concertos for various combinations of one to three voices, instruments (both strings and winds) and basso continuo.

Schütz published the collection in 1629 in Venice as his , his sixth work, and his second sacred work. In his Latin foreword, he mentions Gabrieli, but not Monteverdi. The composer has been described as ""universal"" (), and after his  published a second work in Latin. The musicologist Matteo Messori notes: 

Schütz later composed two more collections titled  as Op. 10 and Op. 12. The general title was common at the time and was used by many composers, including his teacher including Giovanni Gabrieli who used it for his larger concertos.

Collection 
The collection contains twenty different individual concertos with numbers 257 to 276 in the SWV. The following table shows a sequence number, the SWV number, the first line of the Latin text replacing a title, a translation, an abbreviation of the text source and notes. The translations follow Emmanuel Music for SWV 257, 263, 264, a study bible for the Song of Solomon, otherwise  the King James version. Links to that bible version are provided in the next column. Note that psalm numbering and verse numbering within a psalm is different in different editions. The last column provides a link to the details about the piece from the Schütz Association, which contains the text, a translation to German, the volume in the Neue Schütz-Ausgabe, biblical source(s), and further links to the collection's history, original foreword, analysis, dedication, original cover, reception and sources.

Music 
Schütz followed Monteverdi's seconda pratica in setting the biblical texts not in the older polyphonic style, but in dramatic declamation close to the opera of the period. This approach to word setting mirrors the ideas of the Reformation in its focus on the words of scripture. The settings have been described as ""eloquent, sensitive, and often sensuous"".

Recordings 

The Symphoniae sacrae are part of the complete edition of the composer's works by Carus-Verlag, begun in 1992 in continuation of the Stuttgart Schütz Edition. The edition uses the  of the . They were recorded in 2003 with the Cappella Augustana including singers  Anna Mikołajczyk, Marzena Lubaszka, Piotr Lykowski, Krzysztof Szmyt, Robert Pozarski, Harry van der Kamp, Bogdan Makal, Walter Testolin and Gian Paolo Dal Dosso, conducted by organist Matteo Messori. They were recorded in 2016, as part of the complete recordings of works by Schütz, by the Dresdner Kammerchor and organist Ludger Rémy, conducted by Hans-Christoph Rademann, with soloists Dorothee Mields, Isabel Jantschek, David Erler, Georg Poplutz, Tobias Mäthger and Felix Schwandte.

"Bluestripe butterflyfish

The bluestripe butterflyfish or blue-striped butterflyfish (Chaetodon fremblii) is a species of butterflyfish (family Chaetodontidae) found in the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands. The fish is endemic to Hawaii where it is common on shallow water reefs.

Description
Butterfly fishes are laterally flattened fish up to  long with pointed snouts and rectangular bodies. The dorsal fin has 12 to 14 spines and 20 to 21 soft rays, while the anal fin has 3 spines and 16 to 18 soft rays. The bluestripe butterflyfish has eight distinctive diagonal blue stripes radiating from the eye region, on a yellow background. There is a black spot at the top of the head and another larger spot of black at the base of the tail. This latter dark patch may serve to distract predators by encouraging them to attack the tail rather than the head end.

Distribution
The bluestripe butterflyfish is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands where it is described as being abundant on coral and rocky reefs down to depths of about .

Ecology
Some butterflyfish are corallivores, feeding almost exclusively on corals. These usually have mating systems involving a pair bond, but the bluestripe butterflyfish is an omnivore, which means it lives in a more resource-rich environment, where it is easier to find sufficient food. As a result, males of this species operate a harem system, defending a territory which includes up to four smaller female territories.

Having a generalised diet, the bluestripe butterflyfish is sometimes kept in reef aquaria where it is easier to maintain than corallivorous types. Specimens are harvested from the wild and it is sometimes difficult to get the fish to eat in captivity. In this respect, juveniles within two or three months of settling are more willing to accept prepared and novel foods. Attempts have been made to breed the fish in captivity, but the lengthy larval period of about two months in the open ocean is difficult to replicate in captivity.

"Corporate Town of Jamestown

The Corporate Town of Jamestown was a local government area in South Australia, centred on the town of Jamestown. It was proclaimed on 25 July 1878, severing the seven-year old settlement of Jamestown from the surrounding District Council of Belalie. The first mayor was John Cockburn, later Premier of South Australia, with George Hingston Lake as town clerk. Under the new council, it instituted a tree-planting program from 1879, reportedly the first town in rural South Australia to do so.

In 1881, it was reported to have a population of 995; while this remained static for some decades, by 1936, it was reported to have a population of over 1,500, with 361 dwellings and 106 businesses, with the surrounding area described as ""one of the best agricultural districts in this state"". In the 1950s, the council offices were based out of the former Jamestown Institute, by then converted to a memorial hall. In 1979, the council launched a program of kerbing and sealing Jamestown streets. On 1 January 1991, it merged into the surrounding District Council of Jamestown; the merged council would itself amalgamate with surrounding municipalities to form the Northern Areas Council in 1997.

"Timeline of zoology

A timeline of the history of zoology.

Ancient world 
28000 BC. Cave painting (e.g. Chauvet Cave) in but, especially Spain, depict animals in a stylized fashion. Mammoths (the same species later to be seen thawing from ice in Siberia) were depicted in these European cave paintings.
10000 BC. Man (Homo sapiens) domesticated dogs, pigs, sheep, goats, fowl, and other animals in Europe, northern Africa and the Near East.
6500 BC. The aurochs, ancestor of domestic cattle, would be domesticated in the next two centuries if not earlier (Obre I, Yugoslavia). This fierce beast was the last major food animal to be tamed for use as a source of milk, meat, power, and leather in the Old World.

3500 BC. Sumerian animal-drawn wheeled vehicles and plows are developed in Mesopotamia, the region called the ""Fertile Crescent"" by U.S. archaeologist James Henry Breasted (1865–1935). Irrigation may also have used animal power. By increasing the area under cultivation and reducing the number of people required to raise food, society will permit a few people to become priests, artisans, scholars, and merchants. Since Sumeria had no natural defenses, armies with mounted cavalry and chariots became imperative and were a scourge upon the land they purported to protect. Civilization was thus built on the backs of equines (horses and asses).
2000 BC. Domestication of the silkworm in China.
1100 BC. Won Chang (China), first of the Chou emperors, stocked his imperial zoological garden with deer, goats, birds and fish from many parts of the world. Like zoos today, the animals may have been seen as exotic, alien, and possibly threatening. The emperor also enjoyed sporting events with the use of animals.
850 BC. Homer (Greek), reputedly a blind poet, wrote the epics Iliad and Odyssey. Both contain animals as monsters and metaphors (gross soldiers turned into pigs by the witch Circe), but also some correct observations on bees and fly maggots. Both epics make reference to mules. The ancient Greeks considered horses so highly that they ""hybridized"" them with humans, to form boisterous centaurs. At any rate, animals are used as metaphors and moral symbols by Homer to make a timeless story.
610 BC. Anaximander (Greek, 610 BC–545 BC) was a student of Thales of Miletus. The first life, he taught, was formed by spontaneous generation in the mud. Later animals came into being by transmutations, left the water, and reached dry land. Man was derived from lower animals, probably aquatic. His writings, especially his poem On Nature, were read and cited by Aristotle and other later philosophers, but are lost.
563? BC. Buddha (Indian, 563?–483 BC) had gentle ideas on the treatment of animals. Animals are held to have intrinsic worth, not just the values they derive from their usefulness to man.
500 BC. Empedocles of Agrigentum (Greek, 504–433 BC) reportedly rid a town of malaria by draining nearby swamps. He proposed the theory of the four humors and a natural origin of living things.

500 BC. Alcmaeon (Greek, c. 500 BC) performed human dissections. He identified the optic nerve, distinguished between veins and arteries, and showed that the nose was not connected to the brain. He made much of the tongue and explained how it functioned. He also gave an explanation for semen and for sleep.
500 BC. Xenophanes (Greek, 576–460 BC), a disciple of Pythagoras (?–497 BC), first recognized fossils as animal remains and inferred that their presence on mountains indicated the latter had once been beneath the sea. ""If horses or oxen had hands and could draw or make statues, horses would represent the forms of gods as horses, oxen as oxen."" Galen (130?–201?) revived interest in fossils that had been rejected by Aristotle, and the speculations of Xenophanes were again viewed with favor.
470 BC. Democritus of Abdera (Greek, 470–370 BC) made dissections of many animals and humans. He was the first Greek philosopher-scientist to propose a classification of animals, dividing them into blooded animals (Vertebrata) and bloodless animals (Evertebrata). He also held that lower animals had perfected organs and that the brain was the seat of thought.
460 BC. Hippocrates (Greek, 460?–377? BC), the ""Father of Medicine"", used animal dissections to advance human anatomy. Fifty books attributed to him were assembled in Alexandria in the 3rd century BC. These probably represent the works of several authors, but the treatments given are usually conservative.
440 BC. Herodotus of Halikarnassos (Greek, 484–425 BC) treated exotic fauna in his Historia, but his accounts are often based on tall tales. He explored the Nile, but much of ancient Egyptian civilization was already lost to living memory by his time.
384 BC. Aristotle (Greek, 384–322 BC) studied under Plato, but he was not reluctant to disagree with the master. His books Historia Animalium (9 books), , and  set the zoological stage for centuries. He emphasized the value of direst observation, recognized law and order in biological phenomena, and derived conclusions inductively from observed facts. He believed that there was a natural scale that ran from simple to complex. He made advances in the area of marine biology, basing his writings on keen observation and rational interpretation as well as conversations with local Lesbos fishermen for two years, beginning in 344 BC. His account of male protection of eggs by the barking catfish was scorned for centuries until Louis Agassiz confirmed Aristotle's description. Aristotle's botanical works are lost, but those of his botanical student Theophrastos of Eresos (372–288 BC) are still available (Inquiry into Plants).
340 BC. Plato (Greek, 427–347 BC) held that animals existed to serve man, but they should not be mistreated because this would lead people to mistreat other people. Others who have echoed this opinion are St. Thomas Aquinas, Immanuel Kant, and Albert Schweitzer.

323 BC. Alexander the Great (Macedonian, 356–323 BC) collected animals, some perhaps for his old teacher Aristotle, when he was not busy conquering the known world. He is credited with the introduction of the peacock into Europe. Aside from its decorative tail feathers, the peacock (a pheasant) was eaten regularly by Europeans until the arrival of the turkey. (Charlemagne is said to have served thousands at a single bash.)
95 BC. Lucretius (Titus Lucretius Carus) (Roman, 96?–55 BC) spent his whole life writing one poem (still unfinished), called De Rerum Natura, with a version of the atomic theory, a theory of heredity, etc.
70 BC. Publius Vergilius Maro (Virgil) (70–19 BC) was a famous Roman poet. His poems Bucolics (42–37 BC) and Georgics (37–30 BC) hold much information on animal husbandry and farm life. His Aeneid (published posthumously) has many references to the zoology of his time.
36 BC. Marcus Terentius Varro (116–27 BC) wrote , a treatise that includes apiculture. He also treated the problem of sterility in the mule and recorded a rare instance in which a fertile mule was bred.
50. Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Roman, 4 BC–AD 65), tutor to Roman emperor Nero, maintained that animals have no reason, just instinct, a ""stoic"" position. He remarked on the ability of glass globes filled with water to magnify small objects.

77. Pliny the Elder (Roman, 23–79) wrote his  in 37 volumes. This work is a catch-all of zoological folklore, superstitions, and some good observations.
79. Pliny the Younger (Roman, 62–113), nephew of Pliny the Elder, inherited his uncle's notes and wrote on beekeeping.
100. Plutarch (Roman, 46?–120) stated that animals' behavior is motivated by reason and understanding. Life of the ant mirrors the virtues of friendship, sociability, endurance, courage, moderation, prudence, and justice.
131. Galen of Pergamum (Greek, 131?–201?), physician to Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, wrote on human anatomy from dissections of animals. His texts were used for hundreds of years, gaining the reputation of infallibility.
200 c. Various compilers in post-classical and medieval times added to the  (or, more popularly, the Bestiary), the major book on animals for hundreds of years. Animals were believed to exist in order to serve man, if not as food or slaves then as moral examples.

Middle Ages

600 c. Isidorus Hispalensis (Spanish bishop of Seville) (560–636) wrote , a compendium on animals that served until the rediscovery of Aristotle and Pliny. Full of errors, it nevertheless was influential for hundreds of years. He also wrote .
781. Al-Jahiz (Afro-Arab, 781–868/869), a scholar at Basra, wrote on the influence of environment on animals.
901. Horses came into wider use in those parts of Europe where the three-field system produces grain surpluses for feed, but hay-fed oxen were more economical, if less efficient, in terms of time and labor and remained almost the sole source of animal power in southern Europe, where most farmers continued to use the two-field system.

1114. Gerard of Cremona (1114–1187), after the capture of Toledo and its libraries from the Moors, translated Ptolemy, Aristotle, Euclid, Hippocrates, Galen, Pliny and many other classical authors from the Arabic.
1244–1248. Frederick II von Hohenstaufen (Holy Roman Emperor) (1194–1250) wrote  (The Art of Hunting with Birds) as a practical guide to ornithology. Hawking was the sport for royalty in those days.

1244. Vincentius Bellovacensis (Vincent of Beauvais) (?–1264) wrote  (1244–1254), a major encyclopedia of the 13th century. This work comprises three huge volumes, of 80 books and 9,885 chapters.
1248. Thomas of Cantimpré‚ (Fleming, 1204?–1275?) wrote , a major 13th-century encyclopedia.
1254–1323. Marco Polo (Italian, 1254–1323) provided information on Asiatic fauna, revealing new animals to Europeans. ""Unicorns"" (rhinos?) were reported from southern China, but fantastic animals were otherwise not included.
1255–1270. Albertus Magnus of Cologne (Bavarian, 1206?–1280) (Albert von Bollstaedt or St. Albert) wrote . He promoted Aristotle but also included new material on the perfection and intelligence of animals, especially bees.
1304–1309. Petrus de Crescentii wrote , a practical manual for agriculture with many accurate observations on insects and other animals. Apiculture was discussed at length.
1453. The fall of Constantinople to the Turks ended the Byzantine Empire. Greek manuscripts became known in Europe, including books by Aristotle and Theophrastos that were translated into Latin by Theodore Gaza (Greek, ?–1478).

1492–1555. Edward Wotton (English, 1492–1555) wrote , a well thought-out work that influenced Gesner.
1492. Christopher Columbus (Italian) arrives in the New World. New animals soon begin to overload European zoology. Columbus is said to have introduced cattle, horses, and eight pigs from the Canary Islands to Hispaniola in 1493, giving rise to virtual devastation of that and other islands. Pigs were often set ashore by sailors to provide food on the ship's later return. Feral populations of hogs were often dangerous to humans.
1500 c. Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bambastus von Hohenheim) (Swiss or German?, 1493–1541), alchemist, wrote that poisons should be used against disease: he recommended mercury for treating syphilis.
1519–1520. Bernal Diaz del Castillo (Spanish, 1450?–1500), chronicler of Cortez's conquest of Mexico, commented on the zoological gardens of Aztec ruler Montezuma (1466–1520), a marvel with parrots, rattlesnakes, etc.
1523. Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés(Spanish, 1478–1557), appointed official historiographer of the Indies in 1523, wrote Sumario de la Natural Historia delas Indias (Toledo, 1527). He was the first to describe many New World animals, such as the tapir, opossum, manatee, iguana, armadillo, ant-eaters, sloth, pelican, humming birds, etc.

Modern world

1551–1555. Pierre Belon (French, 1517–1564) wrote  (1551) and  (1555). This latter work included 110 animal species and offered many new observations and corrections to Herodotus.  (1555) was his picture book, with improved animal classification and accurate anatomical drawings. In this he published a man's and a bird's skeleton side by side to show the resemblance. He discovered an armadillo shell in a market in Syria, showing how Islam was distributing the finds from the New World.
1551. Conrad Gessner (Swiss, 1516–1565) wrote  (Tiguri, 4 vols., 1551–1558, last volume published in 1587) and gained renown. This work, although uncritically compiled in places, was consulted for over 200 years. He also wrote  (1553) and  (1563).
1554–1555. Guillaume Rondelet (French, 1507–1566) wrote  (1554) and  (1555). He gathered vernacular names in hope of being able to identify the animal in question. He did go to print with discoveries that disagreed with Aristotle.
1574. Johannes Faber (1576–1629), an early entomologist and member of the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome, gave the microscope its name.
1578. Jean de Lery (French, 1534–1611) was a member of the French colony at Rio de Janeiro. He published  (1578) with observations on the local fauna.
1585. Thomas Harriot (English, 1560–1621) was a naturalist with the first attempted English colony in North America, on Roanoke Island, North Carolina. His Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (1590) describes the black bear, gray squirrel, hare, otter, opossum, raccoon, skunk, Virginia and mule deer, turkeys, horseshoe crab (Limulus), etc.
1589. José de Acosta (Spanish, 1539–1600) wrote  (1589) and  (1590), describing many previously unknown animals from the New World.

17th century
1600. In Italy a spider scare lead to hysteria and the tarantella dance by which the body cures itself through physical exertions.
1602. Ulysses Aldrovandi (Italian, 1522–1605) wrote . This and his other works include much nonsense, but he used wing and leg morphology to construct his classification of insects. He is more highly regarded for his ornithological contributions.
1604–1614. Francisco Hernández de Toledo (Spanish) was sent to study Mexican biota in 1593–1600, by Philip II of Spain. His notes were published in Mexico in 1604 and 1614, describing many animals for the first time: coyote, buffalo, axolotl, porcupine, pronghorn antelope, horned lizard, bison, peccary and the toucan. He also figured many animals for the first time: ocelot, rattlesnake, manatee, alligator, armadillo, and the pelican.
1607 (1612?). Captain John Smith (English), head of the Jamestown colony, wrote A Map of Virginia in which he describes the physical features of the country, its climate, plants and animals, and inhabitants. He describes the raccoon, muskrat, flying squirrel, as well as a score of animals, all well identifiable. (In 1609 the Jamestown, Virginia, colony was almost lost when settlers found that their stores had been devoured by rats from English ships.)
1617. Garcilaso de la Vega (Peruvian Spanish, 1539–1617) wrote Royal Commentaries of Peru, containing descriptions of the condor, ocelots, puma, viscacha, tapir, rhea, skunk, llama, huanaco, paca, and vicuña.
1620? North American colonists probably introduced the European honeybee, Apis mellifera, into Virginia. By the 1640s these insects were also in Massachusetts. They became feral and advanced through eastern North America before the settlers.
1628. William Harvey (English, 1578–1657) published  (1628) with the doctrine of the circulation of blood (an inference made by him in about 1616).
1634. William Wood (English) wrote New England Prospect (1634) in which he describes New England's fauna.
1637. Thomas Morton (English, c. 1579–1647) wrote New English Canaan (1637) with treatments of 26 species of mammals, 32 birds, 20 fishes and 8 marine invertebrates.

1648. Georg Marcgrave (?–1644) was a German astronomer working for Johann Moritz, Count Maurice of Nassau, in the Dutch colony set up in northeastern Brazil. His  (1648) contains the best early descriptions of many Brazilian animals. Marcgrave used Tupi names that were later Latinized by Linnaeus in the 13th edition of the Systema Naturae. The biological and linguistic data could have come from Moraes, a Brazilian Jesuit priest turned apostate.
1651. William Harvey published  (1651) with the aphorism  on the title page.
1661. Marcello Malpighi (Italian, 1628–1694) discovered capillaries (1661), structures predicted to exist by Harvey some thirty years earlier. Malpighi was the founder of microanatomy. He studied, among other things, the anatomy of the silkworm (1669) and the development of the chick (1672).
1662. John Graunt (English) provided the beginnings of demography with his Natural and Political Observations ... made upon the Bills of Mortality (1662). His speculations on Adam's and Eve's descendants and their growth rates showed an understanding of geometrical population increase. He found that more males than females were born, a fact considered by Sir Matthew Hale as providential for the ""needs of warfare"".
1665. Robert Hooke (English, 1635–1703) wrote Micrographia (1665, 88 plates), with his early microscopic studies. He coined the term ""cell"".
1668. Francesco Redi (Italian, 1621–1697) wrote  (1668) and  (1708). His refutation of spontaneous generation in flies is still considered a model in experimentation.
1669. Jan Swammerdam (Dutch, 1637–1680) wrote  (1669) describing metamorphosis in insects and supporting the performation doctrine. He was a pioneer in microscopic studies. He gave the first description of red blood corpuscles and discovered the valves of lymph vessels. His work was unknown and unacknowledged until after his death.
1672. Regnier de Graaf (1641–1673) reported that he had traced the human egg from the ovary down the fallopian tube to the uterus. What he really saw was the follicle.
1675–1722. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (Dutch, 1632–1723) wrote , a treatise with early observations made with microscopes. He discovered blood corpuscles, striated muscles, human spermatozoa (1677), protozoa (1674), bacteria (1683), rotifers, etc.
1691. John Ray (English, 1627–1705) wrote  (1693),  (1710), and The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation (1691). He tried to classify different animal species into groups largely according to their toes and teeth.
1699. Edward Tyson (English, 1650–1708) wrote  (or Anatomy of a Pygmie Compared with that of a Monkey, an Ape and a Man) (1699), his anatomical study of the primate. This was the first detailed and accurate study of the higher apes. Other studies by Tyson include the female porpoise, male rattlesnake, tapeworm, roundworm (Ascaris), peccary and opossum.

18th century
1700? Discovery of the platypus in Australia.
1700. Félix de Azara (Spanish) estimated the feral herds of cattle on the South American pampas at 48 million animals. These animals probably descended from herds introduced by the Jesuits some 100 years earlier. (North America and Australia were to follow in this pattern, where feral herds of cattle and mustangs would explode, become pests, and reform the frontier areas.)

1705. Maria Sybilla Merian (German, 1647–1717) wrote and beautifully illustrated her  () (1705). In this book she stated that Fulgora lanternaria was luminous.
1730? Sir Hans Sloane (English (born Ireland), 1660–1753) was a founder of the British Museum.
1734–1742. René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur (French, 1683–1756) was an early entomologist. His  (6 volumes) shows the best of zoological observation at the time. He invented the glass-fronted bee hive.
1740. Abraham Trembley, Swiss naturalist, discovered the hydra which he considered to combine both animal and plant characteristics. His  (1744) showed that freshwater polyps of Hydra could be sectioned or mutilated and still reform. Regeneration soon became a topic of inquiry among Réaumur, Bonnet, Spallanzini and others.
1745. Charles Bonnet (French-Swiss, 1720–1793) wrote  (1745) and  (1732). He confirmed parthenogenesis of aphids.
1745. Pierre Louis M. de Maupertuis (French, 1698–1759) went to Lapland to measure the arc of the meridian (1736–1737). Maupertuis was a Newtonian. He generated family trees for inheritable characteristics (e.g., haemophilia in European royal families) and showed inheritance through both the male and female lines. He was an early evolutionist and head of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. In 1744 he proposed the theory that molecules from all parts of the body were gathered into the gonads (later called ""pangenesis"").  was published anonymously in 1745. Maupertuis wrote  in which he suggests a survival of the fittest concept: ""Could not one say that since, in the accidental combination of Nature's productions, only those could survive which found themselves provided with certain appropriate relationships, it is no wonder that these relationships are present in all the species that actually exist? These species which we see today are only the smallest part of those which a blind destiny produced.""
1748. John Tuberville Needham, an English naturalist, wrote Observations upon the Generation, Composition, and Decomposition of Animal and Vegetable Substances in which he offers ""proof"" of spontaneous generation. Needham found flasks of broth teeming with ""little animals"" after having boiled them and sealed them, but his experimental techniques were faulty.
1748–1751. Peter Kalm (Swede) was a naturalist and student of Linnaeus. He traveled in North America (1748–1751).

1749–1804. Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (French, 1707–1788) wrote  (1749–1804 in 44 vols.) that had a great impact on zoology. He asserted that species were mutable. Buffon also drew attention to vestigial organs. He held that spermatozoa were ""living organic molecules"" that multiplied in the semen.
1758. Albrecht von Haller (Swiss, 1708–1777) was one of the founders of modern physiology. His work on the nervous system was revolutionary. He championed animal physiology, along with human physiology. See his textbook  (1758).
1758. Carl Linnaeus (Swedish, 1707–1778) published the  whose tenth edition (1758) is the starting point of binomial nomenclature for zoology.
1759. Caspar Friedrich Wolff (1733–1794) wrote  (1759) that disagreed with the idea of preformation. He supported the doctrine of epigenesis. A youthful follower of the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646–1716), Wolff sought to resolve the problem of hybrids (mule, hinny, apemen) in his epigenesis, since these could not be well explained by performation.
1768. Sir Joseph Banks (1743–1820) and Daniel Solander (1733–1782) sailed with Captain James Cook (English, 1728–1779) on the H.M.S. Endeavour for the South Seas (Tahiti), until 1771.

1769. Edward Bancroft (English) wrote An Essay on the Natural History of Guyana in South America (1769) and advanced the theory that flies transmit disease.
1771. Johann Reinhold Forster (German, 1729–1798) was the naturalist on Cook's second voyage around the world (1772–1775). He published a Catalogue of the Animals of North America (1771) as an addendum to Kalm's Travels. He also studied the birds of Hudson Bay.
1774. Gilbert White (English) wrote The natural history and antiquities of Selborne, in the county of Southampton (1774) with fine ornithological observations on migration, territoriality and flocking.
1775. Johan Christian Fabricius (Danish, 1745–1808) wrote  (1775),  (1776),  (1778),  (1792–1794, in six vols.), and later publications (to 1805), to make Fabricius one of the world's greatest entomologists.
1776. René Dutrochet (French, 1776–1832) proposed an early version of the cell theory.
1780. Lazaro Spallanzani (Italian, 1729–1799) performed artificial fertilization in the frog, silkmoth and dog. He concluded from filtration experiments that spermatozoa were necessary for fertilization. In 1783 he showed that human digestion was a chemical process since gastric juices in and outside the body liquefied food (meat). He used himself as the experimental animal. His work to disprove spontaneous generation in microbes was resisted by John Needham (English priest, 1713–1781).
1780. Antoine Lavoisier (French, 1743–1794) and Pierre Laplace (French, 1749–1827) wrote Memoir on heat. Animal respiration was a form of combustion, a conclusion reached by this discoverer of Oxygen.

1783–1792. Alexandre Rodrigues Ferreira (Brazilian) undertook biological exploration. He wrote . His specimens were taken by Saint-Hilaire from Lisbon to the Paris Museum during the Napoleonic invasion of Portugal. He is considered the ""Brazilian Humboldt"".
1784. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (German) wrote  (1795) that promoted the idea of archetypes to which animals should be compared. Vitalist and romantic, his zoology mostly follows Lorenz Oken.
1784. Thomas Jefferson (American) wrote Notes on the State of Virginia (1784) that refuted some of Buffon's mistakes about New World fauna. As U.S. President, he dispatched the Lewis and Clark expedition to the American West (1804).
1789? Guillaume Antoine Olivier (French, 1756–1814) wrote , or  (1789).
1789. George Shaw & Frederick Polydore Nodder published The Naturalist's Miscellany: or coloured figures of natural objects drawn and described immediately from nature (1789–1813) in 24 volumes with hundreds of color plates.
1792. François Huber made original observations on honeybees. In his  (1792) he noted that the first eggs laid by queen bees develop into drones if her nuptial flight had been delayed and that her last eggs would also give rise to drones. He also noted that rare worker eggs develop into drones. This anticipated by over 50 years the discovery by Jan Dzierżon that drones come from unfertilized eggs and queen and worker bees come from fertilized eggs.
1793. Lazaro Spallanzani (Italian, 1729–1799) conducted experiments on the orientation of bats and owls in the dark.

1794. Erasmus Darwin (English, grandfather of Charles Darwin) wrote Zoönomia, or the Laws of Organic Life (1794) in which he advanced the idea that environmental influences could transform species.
1795. James Hutton (English) wrote Theory of the Earth (1795) in which he interpreted certain geological strata as former sea beds.
1796–1829. Pierre André Latreille (French, 1762–1833) sought to provide a ""natural"" system for the classification of animals, in his many monographs on invertebrates.  (1811) was devoted to insects collected by Humboldt and Bonpland.
1798. Thomas Robert Malthus (English, 1766–1834) wrote Essay on the Principle of Population (1798), a book that was important to both Darwin and Wallace.
1799. George Shaw (English) provided the first description of the duck-billed platypus. Everard Home (1802) provided the first complete description.
1799–1803. Alexander von Humboldt (German, 1769–1859) and Aimé Jacques Alexandre Goujaud Bonpland (French) arrived in Venezuela in 1799. Humboldt's Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial Regions of America during the years 1799–1803 and Kosmos were very influential in his time and since.
1799. Georges Cuvier (French, 1769–1832) established comparative anatomy as a field of study. He also founded the science of paleontology. He wrote  (1801–1805),  (1816),  (1812–1813). He believed in the fixity of species and the Biblical Flood. His early  (1798) was influential, but it did not include Cuvier's major contributions to animal classification.
1799. American hunters killed the last bison in the American East, in Pennsylvania.

19th century

1802. Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (French, 1744–1829) wrote  and  (1809). He was an early evolutionist and organized invertebrate paleontology. While Lamarck's contributions to science include work in meteorology, botany, chemistry, geology, and paleontology, he is best known for his work in invertebrate zoology and his theoretical work on evolution. He published an impressive seven-volume work,  (""Natural history of animals without backbones""; 1815–1822).
1813–1818. William Charles Wells (Scottish-American, 1757–1817) was the first to recognise the principle of natural selection. He read a paper to the Royal Society in 1813 (but not published until 1818) which used the idea to explain differences between human races. The application was limited to the question of how different skin colours arose.
1815. William Kirby and William Spence (English) wrote An Introduction to Entomology (first edition in 1815). This was the first modern entomology text.
1817. Georges Cuvier wrote Le Règne Animal (Paris).
1817–1820. Johann Baptist von Spix (German, 1781–1826) and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (German) conducted Brazilian zoological and botanical explorations (1817–1820). See their  (3 vols., 1823–1831).
1817. William Smith, in his Strategraphical System of Organized Fossils (1817) showed that certain strata have characteristic series of fossils.

1817. Thomas Say (American, 1787–1834) was a brilliant young systematic zoologist until he moved to the utopian community at New Harmony, Indiana, in 1825. Luckily, most of his insect collections have been recovered.
William Lawrence (English, 1783–1867) published a book of his lectures to the Royal College of Surgeons in 1819. The book contains a remarkably clear rejection of Lamarckism (soft inheritance), proto-evolutionary ideas about the origin of mankind, and a forthright denial of the 'Jewish scriptures' (= Old Testament). He was forced to suppress the book after the Lord Chancellor refused copyright and other powerful men made threatening remarks. His subsequent life was highly successful.
1824. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is founded at London.
1825. Gideon Mantell (English) wrote ""Notice on the Iguanodon, a newly discovered fossil reptile, from the sandstone of Tilgate Forest, in Sussex"" (Phil. Trans. Roy, Soc. Lond., 115: 179–186), the first paper on dinosaurs. The name dinosaur was coined by anatomist Richard Owen.
1826. The Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park is founded by the Zoological Society of London with help from Sir Thomas Raffles. It opened its ""zoo"" to the public for two days a week beginning April 27, 1828, with the first hippopotamus to be seen in Europe since the ancient Romans showed one at the Coliseum. The Society will help save bird and animal species from extinction.
1826–1839. John James Audubon (Haitian-born American, 1785–1851) wrote Birds of America (1826–1839), with North American bird portraits and studies. See also his posthumously published volume on North American. Quadrupeds, written with his sons and the naturalist John Bachman, The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America (1845–1854) with 150 folio plates.
1827. Karl Ernst von Baer (Russian embryologist, 1792–1876) was the founder of comparative embryology. He demonstrated the existence of the mammalian ovum, and he proposed the germ-layer theory. His major works include  (1827) and  (1828; 1837).
1829. James Smithson (English, 1765–1829) donated seed money in his will for the founding of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
1830–1833. Sir Charles Lyell (English, 1797–1875) wrote Principles of Geology and gave the time needed for evolution to work. Darwin took this book to sea on the Beagle. Past environments were probably much more perturbed than Lyell admitted.
1830. Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (French, 1772–1844) wrote  (1830).
1831–1836. Charles Darwin (English, 1809–1882) and Captain Robert FitzRoy (English) went to sea as the original odd couple. Darwin's report is generally known as The Voyage of the Beagle.
1832. Thomas Nuttall (American?, 1786–1859) wrote A Manual of the Ornithology of the United States and Canada (1832) that was to become the standard text on the subject for most of the 19th century.

1835. William Swainson (English, 1789–1855) wrote A Treatise on the Geography and Classification of Animals (1835) in which he used ad hoc land bridges to explain animal distributions. He included some interesting, second-hand observations on Old World army ants.
1836. William Buckland (English, 1784–1856) wrote Geology and Mineralogy Considered with Reference to natural Theology (1836) in which he stated that there were several creations.
1839. Theodor Schwann (German, 1810–1882) wrote  (1839). With him the cell theory was made general.
1839. Louis Agassiz (Swiss-American, 1807–1873) arrived in the U.S. A former student of Cuvier, Louis Agassiz was an expert on fossil fishes. He founded the Museum of Comparative Zoology, at Harvard University, and became Darwin's North American opposition. He was a popularizer of natural history and exhorted students to ""study nature, not books"". His  (1842–1847) was a pioneering effort.
1840. Jan Evangelista Purkyně, a Czech physiologist, at Wrocław proposes that the word ""protoplasm"" be applied to the formative material of young animal embryos.

1842. Baron Justus von Liebig wrote  in which he applied classic methodology to studying animal tissues, suggested that animal heat is produced by combustion, and founded the science of biochemistry.
1843. John James Audubon, age 58, ascended the Missouri River to Fort Union at the mouth of the Yellowstone to sketch wild animals.
1844. Robert Chambers (Scottish, 1802–1871) wrote the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844) in which he included early evolutionary considerations. The most primitive species originated by spontaneous generation, but these gave rise to more advanced ones. This book, anonymously published, had a profound effect on Wallace. Evolution ""was the manner in which the Divine Author has been pleased to work"".
1845. von Siebold recognized Protozoa as single-celled animals.
1848. Josiah C. Nott (American), a physician from New Orleans, published his belief that mosquitoes transmitted malaria.
1848. Alfred Russel Wallace (British, 1823–1913) and Henry W. Bates (English, 1825–1892) arrived in the Amazon River valley in 1848. Bates stayed until 1859, exploring the upper Amazon. Wallace remained in the Amazon until 1852, exploring the Rio Negro. Wallace wrote A Narrative of Travels on the Amazon and Rio Negro (1853), and Bates wrote The Naturalist on the River Amazons (1863). Later (1854–1862), Wallace went to the Far East, reported in his The Malay Archipelago (1869).
1849. Arnold Adolph Berthold demonstrated by castration and testicular transplant that the testis produces a blood-borne substance promoting male secondary sexual characteristics.
1850? Thomas Hardwicke (British naturalist) discovered the lesser panda (Ailurus fulgens) in northern India.
1855. Alfred Russel Wallace (English, 1823–1913) wrote On the law which has regulated the introduction of new species (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist., September 1855) with evolutionary ideas that drew upon Wallace's experiences in the Amazon.
1857. Discovery of Neanderthal skull-cap.
1857–1881. Henri Milne-Edwards (French, 1800–1885) introduced the idea of physiologic division of labor and wrote a treatise on comparative anatomy and physiology (1857–1881).

1859. Charles Darwin publishes On the Origin of Species, explaining the mechanism of evolution by natural selection and founding the field of evolutionary biology.
 1864. Louis Pasteur disproved the spontaneous generation of cellular life.
 1865. Gregor Mendel demonstrated in pea plants that inheritance follows definite rules. The Principle of Segregation states that each organism has two genes per trait, which segregate when the organism makes eggs or sperm. The Principle of Independent Assortment states that each gene in a pair is distributed independently during the formation of eggs or sperm. Mendel's trailblazing foundation for the science of genetics went unnoticed, to his lasting disappointment.
 1869. Friedrich Miescher discovered nucleic acids in the nuclei of cells.
 1876. Oskar Hertwig and Hermann Fol independently described (in sea urchin eggs) the entry of sperm into the egg and the subsequent fusion of the egg and sperm nuclei to form a single new nucleus.
 1892. Hans Driesch separated the individual cells of a 2-cell sea urchin embryo and shows that each cell develops into a complete individual, thus disproving the theory of preformation and showing that each cell is ""totipotent,"" containing all the hereditary information necessary to form an individual.

20th century

1900–1949
 1900. Three  biologists Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, Erich von Tschermak independently rediscovered Mendel's paper on heredity.
 1905. William Bateson coined the term ""genetics"" to describe the study of biological inheritance.
 1907. Ivan Pavlov demonstrated conditioned responses with salivating dogs.
 1922. Aleksandr Oparin proposed that the Earth's early atmosphere contained methane, ammonia, hydrogen, and water vapour, and that these were the raw materials for the origin of life.
 1935. Konrad Lorenz described the imprinting behavior of young birds.
 1937. In Genetics and the Origin of Species, Theodosius Dobzhansky applies the chromosome theory and population genetics to natural populations in the first mature work of neo-Darwinism, also called the modern synthesis, a term coined by Julian Huxley.

 1938. A living coelacanth was found off the coast of southern Africa.
 1940. Donald Griffin and Robert Galambos announced their discovery of echolocation by bats.

1950–1999
 1952. American developmental biologists Robert Briggs and Thomas King cloned the first vertebrate by transplanting nuclei from leopard frog embryos into enucleated eggs. More differentiated cells were the less able they are to direct development in the enucleated egg.
 1961. Joan Oró found that concentrated solutions of ammonium cyanide in water can produce the nucleotide adenine, a discovery that opened the way for theories on the origin of life.
 1967. John Gurdon used nuclear transplantation to clone an African clawed frog; first cloning of a vertebrate using a nucleus from a fully differentiated adult cell.
 1972. Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge proposed an idea called ""punctuated equilibrium"", which states that the fossil record is an accurate depiction of the pace of evolution, with long periods of ""stasis"" (little change) punctuated by brief periods of rapid change and species formation (within a lineage).
 1996. Dolly the sheep was first clone of an adult mammal.

"Margaret Harrison

Margaret Harrison (born 1940 in Wakefield, Yorkshire, England) is an English feminist and artist whose work uses a variety of media and subject matter.

Life and work
Originally born in Yorkshire, when her father returned from the war, her family moved first to Bridlington, then to Cumbria.

Harrison studied at the Carlisle College of Art from 1957 to 1961; the Royal Academy Schools, London, England, from 1961 to 1964; and graduated from the Perugia Fine Arts Academy, Italy, in 1965.

She founded the London Women's Liberation Art Group in 1970. A 1971 exhibition of her work that was closed by the police included a piece depicting Hugh Hefner as a naked Bunny girl.

Between 1973 and 1975 she collaborated with artists Kay Hunt and Mary Kelly to conduct a study of women's work in a metal box factory in Bermondsey, London. They presented their findings in 1975 in the installation Women and Work: A Document on the Division of Labour in Industry 1973-1975 that was first displayed at the South London Art Gallery in 1975. The exhibition told the stories of 150 working women who participated in the project and offers an account of the participants' relationship to the workplace, as well as reflections on the changes in labour and industry brought about by the Equal Pay Act (EPA), which had been passed in 1970.
 

Her work was included in the exhibition Issue: Social Strategies by Women Artists, curated by Lucy R. Lippard, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London in 1980. This important international group exhibition highlighted socially oriented feminist art practice and has been recognized as a key feminist exhibition. According to Chris Crickmay, Harrison’s work was amongst others coming into prominence “reflecting social concerns in that had not hitherto appeared in art galleries"".

Her work ""Beautiful Ugly Violence"" was described as ""a field day of juxtapositions, as the bright and almost cheery colors of her paintings counter the often subdued and sometimes deadly topic: the various means of committing violence against women.""

Harrison continues to work in both the United States and England and has exhibited in America, Switzerland, and Great Britain. Her work has been shown in the Museum of Contemporary Art and the Tate Modern. She was a Senior Research Professor and Director of the Social and Environmental Art Research Centre. 

In 2011 ""I am a Fantasy"", was exhibited at the PayneShurvell gallery in East London from 15 April to 21 May. Beverley Knowles curated the show.

In 2013, she won the Northern Art Prize 

In 2015, Harrison had a solo show at Ronald Feldman Gallery in New York.

A retrospective of her work “Margaret Harrison: Dialogues Between Sex, Class and Violence”  was held from October 2017 - January 2018 at the Azkuna Zentroa, Bilbao.

"Rochville University

Rochville University was an online diploma mill offering a ""Life Experience Degree, and Certificate Program"" without coursework or prior transcript evaluation. The State of Texas classified it as an ""illegal supplier of educational credentials"" whose degrees may not be used in Texas. The Oregon Office of Degree Authorization lists it as ""fake"". Its operation is believed to be centered in Pakistan, and its diplomas and degree certificates have been mailed from Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Along with many similar enterprises, it is owned by the Karachi based company, Axact, whose main business, according to a New York Times investigation, is ""to take the centuries-old scam of selling fake academic degrees and turn it into an Internet-era scheme on a global scale"".

The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board indicated in 2006 that Rochville, Belford University, and the agencies from which they claimed accreditation appeared to be operated by the same individuals. In 2012, a U.S. District Court ordered Belford University, Rochville University's sister operation, shut down and its founder pay $22.7 million in damages.

Accreditation status
Rochville University has claimed to be accredited by various organizations, but none are recognized higher education accreditors.  These have included the International Accreditation Agency for Online Universities (IAAOU), the Universal Council for Online Education Accreditation (UCOEA), the Board of Online Universities Accreditation (BOUA), and the World Online Education Accrediting Commission (WOEAC). The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board reported that Rochville University and the accreditation boards appeared to be operated by the same individuals. According to its website, the BOUA has accredited only one other institution, Ashwood University, which is believed to be Rochville University's sister operation.

Because Rochville University is not accredited by any recognized accreditation bodies in the United States, its degrees and credits are unlikely to be acceptable to employers or academic institutions. Jurisdictions that have restricted or made illegal the use of credentials from unaccredited schools include Oregon, Michigan, Maine, North Dakota, New Jersey, Washington, Nevada,Illinois,  Nevada statute NRS 394.700</ref> Indiana, and Texas. Many other states are also considering restrictions on the use of degrees from unaccredited institutions.

Criticism and controversy
Claims have been made that Rochville University is a fraudulent diploma mill.

According to GetEducated.com, an online learning consumer group, Rochville University operates under various aliases, including affordabledegrees.com. 

In 2009, GetEducated.com purchased an online MBA for its mascot, a dog named Chester Ludlow.  The news release indicates that $499 and a resume were submitted to Rochville in May and a week later the degree with a packet of corresponding paperwork arrived from Dubai showing that the dog  graduated with a 3.19 G.P.A.  In addition to the MBA diploma and transcripts, Chester received a ""certificate of distinction in finance and a certificate of membership in the student council"".

In 2005, investigators for CNN purchased a master's degree in chemistry from Rochville in the name of Abu Salsabil Hassan Omar, presumably an identity of their own creation.  Attempts to find a physical presence for Rochville failed. Its website was operated from Sarasota, Florida. The diploma received by the network was mailed from the United Arab Emirates.

There have also been concerns that some people may have used degrees obtained from Rochville and other online universities for fraudulent purposes. On 22 February 2007 Yorkshire police announced plans to re-investigate 700 court cases after the conviction of Gene Morrison, ""a fraudster who conned the courts for three decades by posing as a forensic expert."" Morrison was convicted of 22 counts involving his claimed education, including four counts of obtaining money by deception, seven counts of attempting to obtain property by deception, eight counts of perverting the course of justice or intending to pervert the course of justice, and three counts of perjury. The court ruled that his BSc degree in forensic science, a master's degree with excellence in forensic investigation and a doctorate in criminology from Rochville University in the United States were gained ""not from years of study and learning, but from accessing a website, www.affordabledegrees.com, and paying a fee.""

In 2011, firefighters who had purchased degrees from diploma mills to get raises were having their raises revoked. Rochville University was listed as one of the institutions that had provided degrees.  In Guam, a Rochville online degree was determined to be inadequate to meet the educational requirements for the position of chief of police.

Connection with Belford University
The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board indicated in 2006 that Rochville, Belford University, and the agencies from which they claimed accreditation appeared to be operated by the same people. In August 2012, a U.S. District Court ordered Belford University, Rochville University's sister operation, shut down and its founder, Salem Kureshi, pay $22.7 million in damages. Court documents revealed that Belford University was run by 30-year-old Salem Kureshi from his apartment in Karachi, Pakistan. The court found that Kureshi ""operates a sophisticated internet ripoff scheme through various websites, which falsely represent the existence of an accredited and legitimate high school, whose diplomas will be widely accepted by employers, professional associations, other schools, colleges and universities.""

"Rattler Race

Rattler Race is a snake video game, created in 1991 by Christopher Lee Fraley. It is similar to the 1982 apple-eating game Snake Byte, but with the addition of enemy snakes. It was distributed with the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 2, which was included with early Microsoft Windows systems. The player takes on the role of a hungry snake, who must eat all the apples in each level, whilst avoiding the hazards.

Levels 
There are 30 levels of increasing difficulty. The player can begin at any level by using the level selection window, which shows a simple preview of the layout. When the level is created, a timer is started and apples appear in random places. When all the apples are eaten, the player's snake exits through a hole to complete the level. Four factors affect the difficulty of each level.

Enemy snakes make navigating around the level harder, because running into them will kill the player's snake. The player can select the number of enemy snakes, from zero to three. If an enemy snake reaches the open exit hole before the player, the hole closes and the level restarts.

Walls will kill the snake, if it runs into them. Careful planning of routes (to avoid running into walls) is necessary at higher levels when the snake has grown in size.

Bouncing balls are lethal if they hit the head of a snake. They will harmlessly bounce off the bodies of the snakes and walls of the levels. The player can select the number of balls that appear in the game, from zero to three.

Timer freezes appear sporadically, which will temporarily pause the timer to allow the player to get more points.

Score 
The score can be increased by completing levels and eating apples. The player can also gain points by trapping and killing an enemy snake, which is done by forcing the enemy snake into a dead end. The enemy snakes can reduce the players score by eating the apples.

Gold apples will randomly appear, which are worth more points than regular apples. However, if an enemy snake eats a gold apple, the player loses more points. If the player has selected enemy snakes, balls or both to appear in the level, additional points are rewarded for some actions.

If the timer is active, the player gets more points for eating apples and completing the level.

The player begins with three lives. An extra life is given each time the player gets to a score ending in 50, such as 50, 250 or 550.

Difficulty level 
The player can select a difficulty level from Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced to Expert. This determines the speed of the game and affects the numbers of points gained from certain actions. The game's settings are stored in the following file: C:\Windows\EntPack.ini (Entertainment Pack). One nice feature is being able to change the size of the playing screen by changing the value of ""Size"" to ""1"".

"Heads And Tails

Heads and Tails is a solitaire card game which uses two decks of playing cards. It is mostly based on luck.

First, a row of eight cards are dealt; this is the ""Heads"" row. Then 8 piles of 11 cards are dealt; this is reserve. Below them is another row of eight cards, the ""Tails"" row.

The object of the game is to free one Ace and one King of each suit and build each of them by suit; the Aces are built up to Kings while the Kings are built down to Aces.

Only the cards on the Heads and Tails rows are available to play on the foundations or on either the Heads or Tails row; the eight piles are used only to fill gaps. The cards on the Heads or Tails rows can be built either up or down by suit; building can change direction, but Aces cannot be built onto Kings and vice versa.

When a gap occurs on either the Heads or the Tails row, it is filled by the top card of the reserve pile immediately below or above it (depending on which row the gap is). But when a gap occurs above or below an empty pile, two different rule sets say the gap is filled with:
The top card of the pile to the immediate left of the empty pile (Solsuite, BVS Solitaire Collection)
The top card of any other pile. (Pretty Good Solitaire)

The game is won when all cards are built onto the foundations.

"Disjunctive cognition

Disjunctive cognition is a common phenomenon in dreams, first identified by psychoanalyst Mark Blechner, in which two aspects of cognition do not match each other. The dreamer is aware of the disjunction, yet that does not prevent it from remaining. From Dr. Mark Blechner's The Dream Frontier, it states ""The specifics of bizarre dream experiences may be a source of data about the different levels of perceptual processing"". By careful examination of the experiences in dreams, we may gain insight into the workings of our mind/brains.The most frequent disjunction is between appearance and identity, such as ""I knew it was my mother, even though it didn't look like her.""
The dreamer recognizes a character's identity, even though the appearance does not match the identity. Character identity relates to facial recognition. In Blechner's The Dream Frontier he says ""One theory of facial recognition is that the visual information passes from the retina through the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate nucleus and thence to the cortex, for discrimination of the features by the feature discrimination area"".  This is one example of data that can help validate Blechner's idea. He stated it is ""a far-reaching hypothesis and will require a great deal of research to test it.""  But, another piece of data to support it is that people almost always start off a recollection of a dream as ""It was the strangest thing"" Such dreams are usually not experienced as bizarre, despite the fact that such a statement in waking life would be considered psychotic. In waking life, most people would assume that they misidentified the person and correct for it, but not in dreams. An example of disjunctive cognition is ""I was the opposite of what I actually look like. I was tall and lanky like Katharine Hepburn, but not particularly attractive (Fosshage and Loew, 1987, p. 10).” 

Disjunctive cognition can also involve time perception. It is quite common to dream that as an adult, one goes back to a time and place of one's childhood. In this case, the perceived age of the dreamer is disjunctive with the setting of the dream. It is much less common to perceive the opposite: dreaming of oneself as a child, where the time and place are that of one's adulthood. However, it is common to dream of other people whom one knew at an earlier age appearing in the present. This is especially frequent in the dreams of people who have lost close relatives. For example, Aharon Appelfeld reported: ""I dreamed about my parents. They had not aged since we were together sixty-three years ago in Prague, and their faces expressed amazement that I had grown older. We were briefly united in mutual astonishment, and I knew that I had something important to tell them. But, as in every profound dream, I could not get the words out.""

Blechner calls disjunctive cognitions ""the commonplace bizarreness of dreamlife."" Some things that happen in dreams feel bizarre to the dreamer, but disjunctive cognitions usually do not. Another commonplace bizarreness of dreams is the interobject, in which the dreamer sees something between two objects, as in: I dreamt of something ""between a swimming pool and an aqueduct,"" or ""between a cell-phone and a baby."" This has led researchers to ask how people determine a specific character in a dream is their ""mother"" or ""themselves"" if they do not physically appear to be. This can give insight on a person's experience with disjunctive cognition and with the person they dreamed about. The way they saw their mother could more or less be the way they viewed them from an emotional standpoint. It can also reflect the kind of relationship they had with their mother or with themselves.  This can also open up a bigger insight on the meaning of dreams and how our minds work through problems we have throughout the day.   
     
Disjunctive cognitions reveal much about how the brain is organized. Blechner has suggested that whenever disjunctive cognitions occur, the two aspects of cognition that are disjunctive are handled in different parts of the brain whose mutual integration is suppressed or shifted during sleep. Disjunctive cognitions between what the person looks like and who the person is suggest two brain systems for those aspects of perception. This is supported by research in neuropsychology and neurobiology. For example, some people who have suffered strokes or other brain damage have a syndrome known as prosopagnosia. A prosopagnosic man may look at his wife of 50 years, see all of her features clearly, and yet not recognize who she is. In such people, the process of seeing is intact, but the process of facial recognition is damaged. 

There is also the phenomenon of Capgras syndrome, in which a person may feel that a close relative is actually an impostor. The features of the relative are recognizable, but the person's identity is not. And there is also Fregoli delusion, in which a person may mistakenly identify strangers as people he actually knows. In all of these syndromes, there is a disjunction between the appearance and perceived identity of the person.

"Delfina de la Cruz

Delfina de la Cruz Zañartu (24 February 1837 Concepción, Chile – 8 May 1905 Concepción, Chile) was a Chilean pianist and First Lady of Chile. She was the only child of General José María de la Cruz and his wife Josefa Zañartu, and granddaughter of Chilean revolutionary Luis de la Cruz.

First Lady of Chile 

De la Cruz became engaged to Aníbal Pinto after he returned from a long trip in Europe, and they married on 24 November 1855 in Concepción. The marriage had political undertones; Pinto's father, Francisco Antonio Pinto, former President of Chile, felt that the marriage would help to heal the relationship between the cities of Concepción and Santiago. Animosity had arisen between the cities as a result of the 1851 Chilean Revolution, during which uprisings had taken place in Concepción against the central government based in Santiago. The marriage would create a familial link between de la Cruz's father, José Maria de la Cruz and Pinto's brother-in-law, Manuel Bulnes, who had fought against each other in the Battle of Loncomilla.

Pinto was elected President of Chile in 1876, and de la Cruz accompanied him to all government ceremonies, even inspecting the troops in his company during the War of the Pacific. 

De la Cruz was related by marriage to two other First Ladies of Chile: Enriqueta Pinto, Pinto's sister and wife of Manuel Bulnes, and Luisa Garmendia, Pinto's mother and wife of Fransico Antonio Pinto.

Musical Composition

De la Cruz was an accomplished pianist and composer. Under the pseudonym Delfina Perez, de la Cruz published 12 works throughout the 19th century, surpassed in volume only by Isidora Zegers. Her work was praised by local press in Valparaíso and Santiago, where she sometimes performed benefit concerts. Several of her pieces also attained international recognition, including The Star of Night (), a polka for piano which was played in Paris, as well as Armando the Gondolier (), a waltz for piano later performed in Germany. She is also the first Chilean woman to venture into the composition of choral music, at the time a male-dominated sphere.

"Marr Residence

The Marr Residence is a National Historic Site located in the Nutana neighborhood of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and was part of the original temperance colony that predated the city.  Built in 1884 for stonemason Alexander ""Sandy"" Marr, it is the oldest building in Saskatoon on its original site. It was one of several houses requisitioned as a field hospital to treat wounded soldiers during the North-West Rebellion in 1885. When the hospital was closed in 1885 the home was returned to the Marr family. Although they left Saskatoon in 1889, the Marr family name remained associated with the house. The house remained a residential property until the 1970s.

The Marr Residence was designated a municipal heritage property on January 11, 1982. It is noted for its blend of Second Empire and pioneer architecture, particularly its Mansard roof. The building is currently owned by the City of Saskatoon and run as a historic site by the Meewasin Valley Authority.
On July 4, 2016, the Marr Residence was designated a National Historic Site.

"Nathan Gregory Silvermaster

Nathan Gregory Silvermaster (November 27, 1898 – October 7, 1964), an economist with the United States War Production Board (WPB) during World War II, was the head of a large ring of Communist spies in the U.S. government. It is from him that the FBI Silvermaster File, documenting the Bureau's investigation into Communist penetration of the Federal government during the 1930s and 1940s, takes its name. His wife, Helen and stepson, Anatole Volkov, were members of his ring.

He was identified as a Soviet agent in the WPB operating under the code names Pel, Pal, ""Paul"" in the Venona decrypts; and as ""Robert"" both in Venona and independently by defecting Soviet intelligence courier Elizabeth Bentley.

Background

Silvermaster was born to a Jewish family in Odessa, Russia (present-day Odessa, Ukraine) in 1898. He moved with his family to China, where he learned to speak perfect English with a British accent. He emigrated to the United States and earned his B.A. from the University of Washington in Seattle (where he was ""stated to be a known Communist"") and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley, where his thesis was entitled Lenin's Economic Thought Prior to the October Revolution. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1926. He was reported to be in contact with a very large number of Communist Party USA officials, and was active in a number of Communist front groups.

Career

Civil service

From August 1935 to November 1938, Silvermaster worked in the Farm Security Administration.  From November 1938 to July 1940, he worked on the  Maritime Labor Board.  From July 1940 to December 1944, he worked in the Department of Agriculture.

While nominally remaining on the employment rolls of the Farm Security Administration, Silvermaster arranged in 1942 to be detailed to the Board of Economic Warfare. The transfer, however, triggered objections from military counter-intelligence who suspected he was a hidden Communist and regarded him as a security risk. On July 16, 1942 the U.S. Civil Service Commission recommended ""Cancel eligibilities ... and bar him for the duration of the National Emergency."" 

Silvermaster denied any Communist links and appealed to Under Secretary of War Robert Patterson to overrule the security officials. Both White House advisor Lauchlin Currie (identified in Venona as the Soviet agent operating under the cover name ""Page"") and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Harry Dexter White (identified in Venona as the Soviet agent operating under the cover names ""Lawyer""; ""Jurist""; ""Richard"") intervened on his behalf. Silvermaster subsequently received two promotions and pay raises.

From 1942 to 1945, he was also assigned to the United States Treasury.  In mid-1945, he joined the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (later War Assets Corporation).  In March 1946, he resigned from government.

On August 28, 1950, Lee Pressman (a member of the Ware Group, a precursor to the Silvermaster and Perlo) said of Silvermaster, ""I believe he was with the Maritime Labor Board when I was with the CIO, and in that connection I may have had some business dealings with him"" (apparently referring to Silvermasters time with that union 1938–1940).

Espionage: Silvermaster Group

Kathryn S. Olmsted, the author of Red Spy Queen (2002), points out: ""Every two weeks, Elizabeth would travel to Washington to pick up documents from the Silvermasters, collect their Party dues, and deliver Communist literature. Soon the flow of documents grew so large that Ullmann, an amateur photographer, set up a darkroom in their basement. Elizabeth usually collected at least two or three rolls of microfilmed secret documents, and one time received as many as forty. She would stuff all the film and documents into a knitting bag or other innocent feminine accessory, then take it back to New York on the train.""  Moscow complained that around half of the photographed documents received in the summer of 1944 were unreadable and suggested that Ullmann receive more training. However, Pavel Fitin, who was responsible for analyzing the material, described it as very important data.

At the War Production Board, Silvermaster was able to provide the Soviet Union with a large amount of data on arms, aircraft, and shipping production. In June 1943, Silvermaster sent a War Production Board report on arms production in the United States, including bombers, pursuit planes, tanks, propelled guns, howitzers, radar and submarines, sub chasers, and the like, to Soviet intelligence. Then, in December 1944, the New York MGB office cabled another Silvermaster report stating: ""(Silvermaster) has sent us a 50-page Top Secret War Production Board report ... on arms production in the U.S.""

In 1944, Silvermaster was associated with Harry Dexter White at the Bretton Woods conference, and his testimony before the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee covers ""175 pages of interrogation and exhibits"" regarding his espionage activities in the U.S. 

The Silvermaster spy ring operated primarily in the Department of the Treasury but also had contacts in the Army Air Force and in the White House. Sixty-one of the Venona cables concern the activities of the Silvermaster spy ring.  This represents 1% of the total (approx 6,000 cables) and 3% of the (2,000) translated/partially translated VENONA cables.

"Brutus (tragedy)

Brutus  is a tragedy in five acts by Voltaire. He began work on the play in 1727 in England and completed it in 1729. It premiered on 11 December 1730 in Paris.

Composition
The first part of the work was written in English at Wandsworth while Voltaire was in England, and it was completed on his return to France.  Two and a half years passed before he considered it ready for the stage. Voltaire's lover Adrienne Lecouvreur was meant to play the role of Tullie, but she fell ill and died during rehearsals and had to be replaced by Mlle Dangeville. She was only sixteen years old, and her nervousness did not help the reception of the play.

Action
Voltaire drew his material from the legendary story of the first Roman Consul Lucius Junius Brutus (509 BC). His son, Titus, falls in love with Tullie, daughter of the last Etruscan king of Rome, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, and through this relationship is led into betraying Rome.  The Senate hands Titus over to his father, who forgives him but insists on his execution to ensure the safety of the Republic.

Critical reception
When the play premiered at the Comédie-Française on December 11 1730, audience reaction was mixed.  It was criticised for not adhering to the three unities and for the harsh attitude of the character of Brutus. Although the play was well-attended, it was taken off the stage after only fifteen performances. The openly republican theme of the play displeased the authorities, and Voltaire's enemies Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon and the Chevalier de Rohan were actively trying to turn the public against it.  Voltaire left Paris to spend some time privately in Rouen. The play enjoyed a revival during the French Revolution, and the National Convention ordered a performance of Brutus on 2 August 1793 with free admission. in all there were 110 performances at the Comédie-Française between 1730 and 1799.

Printed editions
The first edition was printed in 1731 with Jean-François Josse in Paris, together with a Discours sur la Tragédie by Voltaire, dedicated to Lord Bolingbroke. Thirteen individual editions followed during Voltaire's life, and between 1790 and 1794 twelve further editions were added.

"Demand flow technology

Demand Flow Technology (DFT) is a strategy for defining and deploying business processes in a flow, driven in response to customer demand.  DFT is based on a set of applied mathematical tools that are used to connect processes in a flow and link it to daily changes in demand.
DFT represents a scientific approach to flow manufacturing for discrete production.  It is built on principles of demand pull where customer demand is the central signal to guide factory and office activity in the daily operation.  DFT is intended to provide an alternative to schedule-push manufacturing which primarily uses a sales plan and forecast to determine a production schedule.

History
It was created by John R. Costanza, an executive with operations management experience at Hewlett Packard and Johnson & Johnson.  Costanza, who was later nominated as a Nobel Laureate in Economics (True, he is on the nomination list as Nobel Laureat for Economics) for Working Capital Management, founded the John Costanza Institute of Technology in Englewood, CO in 1984 to provide consulting and education services for manufacturers to implement the methodology.

DFT uses applied mathematical methods to link raw and in-process materials with units of time and production resources in order to create a continuous flow in the factory.  The objective is to link factory processes together in a flow and drive it to customer demand instead of to an internal forecast that is inherently inaccurate.

Early adopters of DFT included American Standard Companies General Electric  and John Deere (Deere & Company).

In the early years, DFT was regarded as a method for ""just-in-time"" (JIT), which advocated manufacturing processes driven to actual customer demand via Kanban.  It was introduced as a way for American manufacturers to adopt Japanese production techniques, such as Toyota Production System (TPS), whilst avoiding some of the cultural conflicts in applying Japanese business methods in an American company.  Later, it has come to be seen as a lean manufacturing method that allows factories to implement techniques such as one-piece flow, TAKT-based line design, Kanban material management and demand-driven production.

Demand Flow Technology is promoted as a method for any product, any day, any volume.  In 2001, Costanza was awarded a patent for this approach for mixed-model manufacturing.

Principles

Demand-driven manufacturing

The central tenet to DFT is the primacy of customer demand in daily execution of the operation.  According to Aberdeen Group,

""Demand driven manufacturing involves a synchronized, closed loop between customer orders, production scheduling, and manufacturing execution; all while simultaneously coordinating the flow of materials across the supply chain."" [Aberdeen Group, 2007].

DFT is a pathway to achieve demand-driven manufacturing capability.  It is used as a framework to guide the design, implementation and deployment of demand driven manufacturing in a repeatable form.  In this way, it is similar original concept of Just-in-Time (JIT) that was first deployed in Japanese manufacturers using a foundation of total quality management.  More recently, Just-in-time has been more commonly used to describe supplier delivery methods, rather than a production philosophy.  DFT assumes basic process capability that can arise from TQM and statistical process control (SPC) principles and embeds it in a framework of management that can more easily achieve demand driven in a repeatable way.

As a result, In-Progress and Finished inventories are all but eliminated, converted permanently into cash at full market value through much faster response to customer orders.

Cash released from Working Capital in this way no longer has to be reinvested in inventory. It becomes available to retire debt, fund growth and innovation.

Mixed-model production

Mixed-model production is the production of a wide range of product models using a certain degree of shared resources and common material.  It is commonly accepted that modern manufacturing places a greater pressure on producers for more choice in the product offering. Products are increasingly assembled from standard components and sub-assemblies, using machines and automated systems as well as manual labour.  DFT is designed to handle this mix and provide a way to establish mixed-model production lines.

A production schedule based on MRP will tend to cope with high product mix by allocating each model to a multiple of a shift or a day.  This means that the whole product mix is supplied across a scheduling cycle of a multiple of weeks.  This tends to extend the lead-time or increase dependency on the forecast.  DFT offers “The ability to accommodate a range of volumes for any product, any day, based on the direction of actual customer demand”.

Product synchronization

The first tool to be used in a DFT implementation, product synchronization is a definition of relationship of processes in a flow to build a product.  It takes the form of a diagram, usually created in pen and paper or whiteboard and formalized with a visualization program such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Visio.  It displays how the processes relate to each other in a flow, with the conversion of raw material to finished goods.  A process is defined by ""A logical grouping of value-adding work performed to a common volume"".

Sequence of events (SoE)

Each of the processes in the product synchronization requires a standard process definition.  In DFT, the sequence of events provides this definition.  In The Quantum Leap, written by Costanza, the sequence of events is defined as ""[t]he definition of the required work and quality criteria to build a product in a specific production process.""
The SoE usually takes the form of a table with the product code, process ID, task description and sequence, required work and set-up time for machines and labour, and quality check criteria.  The SoE intends to define times that are reasonable, realistic and repeatable to perform to the necessary quality.  Many of the strengths and criticisms of DFT as a methodology stem from the SoE.  The SoEs are the foundation of process definition but are not used as work instructions.  To communicate standard work at the work center, operation method sheets are used.
In an MRP systems environment, the SoE represents a drill-down from the routing that provides a tabular view of the Product Synchronization at the process level.  A DFT manufacturer would therefore use the SoE as the master record of process definition and derive routings and ISO documentation from it.

Operation method sheets

These are visual description of work in motion, materials and the required quality check.  In the purest form, operation method sheets are drawn in wire-frame to show the significant contours of the product form and clearly represent work in motion and quality without visual noise.  The OMS has three stages of activity: total quality check, work, and verify.  This establishes the concept where each operator checks the output quality of the operation immediately upstream.  This can contribute to a total quality culture and parts-per-million capability.

Mixed-model process map

The sequence of events and product synchronization define how tasks and quality check compose the process for any given product.  The mixed-model process map shows how products and processes form a requirement for resources.  In such a map, the products and processes form a matrix with products as rows and processes as columns.  At the intersection are most commonly actual times (standard times at the process from the sequence of events), but could also display yield and optionality ratios.

Demand at capacity

Demand at capacity is the volume of production for a single product item at capacity.  It is a fixed value that defines the maximum daily rate of supply.  The Demand-at-Capacity is often confused with the daily rate of production.  In contrast to Toyota Production System, and many other lean manufacturing derivatives, a DFT line is designed for variable output rates according to daily demand.  Thus, the demand data that are used for line design represent a limit quantity not an actual rate of supply.  The relationship between the Dc and the average daily demand will be driven by the required service level of the product item to market demand.  A higher service level will call for capacity that can supply a higher daily rate than the average over a long range.  This will likely affect the resource productivity and inventory levels.  A greater mix on the line is able to provide a higher level of service for any given level of resources and inventory.

Effective hours

The effective hours is the time available for a given resource to produce product or perform process set-up or changeover.  It is defined per shift and represents the total available time to perform tasks set in the SoE.  Non-productive time such as equipment maintenance, breaks, 5S activity and continuous improvement is deducted from effective hours.  Setup time is included as it is arguably a form of productive time and calculations for batch size optimization and dynamic Kanban will require setup and run-time to be managed from a common pool of resource time.

Takt & Operational Cycle-Time, OP c/t

Takt-time is the ratio of time to volume at capacity and in DFT is expressed as

Where HE is Effective Hours, S is the number of shifts and DC is the demand at capacity, a daily rate set for design purposes at some point 2 to 5 years into the future.  This ratio can be expressed for finished products at the end of the line and is referred to as Takt-Time.  It can also apply at the process where bill of material relationships, process yield and optionality can affect the dependent volume for any given Dc at the finished goods level.  At the process level, this ratio is known as operational cycle-time.

Takt time is typically used to calculate the ""line design"" or number and disposition of physical resources required to produce a given mix and volume of products that changes on a daily basis according to customer demand.

Uniquely to DFT Takt time is constant, based on a fixed mix and product volume which is set for factory design purposes 2 to 5 years into the future. This allows for a stable ""line design"" that does not need to change on a daily basis. Daily changes in mix and volume are accommodated in DFT by adjusting the number of people working in production. Those not required to meet the Daily Rate (Dr) are free to spend quality time in training and continuous improvement activities.

Weekly scheduling cycles to achieve level-loading of mix and volume, which cause significant planning delays, are eliminated. It becomes possible to produce any product on any day in response to real customer demand making possible a true Demand Flow.

As a result, In-Progress and Finished inventories are all but eliminated, converted permanently into cash at full market value through much faster response to customer orders.

Cash released from Working Capital in this way no longer has to be reinvested in inventory. It becomes available to retire debt, fund growth and innovation etc.

Material Kanban

DFT shares a conventional definition of material Kanban based on a visual signal to replenish a point of consumption with required material.  A typical material Kanban system in DFT is ""Single Card, Multiple Container"" and enables card or container quantities to be consumed and replenished without shortages.

Material Kanban provides an alternative to kitting as a way of issuing material to the production floor.  A DFT environment will strive to simplify the definition of warehouse locations for material and reduce the number of transactions required to control the flow of material during production.  The aim of Material Kanban is to connect the material flow with actual requirement at the process and provide a more robust availability of parts to production whilst reducing the response-time to the customer.

Production Kanban

Production Kanban is designed for a replenishment quantity that may be smaller than a lot size or batch.  It is based on a ""dual card Kanban"" system where a ""move"" card or container represents the quantity required by the downstream point of consumption and a ""produce"" card is kept on a display board and accumulates to a replenishment batch.

Demand-based management

Demand-based management is an approach that defines tolerance capability for demand in order to unify material and production planning under conditions of demand uncertainty.  It uses ""flex fences"" to set the upper and lower boundaries of supply against a definition of the current daily rate of demand.  The current rate is usually some kind of smoothed average and will move over time.  The flex-fences will be different for different product items or groups and should be calculated individually.  Order policies, purchasing, inventory and production capacity will all be set against these flex fence boundaries, so these calculations will sit at the heart of operations planning.

Unfortunately, this is a calculation-intensive and critical process that is largely unsupported by MRP/ERP systems.  The lack of system tools and clash with conventional MRP planning routine are primary reason why demand-based management has not had the same level of adoption experienced by the rest of the DFT principles.

Value and results

Companies that implement DFT are typically looking for an improvement in the response to customer demand.  This is reflected in the lead-time or replenishment time for finished product and will affect the level of inventory that is held to buffer response requirements.
Effective response to demand can be described as a distribution curve, with some orders taking longer to fill than others.  The result is variation and uncertainty in the manufacturer’s ability to serve the market.  Working capital is required to hedge this response lag and uncertainty.

DFT aims to reduce both the variation and duration of response to demand.  This can be seen as a more capable fulfillment that provides a higher level of customer service at a lower level of working capital.  The intended results are improvement in delivery performance together with increased cash-flow and return on working capital.

Applications

Demand flow technology is applicable in a wide range of product environments and has been successfully deployed in many different industries.  Companies who have embraced demand flow technology include John Deere, , Flextronics, American Standard Companies, Trane, AstraZeneca and many others.  It has a strength in those manufacturing operations that are expected to supply a high mix to an unpredictable and volatile market.  It is often seen as the science behind flow manufacturing for discrete manufacturers, whose products do not naturally flow across the manufacturing processes.

Advantages and criticisms

Advantages

It is simple
Demand flow technology provides a simple, logical method based on applied mathematics.  The technique is based on simple operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division so it does not rely on advanced mathematics.

It is repeatable
DFT forms a step-by-step guide to converting production from a scheduled-push to a demand-pull and flow system.  Although it is applicable to a wide range of products, the steps are consistent and work in the same way.  It does not depend on the judgment of an expert in the same way as lean or Six Sigma and can be taught to a broader audience through short training workshops.

It is effective
At its heart, DFT formalizes the natural flow of material, processes and information required to build a product.  It is not so much an invented technology as a description of the optimal way to align a factory towards customer demand.

It is customer-centric
DFT places the customer at the center of the operation.  It enables companies to formalise a customer-centric view with practical tasks and actions that guide behaviour in the organisation.  It moves the concept of customer-driven to an achievable plan of action beyond a statement of philosophy.

It aligns business and customer goals
The concept of maximizing shareholder value is often seen as a conflict with the quality of customer service.  Demand Flow Technology, if applied correctly, can unify financial and customer objectives in a holistic approach to managing operating capital and growing a business.

Criticisms

It is constrained to the factory
Demand flow techniques have been widely applied to the factory, yet have failed to gain widespread acceptance in corporate management.  All too often, it tends to be limited to production planning whilst operations and material planning continue to be dominated by use of ERP/MRP systems.  The holistic ideal of demand flow may be fractured by this conflict.

It is unsupported by systems
Major ERP/MRP vendors have largely ignored the advantages of Demand Flow techniques, or been acquired before their products have had a chance to gain market share.  The advocates and users of Demand Flow have largely failed to challenge the inadequate logic that conventional MRP uses for planning capacity and production resources  As a result, manufacturers are forced to rely on an outdated routine for planning that is largely unchanged since the 1960s.

It requires process definition and discipline
DFT aims to apply a standard process definition of product to daily requirements of demand.  This favours processes that are capable and defined to the task level.  This is sometimes a level of detail and discipline absent from the organisation.  The creation and maintenance of Sequence of Events documentation involves extensive manual work.  There are powerful advantages to quality and capability in performing this work, but success usually depends on management commitment to change beyond the narrow actions of a DFT implementation.

"Miracle Wood Stakes

The Miracle Wood Stakes is an American Thoroughbred horse race held in February at Laurel Park Racecourse in Laurel, Maryland. The Miracle Wood is open to three-year-olds and is run at seven furlongs on the dirt. 

An ungraded stakes, it currently offers a purse of $100,000. The Miracle Wood is also one of Maryland's triple crown prep races. The winner of the race typically moves on to compete in the Private Terms Stakes held in March at Laurel Park Racecourse as well, but winners have also ventured to New York and Kentucky for their next races.

The race was named in honor of Miracle Wood, a champion Maryland bred colt that won many races and accolades. In 2008,the race was shortened from one mile to the current distance of seven furlongs. During the first eleven years of the race (1993–2003), it was run at a distance of  miles (8.5 furlongs).

In 2006, Sweetnorthernsaint set a record winning margin of ten lengths. He went on to win the Illinois Derby that year and was the post time favorite in the 132nd Kentucky Derby. A local horse based at Laurel Park Racecourse, Sweetnorthernsaint became a millionaire and placed second in the state's biggest race, the Preakness Stakes.

"Summer Heat Beach Volleyball

Summer Heat Beach Volleyball is a beach volleyball video game released by Acclaim in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 gaming console.

Gameplay
Summer Heat follows the basic rules of the sport of beach volleyball. Two teams of two players each face off in a sectioned-off area of sand that serves as the playing area. One player serves the ball, and play begins. The objective is to land the ball on the ground within the play area of the other team's side. Players alternate hitting (""volleying"") the ball, up to three volleys per turn, and the ball must travel over the net no later than the third hit. The game supports up to four players, though the use of a multitap accessory is required for three and four player games. Summer Heat is styled similarly to other arcade-style volleyball games of the era, where there is an emphasis on the sex appeal of the bikini-clad female characters as well as having the overall tone and atmosphere of a summer beach party.

Music
Summer Heat's soundtrack features music from Pink, Sum 41, Kylie Minogue, Sprung Monkey, Freshmaka, and Suburban.

Reception

The game was released during a period where volleyball video games were experiencing a period of renewed popularity for the first time in many years, although it received considerably less hype and critical praise than its contemporaries Beach Spikers, Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball, and Outlaw Volleyball.  It currently has a score of 68.09% on GameRankings and 65 out of 100 on Metacritic.

The game was one of several poor-selling titles that would lead to Acclaim's bankruptcy in 2004.

Future

In 2006, Canadian game publisher Throwback Entertainment acquired the property rights for Summer Heat Beach Volleyball from Acclaim. Throwback had planned on developing another Summer Heat volleyball game for release on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, but there is no word on the status of such a game. Summer Heat Volleyball is expected to keep its identity and will not be dissolved or merged.

"Luoyang Bridge

The Luoyang Bridge, also known as Wan'an Bridge, is located in Quanzhou, Fujian province, China. The stone bay bridge is situated at the mouth of Luoyang River. Being the first stone bay bridge in China, it enjoys the reputation of "" one of the four ancient bridges of China"".

The project started from the fifth year (1053) of Huangyou's ruling period in northern song dynasty. Cai xiang, the chief of Quanzhou prefercture in the 3rd year (1058) of Jiayou's reign, took over the task of constructing the bridge, who had overcome several difficulties concerning bridge deck pavement and bridge pier by applying a raft foundation and raising oysters in the river to solid the base. In the fourth year (1059) of Jiayou's reign, the construction of Luoyang bridge was completed and Caixiang wrote ""The Wan'an bridge"" for it. The bridge had been reconstructed and repaired in the later dynasties. In the southern song dynasty, pagodas and fengshui pagodas were built outside the guardrail of the bridge.

The bridge is 1200 meters long, and has 46 piers in total. The north part of the bridge is in the territory of Hui'an county while the south is in Luojiang district. The middle part is located in a river island called Zhongzhou. Pagodas and tower joss can be found both on the bridge and Zhongzhou island.

Luoyang bridge was listed as a key cultural relics unit under the national protection in 1988, and in 2009, it was selected as one of the cultural world heritage sites along the maritime silk road.

History 

Luoyang bridge, also known as Wan'an bridge, is named for being situated on the Luoyang river. Legend has it that in the Tang dynasty, emperor Xuanzong of Tang disguised himself and went to the street to inspect people's lives. He stopped by a river in north-west hui'an county, Quanzhou, and claimed the scenery by the river was somewhat similar to what he saw in Luoyang. Therefore, the river has been called Luoyang river ever since.

Before it was built, there was a ferry crossing called Wan'an to help locals cross the river. The ferry was in the estuary, and accidents frequently resulted from harsh winds and high seas, and crossings were impossible for several days. During the reign of Qingli in northern song dynasty, one of the Quanzhou locals, Lichong, used stones as piers and wood as deck to build a floating bridge to help passersby cross the river; however, it was destroyed by water more than once. In the fifth year (1053) of Huangyou's reign, another Quanzhou local, Wangshi, capped and fixed the floating bridge, which was the starting point of constructing Luoyang bridge officially. During the construction, they encountered many problems including the lack of funds, the extreme difficulty of building seven of the bridge piers and the deck.

In the July of the 3rd year (1058) of Jiayou's reign, Caixiang was appointed as the chief of the Quanzhou prefecture, and then he actively participated in the construction of the bridge. He called on donation, cultured oysters to fix the piers, and took advantage of the ebb and flow to successfully build the deck. In the December of the 4th year (1059) of Jiayou's reign, the construction was completed, and Caixiang wrote ""The Wan'an bridge"" to memorialize it. Luoyang bridge became the first bay bridge in Chinese history. From the northern song dynasty to contemporary times, eight pagodas and fengshui towers have been built around Luoyang bridge.

According to records, Luoyang bridge had been repaired and maintained 17 times from its completion to 1993, among which the one made in the 8th year (1138) of Shaoxing's reign in southern song dynasty was the first. In the 6th year (1408) of Yongle in Ming dynasty and the 4th year (1453) of Jingtai, the bridge went through reconstruction. In Jiajing's reign of Ming dynasty, barracks were built on the Zhongzhou island, the middle part of Luoyang bridge, to resist Japanese pirates.

The bridge survived unscathed a major earthquake in the 32nd year (1604) of Wanli in Ming dynasty.

During Chongzhen's reign, Japanese pirates almost disappeared, and a pavilion was built on the old barracks, which was named ""Jinghong pavilion"" (rainbow in the mirror).

In the 20th year of Qing emperor Kangxi's reign (1681), in the eighth year of Yongzheng's reign (1761) and the 23rd year of Daoguang (1843), the bridge was damaged and was repaired. In the 10th year of Xianfeng (1860), attempts were made to carry out further repairs. The 19th Route Army, who were garrisoned in the Quanzhou area, reinforced the main body of the bridge in 1932, fixing piers and using steel reinforced concrete for girders and decking.

During the Sino-Japanese war, this bridge was destroyed by the Japanese army. It was repaired in 1946, but during the second Chinese civil war, the national revolutionary army destroyed the bridge again. The cultural relics were all ruined, and the only thing left was the pier. Later, the People's Republic of China spared every efforts to repair the bridge. In 1961, it was listed as one of the cultural relics unit of Fujian province. In 1974, because of the serious damage of Luoyang bridge, it was no longer capable of serving as a transporting bridge, thus the highway bureau built a new highway bridge 700 meters away from the Luoyang bridge in the upstream. Luoyang bridge officially became the passage to connect the shores of Luo river, and also a heritage bridge. It became a cultural relics unit under national protection in 1988. In 1991, it was officially listed as a reconstruction project, which started in 1993 and completed in 1996. It was selected as one of the cultural world heritage along the maritime silkroad in 2009.

Structure

The structure of the main body 

Luoyang bridge, located in the mouth of Luo yang river in Quanzhou, Fujian province, is a stone bay bridge. It has north–south orientation, extending from the dyke made of stones, passing an island called ""Zhongzhou"" in the middle of the river, and entering Luojiang district in its south end. It is 731.29 meters in length. The south side bridge approach is 80.5 meters long, 7 meters wide. The north side bow bridge is 11 meters long, 7 meters wide, and the main deck is 5 meters wide. There are 47 apertures and 46 piers. Piers are built up by boulder strips. The boulder strips on the top two levels extend to both right side and left side in order to reduce the span of the slabstone. Cutwater can be found in the upstream of the pier bottom, whose sharp end is slightly cocking-up, a ""raft foundation"". The bridge plate is made of large-scale boulder strips. Back to the ancient time, the engineer took the advantage of ebbs to successfully build the plate. On both sides of the plate, there are 500 stone guardrails to protect passers-by from falling into the river.

Subsidiary buildings

The stone tower 

There are 7 stone towers outside the guardrails of the bridge, among which 3 are pagodas of multi-storied pavilion type, 1 Baoqie Sutra-printing house, 1 Five wheel tower, 1 Jing Zhuang, 1 Zheng feng tower (repress the wind), and 1 foundation base. From south to north, these 7 towers are:
 On the east side of the south end, there is a stupa style pagpda, which is 5 meters high, with a square foundation base, a round tower body. A niche door opens in its south side, and one relief sculpture of diamond guard can be found on both sides. A hexagon turret cover can be found on the guards, which has a 3-layer wheel and a Sarah on the top.
 On the west side of the north end, there is a 3-stored hexagon solid pagoda, which has a square foundation made of boulder strips and 2.6 meters long on each side of the foundation. The pedestal is equilateral hexagon. On each side of the first layer of the tower body, there is a Buddha sculpture; the six word mantra tantra on the second; and a carving letter of ""Fo"" (Buddha) on the east side, and ""Shi, Fang, San, Shi, Yiqie"" on other sides. Thatsa can be found on the top of the tower, below which there are covered bowl, wheel, and Sarah.
 On the south side of the atrium bridge in Zhengzhou island, there is a 3-meter high Zhenfeng tower, whose body is a cone shape with no sculpture on it. A monument said ""Zhenfeng tower on Luoyang bridge"" is on one side of the tower.
 On the northwest side of Zhongzhou island, a square Baoqie sutra-printing pagoda is built in the jointing place of the island and the bridge. The relief sculpture of mountains, rivers, plants and gods is on its foundation base. On 4 sides of the tower, there is a sculpture of the Buddha, whose shape and structure is almost the same as the ""Moonlight Buddha tower"" depicted in the following section.
 To the north of the Zhengzhou island, on the pier of the middle part of the bridge, there stands a Baoqie sutra-printing pagoda, which is 3.64 meters high and has a square base of 0.95 meters long on each side. The tower is 2-storied. On the first level, there is a sitting Buddha on 4 sides of the tower. The upper store is relatively high and far from the ground. In its direction of facing the river, a Buddha head is carved on the tower, and on the left and right sides of the head sculptured ""moonlight Buddha"" and ""built in the year of Jihai"". It is the only tower on Luoyang bridge which has the indication of the founding time and year. Archaeologists confirm that the tower was built in the 4th year (1059) of Jiayou in northern song dynasty according to its sculpturing style. A 1.6-meter high thatsa is above the tower, below which there are covered bowl, wheel, and Sarah.
 On the north end of the bridge, there are two 5-stored octagonal solid stone pagodas on each side of the bridge, with the same shape, structure and sculptures. They are around 6 meters high, and have a square base made of boulder strips. The foundation of the tower is equilateral octagonal shape, each of the turret cover is hexagon shape with the sculpture of bricks and hooks. On the due south, west, east and north side of each layer, there is a sitting Buddha relief sculpture. The Thatsa was built in later years, which is a cone shape and with no wheel.

Joss 

On the south end and the north end of Luoyang bridge, there are 2 stone joss protecting the bridge on each end. The joss is 1.63 meters high, facing each other, and they were all built during the northern song dynasty. Those sculptures all have Han nationality (the majority group of people in China), wearing hamlet and armor, holding long sword in hands.

Bridge pavilion 

There are two stone pavilions on Zhongzhou island. One is called ""Zhongting"" (the middle pavilion), a foursquare pavilion located in the north side of Zhongzhou island. The exact year of its building is unable to verify. The existing pavilion is, in fact, reconstructed on the basis of the body in the late Qing and early Ming dynasty, after the founding of the People's Republic of China. The other pavilion is called ""Xi chuan sweet rain pavilion"", built to commemorate the magistrate of Jinjiang county, Fang Ke, in Ming dynasty. Folklore has it that Fang's prayer for rain came true, then folks built this pavilion to commemorate him.

Memorial architecture 
A ancestral temple to commemorate Cai Zhonghui can be found 500 meters away from the south end of the bridge, which was built by descendants to remember Cai's contribution to build Luoyang bridge. This temple starts to build in northern song dynasty, and the existing one is in the construting style of Qing dynasty, which is oriented north and south and have 3 halls with 3 rooms. Zhaohui temple is built in the north side of the bridge, and the existing temple is also in Qing's style. It has 2 halls with 5 rooms. The exact year when the temple started to build is lost track, but archaeologists assume its predecessor is Zhenhai nunnery and then changed its name to Zhaohui temple. On the south end of the bridge, there are many sculptures made during the construction process, including the famous ""Wan'an bridge"", which has 153 letters on the 3-meter high and 1.5-meter wide stone monument. Besides, 26 monuments with carvings, which are from different periods of the bridge construction can be found in the north side of the bridge, Zhongzhou island and south side.

Conservation 

Food stalls and restaurants are everywhere on the bridge plate and on both sides of the bridge. Dinning-tables were put on the north and south side of the bridge back in 2005. In 2006, some people ignored the rule and made food stalls inside the pavilion which stands in the center of Luoyang bridge. The waste came from cooking might have damaged the stone bridge, thus municipal law enforcement department took action and changed the situation by removing the stalls. In 2010, some residents living in nearby villages tried to build a buddha temple without the government permission, which is forced to stop by government. Few months later, these residents tried again to build a stone buddha sculpture in the south end of the bridge, still with no permission of the government.

In 2008, severe deposition and piles of wastes in both river ways had affected the fishermen's life, and also raised the tension in terms of conservation of the bridge. Quanzhou municipal government planned to invest 7 million RMB to tackle this problem, improving the environment and clearing the river way. In 2015, a large number of mangrove had grown on the coastline and extended to the areas around Luoyang bridge. Then a debate went on to discuss whether the mangrove would have a bad impact on Luoyang bridge. The culture relics management office organized a team to cut down the 30 trees growing around the bridge. In November 2016, the plan of improving the environment around Luoyang bridge officially submitted to national culture relics bureau, and most parts of the plan got approval in December, expect the part for dredging.

"Artist Pension Trust

Artist Pension Trust (APT) is an investment vehicle specializing in contemporary art, which aims to provide financial security and international exposure to selected artists chosen by its international curatorial team. It has the largest global collection of contemporary art, comprising 10,000 artworks from 2,000 artists in 75 countries, and growing by more than 2,000 each year. As of November 2013, a total of 40,000 artworks had been committed to APT by 2,000 artists.  APT claimed its then value to be more than $US100 million.

Artworks from the APT collection have been used to curate exhibitions for museums including the MoMA, Tate Modern, Hirshhorn Museum, as well as for art venues such as the Venice Biennale, Art Basel, Documenta and Manifesta.

History

In 2004, a company named MutualArt launched the Artist Pension Trust as the first pension program for visual contemporary artists. It was founded by businessman Moti Shniberg, Hebrew University business professor, Dan Galai, and David A. Ross, former director of the Whitney Museum and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. APT started with eight regional trusts and subsequently launched a global trust, APT Global One, with a total of 628 artists. 

After the first year, Artist Pension Trust owned the collection of approximately 65 artworks created by artists in the New York branch, including Jules de Balincourt, William Cordova, Anthony Goicolea, and Aida Ruilova.

Storage Fee Changes
Artist Pension Trust announced that, beginning in September 2017, it would charge $6.50 per month for each work that members stored. The former CEO of the Mutual Art Group, which includes APT, defended the fee, arguing that the cost is much less than artists will have to pay elsewhere. He told Colin Gleadell of Artnet that “it’s not about raising money to balance our books; [it’s about getting] the work out of storage so that it can be seen and eventually sold. Some works have been in storage for ten years and that’s not good.” According to Brenner, the appeal of APT for some artists was the free storage facilities. In order to become a member, one originally had to agree to contribute to the storage expenses for oversize works when signing the contract, but the policy has never been enforced. In October 2017 seven former APT directors of the New York, London, Berlin, and Dubai Trusts and 21 APT officials— put their names on an open letter expressing solidarity with the aggrieved artists. The letter expresses “deep disappointment in the direction APT is moving,” saying that the policy changes deviate from the original vision of the Trust as they understood it.

Artwork distribution

The artworks in the trust are gradually sold over the course of 20 years for the benefit of the artists. The funds from the net proceeds of each artwork sold are distributed in the following manner: 72% are distributed to the artists in the trust, with 40% to the individual artist and 32% among the artists in that trust based on the number of artworks they have deposited. The remaining 28% is used to cover the operational costs of the trusts.

Exhibitions

In June 2013, Venice Biennale, a major contemporary art exhibition that takes place once every two years (in odd years) in Venice, Italy, included 26 artists who are also a part of the global Artist Pension Trust.

APT Institute

In July 2013, Artist Pension Trust announced establishment of APT Institute, a non-profit organization whose task is to facilitate exhibitions and loans for curators, museums, and art organizations, as well as to promote contemporary art and artists worldwide. Recent loans arranged through the APT Institute include Jean Shin’s installation of neckties and a chain link fence named ""Untied"", which featured in the solo show ""Jean Shin: Common Threads"", at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and Sherif El Azma’s ""Powerchord Skateboard"", a two-screen DVD installation that was part of the Tate Modern’s recent show ""Project Space: Objects in Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear"".

"Allahdad

The Allahdad () was an 1839 violent riot and forced conversion against the Jews of Mashhad, Khorasan,  Qajar Iran. After forced conversion of the Mashhadi Jews to Islam, many practiced Crypto-Judaism. The incident was important in the aspect that an entire community was forced to convert, and it was one of the first times European Jewry intervened on behalf of Iranian Jews.

The event was first described in Joseph Wolff's 1845 travelogue ""Narrative of a mission to Bokhara"", in which he wrote:
On Monday, the 11th of March, I arrived at Askerea, two miles distant from Meshed. I had sent on before the King's mehmoondar, and the gholam of the British embassy. The first who came to meet me was Mullah Mehdee (Meshiakh), the Jew with whom I had lodged twelve years ago, and who treated me most hospitably when in distress and misery and poverty, previous to the arrival of Abbas Mirza at Meshed, from Nishapoor.

All the Jews of Meshed, a hundred and fifty families, were compelled seven years ago, to turn Mussulmans. The occasion was as follows: A poor woman had a sore hand; a Mussulman physician advised her to kill a dog and put her hand in the blood of it; she did so; when suddenly the whole population rose, and said that they had done it in derision of their Prophet. Thirty-five Jews were killed in a few minutes; the rest, struck with terror, became Muhammedans ; and fanatic and covetous Muhammedans shouted, ""Light of Muhammed has fallen upon them!"" They are now more zealous Jews in secret than ever; but call themselves, like the Jews in Spain, Anusim, ""the compelled ones!"" Their children cannot suppress their feelings when their parents call them by their Muhammedan names! But Mullah Mehdee and Mullah Moshe believe in Christ, and Mullah Mehdee asked me to baptize him. He has been of the greatest use to the English in Heraut and Candahar, as his testimonials from Rawlinson and others amply testify.

In another narrative of the same event this incident happened during the Shia holy month on Muharram. The Shias were marching in the streets in memory of Hussein ibn Ali when the Jewish woman was throwing away the dog she killed for medical reasons. She was accused of deliberately offending the shi'is. 

Still another narrative reports that the dog was only a pretext and the conflict was because of earlier confrontations between a Sayyid (descendant of Muhammad) and the Jews who did not want to pay him for the Husainia he built near the Jewish commercial shops.  

In any case the recommendation by a Muslim physician seems unlikely as both Islamic and Jewish laws would consider dog's blood to be impure. 

Mashhad's ruler had ordered his men to enter Jewish homes and mobs attacked the Jewish community, burning down the synagogue, looting homes, abducting girls, and killing between 30 and 40 people. With knives held to their throats, the Jewish patriarchs were forced to vocally proclaim their ""allegiance"" to Islam as it was agreed upon by the leaders of the community that in order to save the remaining 2,400 Jews, everyone must convert. Most converted and stayed in Mashhad, taking on Muslim names, while some left for other Iranian Jewish communities and to Afghanistan. That day became known as the Allahdad (""God’s Justice"").

This event might also be understood in larger Jewish-Persian relations. Many Jews of Mashhad, including the chief of the local Jewish community, Mullah Mahdi Aqajan, served as British agents. This fact in addition to recent withdrawal of Iran from Herat in 1838 under British pressure, created an increasingly hostile atmosphere towards the Jews in Mashhad.  Few years after the incident with the intervention of Moses Montefiore the head of British Jewry at the time, Jews were allowed by Muhammad Shah's decree to return to Judaism. However most Jews fearing the anger of the local population decided to live outwardly as Muslims and living as crypto-Jews. 
On the outside, they acted as Muslims: their clothes, names, and lifestyles resembled those of their Iranian neighbors. At home, however, they secretly taught their children to read Hebrew, lit candles, and observed Shabbat.
Some Mashhadi Jews did not feel safe in Mashhad anymore and decided to move to other cities in the area such as Bukhara and Samarqand. A large group moved to Herat in present-day Afghanistan, where the majority of the Muslims were Sunni and more tolerant of the Jews than the Shiites.

Nearly a century passed before Mashad's Jews started practicing their faith openly with the coming of the more liberal Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979). After World War II, most of them settled in Tehran, Israel, or New York City, with 4,000 moving to the United States, where many ran successful jewelry and carpet businesses. The commercial district in Great Neck, New York, has been reshaped to serve the needs of Mashhadis and other Iranian Jews. Many businesses there cater to Iranian customs and taste. 

Worldwide there are 20,000 Mashhadis, of which about 10,000 live in Israel. Of the Mashhadis in the United States, many of them live in Great Neck, New York.

"Prinsesse Charlottes Gade

Prinsesse Charlottes Gade (lit. ""Princess Charlottes Street"") is a street in the Nørrebro district of Copenhagen, Denmark, linking Meinungsgade in the southeast with Jagtvej in the northwest.

Guldberg Byplads, a public space and playground, is located at the corner with Sjællandsgade.

History

The street was created in the 1850s. The new street was named after Princess Charlotte Frederica, the first wife of Christian VIII and the mother of Frederick VII. The street followed the east side of Svendsens Reberbane, a several hundred metres long ropewalk.

Notable buildings

Nørrebro Lilleskole (No. 34-36) is a self-owning primary school. The building is the former home of the Jewish Carolineskolen. It was built Copenhagen's Jewish boy's school which had until then been based in Skindergade. The school was merged with the city's Jewish girl's school under the name Carolineskolen  in 1945. It relocated to a former stockings factory on Bomhusvej in the Ryvangen Quarter of Østerbro in 1974.

KEA Prinsesse Charlottes Gade (No. 38) is a branch of KEA – Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. The building was constructed as a branch of the Technical Society's School. It was completed in 1900 from a design by Frederik Bøttger and Christian Larsen. It now houses KRA's construction & technology programmes as well as the student-run Monkey Bar.

The former Prinsesse Charlottes Gade School (No. 46) was one of the first primary schools in Nørrebro. It opened in 1875 as a branch of Sankt Hansgade School. The building was designed by Hans Jørgen Holm. The building is now operated as a daycare under the name Hulahophuset. The building on the other side of the street was built by Copenhagen Municipality in 1884 as stated in an inscription on the facade.

Public art, monuments and memorials

On the gable of the former Sjællandsgade School is a stone plaque commemorating the reunification of Sønderjylland with Denmark in 1920. The plaque features a symbolic relief of a woman approaching another woman seated on a klismos, both with their arms stretched out towards eachother as if they are about to embrace. Below the relief is an inscription: ""This stone was installed by the school's pupils in exhilaration over the reunification of Sønderjylland with Denmark 1920"".

"FuturePlay

The International Academic Conference on the Future of Game Design and Technology, also known as FuturePlay, is an international academic conference that focuses on the future of video game design and technology. The most recent conference under that title was held in 2010.

Overview
Future Play evolved from the former Computer Game Technology (CGT) Conference that had been initiated and run by Algoma University since 2002. The conference was held annually in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Future Play 2008 was hosted by Algoma and UOIT, each year bringing together key players from academics, industry, and government to advance game design and technology.

The conference focused on three themes: Future game development, future game impacts and application, future game talent. These issues were addressed through keynotes from leaders in academia and industry, peer-reviewed paper sessions, panel sessions, workshops, and exhibitions of posters, games, and the latest game technologies and supports from industry vendors.

Academic competitions

Games competition
The Future Play Game Exhibition and Competition allows academic, independent, experimental, and/or student developers to gain recognition for their game-related work in a juried competition. Developers can submit to the exhibition in the following categories:
 Future Games: this category is for games that experiment with new game technologies or design concepts.
 Future Game Impacts and Applications: this category is for games that are built not necessarily for pure entertainment purposes (i.e. serious games), such as games that are for learning purposes.
 Future Game Talent: this category is primarily for students who have built an original, entertainment game title who wish to show off their talents, earn publicity for their school, gain personal recognition, and perhaps even find a publisher for the game.
Games competition winners are generally recognized in the trade press.

Academic papers
Paper submissions for the conference were original, unpublished research. Papers often included late-breaking advances and work-in-progress reports from ongoing research. All submissions were peer-reviewed and evaluated based on originality, technical and/or research content/depth, correctness, relevance to conference, contributions and readability.

2008 program
Future Play 2008 was hosted by Algoma University and the University of Ontario Institute of Technology. It was hosted in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Speakers for the conference were Ken Perlin and Katie Salen. The theme of the conference was ""Research. Play. Share.""

"Pseudohalogen

The pseudohalogens are polyatomic analogues of halogens, whose chemistry, resembling that of the true halogens, allows them to substitute for halogens in several classes of chemical compounds. Pseudohalogens occur in pseudohalogen molecules, inorganic molecules of the general forms
Ps–Ps or Ps–X (where Ps is a pseudohalogen group), such as cyanogen; pseudohalide anions, such as cyanide ion; inorganic acids, such as hydrogen cyanide; as ligands in coordination complexes, such as ferricyanide; and as functional groups in organic molecules, such as the nitrile group.
Well-known pseudohalogen functional groups include cyanide, cyanate, thiocyanate, and azide.

Common pseudohalogens and their nomenclature
Many pseudohalogens are known by specialized common names according to where they occur in a compound. Well-known ones include (the true halogen chlorine is listed for comparison):

Examples of pseudohalogen molecules
Examples of symmetrical pseudohalogens (Ps–Ps) include cyanogen (CN)2,  thiocyanogen (SCN)2, selenorhodane (SeCN)2, azidodithiocarbonate (N3CS2)2. Another complex symmetrical pseudohalogen is dicobalt octacarbonyl, Co2(CO)8. This substance can be considered as a dimer of the hypothetical cobalt tetracarbonyl, Co(CO)4.

Examples of non-symmetrical pseudohalogens (Ps–X), analogous to the binary interhalogen compounds, are cyanogen halides (ICN, ClCN, BrCN), and other compounds. Sometimes nitrosyl chloride NOCl also is considered as pseudohalogen.

Not all combinations are known to be stable.

Pseudohalides
Pseudohalides are the univalent anions (or functional groups) which form hydracids with hydrogen and form insoluble salts with Ag(Silver) such as cyanides, cyanates, isocyanates, rhodanides (i.e. thiocyanates and isothiocyanates), selenocyanogens, tellurorhodanides and azides.

A common complex pseudohalide is tetracarbonylcobaltate (Co(CO)4−). The acid HCo(CO)4 is in fact quite a strong acid, though its low solubility renders it not as strong as the true hydrohalic acids.

The behavior and chemical properties of the above pseudohalides are identical to that of the true halide ions. The presence of the internal double bonds or triple bonds do not appear to affect their chemical behavior. For example, they can form strong acids of the type HX (compare HCl to HCo(CO)4), and they can react with metals to form compounds like MX (compare NaCl to NaN3).

Nanoclusters of aluminium (often referred to as superatoms) are sometimes considered to be pseudohalides since they, too, behave chemically as halide ions, forming Al13I2− (analogous to I3−) and similar compounds. This is due to the effects of metallic bonding on small scales.

"Passive electioneering

Passive electioneering is the act of wearing campaign paraphernalia or carrying signs to a polling place with the intent of influencing voters. Across the United States laws vary relating to passive electioneering. In the fall of 2008, officials in Virginia moved to ban the wearing of campaign paraphernalia. New York has a similar law in place.

In 2008, internet political organizers were cautioning voters not to wear campaign T-shirts at the polls. 

At least seven states, Maine, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Virginia, and Kansas prohibit wearing campaign buttons, stickers and badges inside polling places. Efforts to enforce a similar ban are headed to court in Pennsylvania. The American Civil Liberties Union argued that the ban violates the First Amendment's right to free speech.

United States

New York 

The State of New York has a rarely enforced law that prohibits wearing campaign buttons or T-shirt at a polling place. In the fall of 2008, New York State Board of Elections Spokesman Bob Brehm stated that voters at the polls who wear a campaign button or T-shirt will be asked to remove the item.

Virginia 

The Virginia State Board of Elections voted on Tuesday October 14, 2008, to ban clothing and hats as well as buttons and other paraphernalia that directly advocate the election or defeat of a specific candidate or issue.

Canada 

While Canadian electoral law allows representatives of the political parties to be present in polling stations, nobody present at the polling station is permitted to wear or carry anything identifying themselves as a member of a political party or supporter or opponent of any political cause . This includes voters . Partisan officials are also not permitted to campaign immediately in front of a polling station, nor may anyone bring any campaign literature into the station .

The equipment used by polling staff has to meet strict colour criteria. Staff may be refused work if their clothing is of a ""partisan colour""

United Kingdom

Wearing an explicitly party political item or bringing any political material into a polling station can be classed an attempt to intimidate voters. Clothing that is political but does not support or attack a party (for example, a Che Guevara t-shirt) may still be allowed.

He is generally credited as the first professional American boxer, due to his 1816 match with Tom Beasley, and has even been called ""The Father of The American Ring"".  One source notes that Hyer may have been born in Caernarvon Township in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and that his father Louis was employed as an iron maker at Windsor Forge in Churchtown, Pennsylvania as early as 1780.

Hyer v. Beasley

In October 1816 in Manhattan, Hyer (a butcher) fought Tom Beasley (an English mariner) in what is traditionally said to be the first professional American bout, in that it was open to the public and English boxing rules, specifically the Broughton rules, were observed. 

The fight has been described as a ""grudge match,"" because the two had previously been involved in a street fight, and decided to settle the matter in a more formal venue.

Apparently the rules of boxing were at least followed at the outset of the match, but degenerated as the fight progressed. Different reports of the official bout stated that Beasley broke Hyers' arm (and thus Beasley won), that the match ended in a draw (due to the broken arm), or that Hyer won the match.  Some modern sources state that Hyer won the match, though the basis for that conclusion is not stated.  Hyer never fought again after this one fight.

Historian Elliot J. Gorn, writing in the 1980s, states that although Hyer broke his arm, Beasley had been badly beaten, so after mutual friends intervened it was declared a draw. Gorn also states that the match was not actually the first ring fight in America, or the first open to the public, but that its ""significance lay in the perception that it was a historic event worth recording, in its being the earliest American fight kept alive as living memory of a heroic past. When men gathered at New York's Empire Club decades later, they recounted this battle time and again.... Hyer and Beasley were important because they were remembered as founding fathers.""

Legacy

Hyer was  and approximately 182 pounds. He was born in New York, or possibly Caernarvon Township in Pennsylvania's Lancaster County, and was of Dutch descent. In 1969, Hyer was elected to the Ring Magazine Boxing Hall of Fame.

Hyer's son, Tom Hyer, became the first American heavyweight boxing champion. The younger Hyer's famous victory against Yankee Sullivan in 1849 greatly spurred the popularity of the sport and served to preserve the legacy of his father's pioneering fight.

"Florence Hartmann

Florence Hartmann (born 17 February 1963) is a French journalist and author. During the 1990s she was a correspondent in the Balkans for the French newspaper Le Monde. In 1999 she published her first book, Milosevic, la diagonale du fou (Milosevic, the opposite of crazy), reissued by Gallimard in 2002. From October 2000 until October 2006 she was official spokesperson and Balkan adviser to Carla Del Ponte, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague.

On 19 July 2011, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY upheld the first instance decision to convict Hartmann of contempt of court for the section of text called ""Vital genocide documents concealed"" in her book, Paix et Châtiment, les guerres secrètes de la politique et de la justice internationales, which included the ""legal reasoning"" of two confidential appellate rulings of the UN Tribunal approving black-outs and exclusions from critical historical war documents showing Serbia's involvement in the Bosnian war of the 1990s. She was fined €7,000 (£6,100). The fine was later converted into a seven-day prison sentence, for which the ICTY issued an arrest warrant. In December 2011, France refused to extradite her.

Career
Hartmann worked for eleven years for the French daily Le Monde as a journalist in charge of the Balkan desk. From January 1990 until May 1994, she was Le Monde correspondent for the former Yugoslavia. In 1999 she published her first book, Milosevic, la diagonale du fou (later reissued by Gallimard in 2002). From October 2000 until October 2006, Hartmann was official spokesperson and Balkan adviser to Carla Del Ponte, chief prosecutor of the ICTY at The Hague. Her book, Paix et châtiment, Les guerres secrètes de la politique et de la justice internationales, regarding the politics of international justice and her version of how the ICTY and the ICTR functioned, was published by Parisian publisher Groupe Flammarion in September 2007.

In 2014, she published a book on whistleblowers, Lanceurs d'alerte, les mauvaises consciences de nos démocraties (published by Donquichotte Editions). In July 2015, she issued a book that reveals the role of the west in the runup to Srebrenica's fall, The Srebrenica Affair: The Blood of Realpolitik,

She was the first journalist to discover in October 1992 the existence and location of a mass grave at Ovčara (Croatia) containing the remains of 263 people who were taken from Vukovar's hospital to a nearby farm and killed on 20 November 1991 by Serb forces. On 25 May 2006, she gave evidence before the ICTY in the ""Vukovar massacre case"" against three Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officers -- Mile Mrkšić, Miroslav Radić and Veselin Šljivančanin—who had been indicted in relation to the Ovčara incident.

On 10 December 2011, Hartmann was given a lifetime achievement award for her contribution to the protection and promotion of human rights by the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights.

Contempt of Court in the ICTY
On 27 August 2008, Hartmann was indicted by the Tribunal for disclosing, in her book, Paix et châtiment, Les guerres secrètes de la politique et de la justice internationales, confidential information pertaining to two decisions of the Tribunal approving blackouts and exclusions from critical historical war documents provided by Belgrade for the trial of the former Serbian President Slobodan Milošević and showing Serbia's involvement in the Srebrenica massacre.

Hartmann posited that the ICTY Appeals Chamber had used invalid legal reasoning to effectively censor evidence which might have implicated Serbia-Montenegro in the alleged commission of genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the 1990s Balkans wars. She specifically criticized the ICTY Appeals Chamber for improperly denying victims of mass atrocities the ability to access information critical to their ability to obtain reparations for crimes committed against them and their relatives. She argued that the war documents censored by the ICTY should have been made available during a separate trial at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which Bosnia unsuccessfully tried to sue Serbia for genocide, because they could not prove a direct link between Belgrade and war crimes committed in Bosnia – most notably the massacre of up to 8,000 Bosniak men and boys around Srebrenica in 1995.

The Tribunal decision to grant confidentiality for the key portions of Belgrade war documents acknowledged that disclosure would harm Serbia's ""vital national interests"" by failing to protect Serbia from having to pay damages to Bosnia in Bosnia's suit then-pending at the ICJ.

The issue at trial was whether the information she disclosed – ""the existence and the purported effect"" of the two impugned confidential decisions of the ICTY Appeals Chamber’s dated 20 September 2005 and 6 April 2006 – was confidential or whether only the key evidence Serbia sought to censor was protected by a Court order.

On 14 September 2009, the ICTY found Hartmann guilty of contempt of court and was sentenced to pay a €7,000 (£6,100) fine for disclosing information relating to the two confidential ICTY Court orders that deprive victims and public from access to documents on Serbia's involvement in planning and executing the Srebrenica genocide in 1995. While the Chamber found that ""some protected information disclosed by the Accused in her publications was indeed in the public domain"", it considered that she disclosed ""more information, notably the legal reasoning applied by the Appeals Chamber in reaching its dispositions, as well as the purported effects of both Appeals Chamber decisions"".

She was convicted on these grounds of violating two appellate orders dated 20 September 2005 and 6 April 2006 issued in the Slobodan Milosević case before the ICTY.
 
On 24 September 2009, Hartmann launched an appeal against the conviction. The London-based international NGO called Article 19, which is dedicated to the protection and promotion of freedom of speech submitted an amicus curiae brief, calling the ICTY Appeals Chamber to apply the international standards allegedly disregarded by the Trial Chamber.

On 19 July 2011, the ICTY Appeals  Chamber dismissed all the grounds of  appeal advanced by  Hartmann and confirmed the conviction, limiting it exclusively to the ""disclosure of the legal reasoning of the two impugned confidential decisions"". The imposition of the €7,000 fine was upheld.

In March 2011, prior to the issuing of the appeal judgement against Hartmann, the impugned confidential decisions criticized by Hartmann were turned down.  Most of the critical documents provided by Belgrade for the trial of Slobodan Milosević in relation to which confidentiality orders had initially been made were released by the ICTY and admitted as public evidence  in the ICTY case against Momčilo Perišić, former Yugoslav Army chief of staff. The only information pertaining to the 2005 and 2006 confidentiality Court orders that still remains protected is therefore the Appeals Chamber’s legal reasoning. However, no ban was ordered in the ICTY Appeal judgment in relation to the three impugned  pages of her book or her articles.

In reaction to Hartmann's conviction by the ICTY, several international NGOs have criticized the ICTY for hiding its ""legal reasoning"" while the publicity of criminal proceedings is a general principle of criminal and international law which aim is to guarantee the transparency and public control of judicial proceedings. Reporters Without Borders and Article 19 condemned a conviction contravening international case law relating to freedom of expression.

Reporters Without Borders stated that ""it is the duty of the press to highlight how this internationally created system of justice works, to question its procedures and to stimulate public discussion"". ""Article 19 believes that such an insistence on keeping the logic and effect of the ICTY's jurisprudence secret is profoundly undemocratic and manifestly inappropriate for an international criminal court"", adding that ""[t]o impose such a penalty on a journalist for bringing transparency and accountability to the ICTY raises troubling questions about the Tribunal's democratic legitimacy"".

The €7,000 fine was deposited by Hartmann into a French dedicated bank account along with an invitation to the ICTY to seek assistance to the French authorities in order to collect these funds for the purposes of paying the fine. The ICTY Appeals Chamber deemed the money not to have been paid and converted, on 16 November 2011, the €7,000 fine into a seven-day prison term. An arrest warrant for contempt of court was issued by the ICTY on the same day, ordering France to transfer immediately Hartmann to The Hague and the Netherlands to assist in taking her to the United Nations detention unit. The French government refused to extradite Hartmann and informed the ICTY of this refusal on 27 December 2011.

In November 2011, Reporters Without Borders urged the French judiciary to determine the validity of the arrest warrant and to consider the merits of the case in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. ""The European Court of Human Rights has consistently emphasized the public interest in the reporting of legal issues. It would be illogical and dangerous if international justice was exempt.""

On 30 November 2011, Article 19 denounced the unlawfulness of the arrest warrant and ""calls on all states, particularly the French and Dutch authorities, to avoid complicity in this perversion of international justice and to resist carrying out the order"". Article 19 insisted that the human rights guarantees enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) should take priority over the ICTY and recalled that under the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, French authorities as well as the authorities of the 46 other member states to the European Convention are obliged to verify the legality of the ICTY orders which they are asked to execute.

Hartmann began petitioning Frank La Rue, United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Opinion and Expression, and Dunja Mijatović, the Representative for Freedom of the Media of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), on 30 November. As there is no appeal before an independent jurisdiction from a decision of the ICTY, Hartmann is seeking from the Special Rapporteurs a judgement that the ICTY decision against her violates international standards of protection of the right of freedom of expression and that upholding or executing the arrest warrant against her would constitute a further violation of this right. Reporters Without Borders called on both rapporteurs to remind international courts that they are subject to international norms, especially those concerning freedom of expression, noting that ""[b]eyond the Hartmann case itself, the decision to penalize criticism of an international tribunal is a dangerous precedent for all those working in the media.""

On 24 March 2016, Hartmann was arrested by UN guards as she gave an interview near the war crimes tribunal building. She was granted early release on 29 March 2016.

The Srebrenica Affair
The book L'affaire Srebrenica: Le Sang De La Realpolitik (The Srebrenica Affair: The Blood of Realpolitik) by Hartmann, was published by Éditions Don Quichotte, Paris, on 7 July 2015."" The book is an analysis of events leading to the fall of Srebrenica.

"DLEU1

In molecular biology, deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (non-protein coding), also known as DLEU1, is a long non-coding RNA. In humans it is located on chromosome 13q14. The DLEU1 gene was originally identified as a potential tumour suppressor gene and is often deleted in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It was later discovered to be a long non-coding RNA with over 20 different splice variants.

"Xin Hua (software)

Xin Hua () is a Mandarin speaking Vocal for Vocaloid 3 made for Taiwan.  She was  developed by the Yamaha Corporation and distributed by Facio, in collaboration with Gynoid Co., Ltd.

Development
Xin Hua was introduced through a webpage on January 16, 2015. The page contained information about her age, voice provider, and product information.  She was released on February 10 and was first distributed through TICA, along with other goods and merchandise.

She was mostly aimed at the Taiwan market and was very difficult, but not impossible, to get outside of Taiwan.  Despite this, she was quite popular and in April 2015, her physical packages that were put out for sale at the NicoNico Choukaigi event were completely sold out.

It later explained that her name derived from ""桃之夭夭，灼灼其華"", a line from the classic poem Tao Yao which translates to ""The peach tree is young and elegant, brilliant are its flowers"". Gynoid thought that a peach tree or blossom suited her cute concept and better represented the youth of a sixteen year old high school girl, thus she was given the name ""Xin Hua"". It was noted that they wanted the name to also fit the phrase, ""最美的風景是人心"", meaning ""The most beautiful scenery in Taiwan is the heart of Taiwanese people"". This is due to Taiwan being famous for its hospitality.

Characteristics
She wears a Taiwanese school uniform and has a pet bear called ""Xiao Hua (小花 Xiǎo Huā) "".

"Terrence W. Wilcutt

Terrence Wade Wilcutt (born October 31, 1949) is a United States Marine Corps officer and a NASA astronaut. He is a veteran of four Space Shuttle missions. Wilcutt is currently the Director of Safety and Mission Assurance, Johnson Space Center.

Personal
Born October 31, 1949, in Russellville, Kentucky, but raised in Louisville, Kentucky, Wilcutt graduated from Southern High School in 1967; and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics in 1974 from Western Kentucky University where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He then taught high school math for two years before entering the United States Marine Corps.

He was commissioned in 1976 and earned his aviator wings in 1978. Following initial F-4 Phantom training with squadron VMFAT-101, he reported to VMFA-235 at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. While assigned to VMFA-235, Wilcutt attended the U.S. Navy Fighter Weapons School (""TOPGUN""), and made two overseas deployments to Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. In 1983 he was selected for F/A-18 conversion training, and served as an F/A-18 Fighter Weapons and Air Combat Maneuvering Instructor with VFA-125, Naval Air Station Lemoore, California. In 1986, Wilcutt was selected to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Following graduation, he was assigned as a test pilot/project officer for Strike Aircraft Test Directorate (SATD) at the Naval Air Test Center, NAS Patuxent River, Maryland. While assigned to SATD, Wilcutt flew the F/A-18 Hornet, the A-7 Corsair II, the F-4 Phantom, and various other aircraft while serving in a wide variety of projects and classified programs.

He has over 6,600 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft.

NASA career
Wilcutt was selected as an astronaut candidate in 1990; he piloted missions STS-68 (1994) and STS-79 (1996). Wilcutt commanded mission STS-89 (1998) to the Mir space station and STS-106 (2000) to the International Space Station.

Spaceflight experience
STS-68 Endeavour (September 30 to October 11, 1994) was part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. STS-68, Space Radar Lab-2 (SRL-2), was the second flight of three advanced radars called SIR-C/X-SAR (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon-monoxide pollution sensor, MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites). SIR-C/X-SAR and MAPS operated together in Endeavour's cargo bay to study Earth's surface and atmosphere, creating radar images of Earth's surface environment and mapping global production and transport of carbon monoxide pollution. Real-time crew observations of environmental conditions, along with over 14,000 photographs, aided the science team in interpreting the SRL data. The SRL-2 mission was a highly successful test of technology intended for long-term environmental and geological monitoring of planet Earth. STS-68 launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California. Mission duration was 11 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes, traveling 4.7 million miles in 183 orbits of the Earth.

STS-79 Atlantis (September 16–26, 1996), the fourth in the joint American-Russian Shuttle-Mir series of missions, launched from and returned to land at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. STS-79 rendezvoused with the Russian Mir space station and ferried supplies, personnel, and scientific equipment to this base 240 miles above the Earth. The crew transferred over 3.5 tons of supplies to and from the Mir and exchanged U.S. astronauts on Mir for the first time – leaving John Blaha and bringing Shannon Lucid home after her record six months stay aboard Mir. Mission duration was 10 days, 3 hours, 18 minutes, traveling 3.9 million miles in 159 orbits of the Earth.

STS-89 Endeavour (January 22–31, 1998), was the eighth Shuttle-Mir docking mission during which the crew transferred more than 9,000 pounds of scientific equipment, logistical hardware and water from Space Shuttle Endeavour to Mir. In the fifth and last exchange of a U.S. astronaut, STS-89 delivered Andy Thomas to Mir and returned with David Wolf. Mission duration was 8 days, 19 hours and 47 seconds, traveling 3.6 million miles in 138 orbits of the Earth.

STS-106 Atlantis (September 8–20, 2000) was a 12-day mission during which the crew successfully prepared the International Space Station for the arrival of the first permanent crew. The five astronauts and two cosmonauts delivered more than 6,600 pounds of supplies and installed batteries, power converters, life support, and exercise equipment on the Space Station. Two crew members performed a space walk in order to connect power, data and communications cables to the newly arrived Zvezda Service Module and the Space Station. STS-106 orbited the Earth 185 times, and covered 4.9 million miles in 11 days, 19 hours, and 10 minutes.

"Isaac Abendana

Isaac Abendana (ca. 1640 – 1699) was the younger brother of Jacob Abendana, and became hakam of the Spanish Portuguese Synagogue in London after his brother died. 

Abendana moved to England before his brother, in 1662, and taught Hebrew at Cambridge University. He completed an unpublished Latin translation of the Mishnah for the university in 1671. 

While he was at Cambridge, Abendana sold Hebrew books to the Bodleian Library of Oxford, and in 1689 he took a teaching position in Magdalen College. In Oxford, he wrote a series of Jewish almanacs for Christians, which he later collected and compiled as the Discourses on the Ecclesiastical and Civil Polity of the Jews (1706). Like his brother, he maintained an extensive correspondence with leading Christian scholars of his time, most notably with the philosopher Ralph Cudworth, master of Christ's College, Cambridge.

When they pull out knives to defend themselves, the stranger attacks them, throwing the woman through the apartment door when the police officers arrive. The officer stare inside as they watch the stranger make short work of the two men. One, he sends through the apartment wall. When the officers fires on him he crashes through the apartment window and falls to the ground.

When the officers go down to see the body, They're startled to see the stranger quickly rise up screaming and they fire their guns, apparently, killing him. It's then when one officer asks to check under the Stranger's jacket to see if the stranger had large, ""S"" under it remarking, ""I think we just killed 'Clark Kent.'""

Later, the stranger's body is taken to the medical examiner. At the same time, a man, (Robert Forster), monitoring the police, hears of the spacecraft crashing and a possible suspect killed and sent to the Morgue, and rushes out of his seedy apartment with a .44 Magnum revolver in hand.

The Stranger's body is about to be examined by Asst. Medical Examiner Dori Caisson, (Hilary Shepard), when she sees that the bullet holes on his body start to glow and his skin miraculously heal. Still staring, she's horrified to see the stranger rise from the autopsy table and seize her. As they leave, they're stopped by the security guard, Moses, (Wally Taylor), who is attacked by the stranger and is rendered unconscious. The stranger forces Dori out to the roof parking lot and into her car. It's then that the man from the apartment rushes up and aims his gun at the stranger who yells out the man's name (which sounds like ""Yates"", which is the man's name in the Alien's language). With Yates firing his gun at him, the stranger, who's at the steering wheel, drives forward, and abruptly starts into reverse, at high speed, toward Yates knocking him over the side of the building where he lands into a tree, severely injured. Yates runs off where he brakes into a closed library and he begins to heal in the same manner as the stranger.

At the Examiner's Office the guard is questioned by Detective Sergeant Frank Ramos (Robert Davi),  with the Chief Medical Examiner, ""Doc"", (Bert Remsen)  present. He explains that Dori was kidnapped by one of the ""corpses"" who attacked him and fled with her. Ramos does not believe Moses, but Doc tells him that the body of the stranger, who was killed by the police officers, is missing.

Dori and the stranger end up at her home where he forces her into a chair and turns on her TV and radio to listening to all the programs. When Dori attempts to call the Police, thinking the Stranger distracted, he catches her and ties her up with the telephone cord and later they fall asleep. the next day Dori awakes to find the stranger wearing her late husband clothes. When she ask why he's wearing them she was surprised to find the stranger say ""Forgive me, I was cold.""

Saying that she did not believe that he understood her, he remarked that he could not until he had listened to all the TV programs. Dori remarked that he was not from around here to which he said ""No. I'm from another planet"". Still shocked after thinking he was dead, the stranger wondered why Dori thought he was dead because he had not begun to decompose. Dori stated that his injuries where fatal to humans. The stranger explained that his kind regenerate their major organs and die only after they suffer massive damage to their brain. When the stranger inquired as to humans, Dori wryly says, ""No, we just go to work for the Department of Motor Vehicles"". Baffled by the joke because his kind do not joke nor understand them, Dori tricks the stranger and escapes only to be caught at her car with her behind the steering wheel. Attempting to flee, she threaten to run him over. The stranger stops her by putting his foot on her car's bumper as she tries running him down.

Dori pleaded with him to let her go. The Stranger stated that he needed her to get his clothing for his crashed ship to lift off because the control card was in them and that he must return to his world because he is a ""Peacemaker"". ""A policeman"". Surprised and upset, Dori asked his name. He said ""Townsend"". Looking a little disappointed Dori said, ""I thought your name would be Darth Vader or something"".

Meanwhile, Yates is caught by the police, that day, in the Library and handcuffed. He then shears off his hand that was cuffed and escapes. Going to a phone booth, Yates finds Dori's address. Dori and Townsend, finding that the police was looking for them and that they could not get to the control card return to Dori's home to find Yates waiting and he attacks them. Knocking out Dori and damaging her home, Yates flees, with Townsend chasing him. Yates steals a pickup truck. With Townsend in the back of the truck they fight over control of it. Dori is discovered by Ramos at her home and is notified that Townsend and Yates were seen and that police cruisers was dispatched to stop them. After crashing through roadblocks and high-speed police chases, the truck swerves and explodes into flames.

Later that day, Ramos questions Dori at the police station about the attack on her and why Townsend, apparently not dead, kidnapped her. She said that she could not say positively why he was not dead but that both Yates and Townsend were possibly high on and drugs and that fooled her and cause the attack. Ramos, not believing but having no other explanation, lets Dori go.

Dori goes to her destroyed home only be captured by Yates who takes her to a deserted location. With wounds, Yates tells Dori that he is a Peacemaker and that Townsend was sent to kill someone who was in his world's Witness Protection. As Yates regenerates he tells Dori that when he joked with her, he could because he had lived on Earth for over 20 years and that if Townsend had a black card with him he needed it because it had the identity of Townsend's victim. Dori, somewhat believing, returns to her home only to be captured by Townsend this time, Who take her to a motel and now tries to convince her that Yates is lying and is a serial killer he was pursuing when they entered a ""black hole"" together. Before Dori could have the chance to believe him a S.W.A.T team surrounds the motel with Ramos  in charge. Ordering Townsend to surrender, Townsend, dragging Dori, escapes by going through the walls into adjacent rooms and steals a motel patron's car.

Still not being sure and Townsend having a gun, Dori helps Townsend find a cheap hotel to hold up but has second thoughts about him and she escapes him by running over him in a delivery van. Townsend hangs on but is scraped from underneath the van after holding onto the tailpipe. Dori finds Yates and take him to Townsend. Townsend, surprised at Dori, faces Yates who suddenly turns his gun on Dori and threaten to kill her if Townsend did not surrender the control card. Dori, surprised, as well, asked ""How could you both have traveled here and arrived differently?"" Yates sarcastically said that ""We entered the blackhole at the same time but we came out 20 years apart"". Still threaten Dori, Yates starts to torture her. Townsend relents and lays down his shotgun.

Looking at Townsend, Yates tells him to open his jacket where Townsend has a ""nasty scar"". Telling Yates he got it by being ran over by a van, Yates, mockingly jokes, ""You do look a little ""run down"" and turns to Dori and says mockingly, ""A joke"". With Yates distracted Townsend attacks him and both fight. Yates gets the upper hand, however, and has Townsend dangling from a terrace. Dori, seeing Townsend, attacks Yates but he hits her and places the muzzle of the gun in her mouth to kill her. Townsend, still dangling, reaches into his wound and produce a .38 caliber revolver and fires it into Yates' head where he falls onto electric wires, burst into flames and falls to the ground where he explodes and decomposes in less than 20 seconds.

The commotion brings Ramos to the hotel and finds Dori with Townsend's body. Ramos ask what happen and how did Townsend die this time. Dori came up with a plausible explanation to where Ramos ask ""Is that the truth?"" Dori's only answer is ""Well, it's my story and i'm sticking to it"".

Later, at the Medical Examiner's, Dori opens the vault that holds Townsend's body and looking down on him he opens his eyes and looks at her. She smiles and, holding the control card she says ""Surf's Up"". On the beach, Dori knowing that Townsend was going to try for his ship, with her head hanging down, she tells him ""Why do you even have to try?"" Townsend remarks, ""Because i am a Peacemaker!"" Dori, at last says ""I wish I could say a joke about now."" Townsend, sadly says ""Why? I would not understand it, anyway"".

"Prince Polo

Prince Polo is a Polish chocolate bar. It is sold in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania and Ukraine under the name Siesta, and is also sold in Iceland, where it is colloquially known as “Prins Póló”. According to measurements shown by Nielsen, the bar has been the most sold chocolate bar for decades in Iceland and was for many years one of the few chocolate bars available in the country. It has long been Poland's top-selling candy brand.

Prince Polo was introduced in 1955, during the early years of the Polish People's Republic, by Olza S.A. in Cieszyn. It is a chocolate-covered wafer, with four layers of wafer joined by three layers of chocolate-flavored filling; it was easily identifiable by its metallic gold-colored wrapper.

The company, which was founded in 1920, was purchased by Kraft Jacobs Suchard in 1993. In 1995 the Prince Polo packaging was revised with a new logo; the bar was no longer wrapped in paper and was instead sealed in plastic. Subsequently, several new varieties of Prince Polo were introduced, beginning with Hazelnut (Orzechowy) in 1996, and later milk chocolate, coconut, and Premium (claimed to be a more luxurious version). A larger XXL (52 g) size was also added.

In popular culture
 Prins Póló is an Icelandic indie-pop band/solo project/moniker of Svavar Pétur Eysteinsson, member of Icelandic alternative-rock band Skakkamanage
 ""Prins Póló"" is an Icelandic song by Sumargleðin performed by Magnús ""Bjössi Bolla"" Ólafsson, where he is nicknamed Prins Póló because of his love for the chocolate bar

"Walter Scott (Australian cricketer)

Walter Aubrey Scott (19 February 1907 – 23 October 1989) was an Australian cricketer who played a single first-class match for Victoria during the 1929–30 season. A right-handed batsman from Melbourne, Scott's sole match at first-class level came against Tasmania in February 1930, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Victoria scored 451 runs in its only innings to win by an innings and 95 runs, with Scott contributing 21 runs opening the batting with the team's captain, Edward Tolhurst. Aged 22 at the time of his debut, he did not play again at first-class level, but played two further matches for Victoria Country—against the touring South Africans during the 1931–32 season and against the touring MCC side the season after. Scott died in October 1989, aged 82.

Łagiewniki  () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Włocławek, within Włocławek County, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, in north-central Poland. It lies approximately  south of Włocławek and  south-east of Toruń.

Part of Łagiewniki was formerly known locally as Nowy Jork (Polish for New York), from a nickname given by the parish priest in the 1950s, perhaps due to its distance from the village centre or its perceived prosperity. This name came to be listed in the official records of place names, and was among the 365 names changed or delisted by the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs with effect from 1 January 2010. The delisting of Nowy Jork attracted nationwide television and press coverage.

"Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao

Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, billed as the Fight of the Century or the Battle for Greatness, was a professional boxing match between undefeated five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. It took place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mayweather Jr. won the contest by unanimous decision, with two judges scoring it 116–112 and the other 118–110. Although the fight was considered to be one of the most anticipated sporting events in history, it was largely considered a letdown by critics and audiences alike upon its broadcast.

Despite predictions that Mayweather–Pacquiao would be the highest-grossing fight in history as early as 2009, disagreements between the two professional boxers' camps on terms for the fight prevented the bout from coming to fruition until 2015. The failure to arrange the Mayweather–Pacquiao fight was named the 2010 Event of the Year by The Ring. Serious negotiations were kickstarted in 2014 by an unlikely source: a Hollywood waiter and part-time actor, Gabriel Salvador, made a key introduction between Pacquiao's trainer and confidant Freddie Roach and CBS President Les Moonves, who both worked to facilitate the match. By 2015, negotiations for the fight had been finalized, with all of the major issues that prevented the fight from happening in the past resolved, including purse split, drug testing and location.

The fight was televised through a pay-per-view (PPV) jointly produced by HBO and Showtime, the respective rightsholders of Pacquiao and Mayweather. In the Philippines, the fight was also broadcast in simulcast across three of the country's major broadcast television networks. The fight was expected to be the most lucrative in the history of professional boxing: with an initial estimate of 4.4 million purchases, the PPV alone broke revenue records in the United States (U.S.) with $410 million in revenue, making it the highest-grossing PPV in history, surpassing Mayweather–Álvarez in 2013. By September 2015, the figure had been amended to 4.6 million. The broadcast of the fight in the Philippines was watched by nearly half the country's households. Due to the record high price of the PPV, the fight was also widely broadcast through unauthorized online streams on services such as Periscope.

Despite the large amount of hype that surrounded it, critics felt that the bout itself was disappointing, primarily citing Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy in the ring and Pacquiao's difficulty in landing punches on Mayweather. This had led to some critics re-labelling the fight 'Better Never Than Late' rather than 'Fight of the Century'. It was later revealed following the event that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury to his right shoulder while training and that while it had healed in time for the fight, he re-injured it during the fourth round. Further controversy emerged when it was revealed that prior to the fight, Mayweather had been administered IV fluids cleared by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) through a retroactive ""therapeutic use exemption""—an exemption, however, not authorized by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC).

Background
When the fight was announced, Mayweather was 38 years old and still undefeated, with a perfect professional record of 47 wins and no losses. On June 6, 2008, six months after defeating Ricky Hatton by a tenth-round technical knockout, Mayweather announced his retirement from boxing. At the time, plans were in motion for a rematch with Oscar De La Hoya, which was going to take place September 20, 2008. ""This decision was not an easy one for me to make as boxing is all I have done since I was a child,"" Mayweather said. ""However, these past few years have been extremely difficult for me to find the desire and joy to continue in the sport."" At the time, 31-year-old Mayweather registered 39 wins and no losses in his historic career. At the time of his retirement, The Ring had Mayweather ranked as the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world, with Manny Pacquiao at No. 2.

During Mayweather's brief retirement, Pacquiao earned superstar status in much of the Western world with his eighth-round technical knockout victory over Oscar De La Hoya, for which he moved up from lightweight to welterweight (135 pounds to 147 pounds).

On May 2, 2009, the day of Pacquiao's fight against Ricky Hatton, Mayweather announced that he was coming out of retirement and would fight Juan Manuel Márquez, The Ring lightweight champion and No. 2 pound-for-pound fighter, on July 18, 2009, in a welterweight non-title fight. Márquez had previously fought Pacquiao in two controversial outings: they fought to a 12-round draw on May 8, 2004, and Pacquiao was awarded a 12-round split decision win on March 15, 2008. Mayweather played down Pacquiao's newfound stardom at his press conference, stating: ""If he wins tonight, don't be all shocked ... Cause guess what? I beat (Hatton) when he was undefeated. Pacquiao beat Oscar, it don't matter. Going down to 147 pounds was too much for (De La Hoya), he was dead after the first round. ... When you talk boxing, you talk Floyd Mayweather.""

Pacquiao would go on to defeat Hatton by a second-round knockout to win The Ring junior welterweight title. The win made him the second boxer in history to win titles in six weight divisions, the first being Oscar De La Hoya.

Mayweather vs. Márquez was postponed until September 19, 2009, due to a rib injury suffered by Mayweather. Despite being out of the ring for 21 months, Mayweather looked as sharp as ever and dominated the fight, winning by a lopsided 12-round unanimous decision. After the bout, Mayweather Promotions CEO Leonard Ellerbe stated that a fight with Pacquiao was the ""next obvious choice from a marketing standpoint.""

On November 14, 2009, Pacquiao stopped Puerto Rican star Miguel Cotto in round 12 to win the WBO welterweight title. Pacquiao's victory sparked a media frenzy and fans were quick to demand a fight between the two of them, despite the fact that the actual fight itself had not officially been made yet and would not take place until 2015.

First negotiations
On December 5, 2009, ESPN reported that Pacquiao signed a contract to fight Mayweather on March 13, 2010. Shortly afterward, Pacquiao denied ever signing a contract to fight Mayweather, telling FanHouse, ""There are still some things that need to be negotiated."" On December 11,
Golden Boy Promotions sent an eight-page contract to Top Rank, proposing a 50–50 financial split for a fight to take place on March 13, 2010. The contract was very detailed, including such matters as who would weigh-in first (Pacquiao), who would enter the ring first (Pacquiao) and who would be introduced first (Mayweather). The contract included an HBO PPV showing at a cost of $59.95. Billing was to be ""Mayweather vs. Pacquiao, presented by Top Rank, Golden Boy Promotions, Mayweather Promotions and M-P Promotions in association with [approved sponsors and the site]."" Also included in the contract was Olympic-style drug testing. Venues for the fight being discussed were Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and the Superdome in New Orleans.

In a video titled ""Boxing Legend Freddie Roach Updates Us On Pacquiao"" uploaded to YouTube on December 11, 2009, Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, revealed the first hint about Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing, telling roving reporter Elie Seckbach, ""I hear negotiations are a little shady. (Richard) Schaefer and them are unhappy about something. They want Olympic-style drug testing. I said, 'Yeah, no problem.' I said, 'Whatever you want.' Since we accepted that, now they're running scared again.""

On December 13, 2009, Pacquiao's adviser, Michael Koncz, said Mayweather's request for Olympic-style drug testing was a laughing matter and they had no concerns whatsoever about it. ""Our reaction is, 'So what?' We know Manny doesn't take any illegal drugs or anything. And none of this is getting under Manny's skin or anything. I'm here with Manny, and to him, it's like a joke. It's a laughing matter,"" said Koncz.

After reports had surfaced that both parties had agreed to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling to comply with the Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and CEO, declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent. ""We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, to me, just signaled that he didn't want the fight,"" Arum told David Mayo of the Grand Rapids Press.

Not long after declaring that the fight was off, Arum had a change of heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it deadline to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to three tests: one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and immediately after the fight. ""Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested ... It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures ... The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous,"" Arum explained. Freddie Roach told Lance Pugmire of the Los Angeles Times on December 22, 2009, that he would prefer for Pacquiao to give his final blood sample a week before the bout and no later than 72 hours before.

On December 28, 2009, video from an episode of HBO's Pacquiao–Hatton: 24/7 surfaced on the internet showing Pacquiao giving blood in the weeks leading up to his May 2, 2009, bout with Ricky Hatton. Documents confirmed that the video was recorded on April 8, 2009, 24 days prior to the fight and past the 30-day cut-off date that Pacquiao had demanded for a Mayweather fight. Pacquiao filed suit in U.S. District Court in Nevada on December 30, 2009, against Floyd Mayweather Jr., Floyd Mayweather Sr., Roger Mayweather, Mayweather Promotions and Golden Boy Promotions executives Oscar De La Hoya and Richard Schaefer, alleging that they made false and defamatory statements accusing him of taking performance-enhancing drugs.

Both sides agreed to enter into mediation on January 7, 2010, in hopes of coming to an agreement on the blood testing issue. Retired federal judge Daniel Weinstein, who successfully resolved a prior dispute between Top Rank and Golden Boy Promotions, would again act as mediator. Two days later, after hours of negotiating during mediation, Arum declared that the fight was officially off after Mayweather refused to agree to a 24-day cut-off date. Mayweather revealed that he offered a 14-day cut-off date to Team Pacquiao, but it was rejected.

Leonard Ellerbe declared on January 18, that random blood and urine testing will be implemented in all of Mayweather's future fights, regardless of the opponent. On February 13, in an exclusive interview with David Mayo of The Grand Rapids Press, Mayweather said, ""I gave him [Pacquiao] a chance, up to 14 days out. But my new terms are all the way up to the fight. They can come get us whenever, all the way up to the fight, random drug test. That's what it is.""

After the failed negotiations, both boxers moved on to other fights. On March 13, 2010, Pacquiao defeated Joshua Clottey via unanimous decision and on May 1, 2010, Mayweather beat Shane Mosley by a unanimous decision.

Reported second negotiations
On May 13, 2010, Bob Arum announced that he had penciled in November 13, 2010, as the date of Pacquiao's next fight, possibly against Mayweather. Pacquiao was quoted by the Manila Bulletin on May 20, as saying, ""As long as they're not getting a large amount of blood, I am willing to give out blood as close to two weeks before the fight."" On the same day, Mayweather revealed that he would be taking off the rest of 2010 and possibly 2011.

Arum declared on June 30, 2010, that there were no longer any issues and the decision was up to Mayweather. ""That's all been resolved,"" Arum stated to Kevin Iole of Yahoo Sports regarding the dispute over random blood and urine drug testing. Arum would also tell the Las Vegas Review-Journal, ""There's no longer any issues....The question is whether Mayweather is willing to fight this year."" He would reiterate that comment to the Manila Bulletin, stating, ""It's now up to Mayweather if he wants to fight.""

On July 13, Arum issued a July 16 midnight deadline for Mayweather. ""Mayweather has until the end of the week. He could wait until the last minute. If it's Friday [July 16] and it's 11 p.m., and he says we have a deal, we have a deal,"" Arum would explain to Dan Rafael of ESPN. On July 15, Top Rank's website unveiled an official countdown to the deadline entitled ""Money"" Time: Mayweather's Decision.

Denial of second negotiations
As soon as the deadline for Mayweather's response expired, Arum held a conference call. Arum revealed to the media that the negotiations he had been referring to consisted of a series of conversations with HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg. He also revealed that there was no actual direct communication with any representative from Team Mayweather or Golden Boy Promotions. ""I had a couple of conversations with Ross [Greenburg] and I laid out all the terms that would be acceptable to our side and I also informed him about the concession that Manny had made regarding drug testing. He got back to me in a couple of weeks and told me that he had had discussions with Al Haymon, representing Floyd Mayweather, and that everything looked good and we were nearing a resolution,"" Arum explained. During a Q & A session following his opening statement, Arum further explained, ""We have never talked to anybody on the Mayweather side and all conversations on our part were through Ross Greenburg and he reported on all conversations on the Mayweather side from Al Haymon.""

On July 19, 2010, Ellerbe denied that negotiations ever took place and said nothing was ever agreed on. ""Here are the facts: Al Haymon, Richard Schaefer and myself speak to each other on a regular basis and the truth is no negotiations have ever taken place nor was there ever a deal agreed upon by Team Mayweather or Floyd Mayweather to fight Manny Pacquiao on November 13. Either Ross Greenburg or Bob Arum is not telling the truth, but history tells us who is lying,"" stated Ellerbe. Three days later, Schaefer backed Ellerbe's statement that negotiations never took place.

Regarding comments he made suggesting that contracts for the megafight were close to being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, ""I think I said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.""

Also on July 26, Greenburg released a statement saying he had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, ""I had been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, carefully trying to put the fight together. Hopefully, someday this fight will happen. Sports fans deserve it,"" Greenburg revealed in a prepared statement sent out to select members of the media. Schaefer again supported Ellerbe's denial of negotiations and challenged both Greenburg and Arum to take lie detector tests. ""I think it's unfortunate that Ross made that statement. I fully stand behind the statement I made. I have not negotiated with Ross and I am not aware of any negotiations that have taken place,"" Schaefer told ESPN.

Continued disputes
On September 2, 2010, Mayweather unleashed a profanity-filled racist internet rant against Pacquiao via Ustream. He was misquoted as referring to Pacquiao as ""a yellow chump"" but he actually called him a ""little young chump"" and said, ""Once I stomp the midget, I’ll make that queer make me a sushi roll and cook me some rice."" In addition, he said, ""I'm going to cook that [expletive] with cats and dogs. Have some rice with a little barbecue dog."" The following day Mayweather apologized. ""I want to apologize to everybody.  ... I don't have a racist bone in my body, you know. I love everybody,"" Mayweather said. ""I was just having fun. I didn't really mean it, nothing in a bad way.""

On July 8, 2011, ESPN reported that Pacquiao was willing to agree to random drug testing—but not by USADA. ""We have agreed in the Pacquiao camp to unlimited random testing done by a responsible, neutral organization,"" Arum told Yahoo!. ""We don't believe USADA is a neutral organization. I don't think anybody's test is as vigorous as the test administered by the Olympic Organization. And we can arrange for the Olympic Organization to handle the test under the supervision of the Athletic commission respective of the state where the fight is going to be held."" However, the following day, Pacquiao's top adviser, Michael Koncz, stated that Pacquiao had never agreed to testing all the way up to fight day. ""Will we give blood five days, seven days before the fight? You know, that's something I have to talk to Manny about, but we have nothing to hide,"" Koncz said.

On January 20, 2012, Mayweather spoke directly to Pacquiao via telephone. ""He ask about a 50/50 split,"" Mayweather said. ""I told him no that can't happen, but what can happen is you can make more money fighting me then you have made in your career."" Mayweather offered to pay a flat fee of USD 40 million for a proposed fight but would not allow Pacquiao to share in the revenue. Pacquiao said, ""I spoke to Floyd ...and he offered me an amount. He didn't talk about the pay-per-views here and that's it. I can't agree with that. I told him I agree with 55 and 45 (split).""

Pacquiao appeared on the ESPN program First Take on September 20, 2012, and said he had no problem with the drug-testing issue. ""Whatever he wants to do,"" Pacquiao said. He said he was willing to be tested even on the night of the fight. On September 25, Mayweather and Pacquiao reached a confidential settlement in their federal defamation case. In a statement released through the mediator in the case, the Mayweathers said they ""wish to make it clear that they never intended to claim that Manny Pacquiao has used or is using any performance-enhancing drugs, nor are they aware of any evidence that Manny Pacquiao has used performance-enhancing drugs.""

The Telegraph reported on December 20, that Mayweather said Pacquiao’s association with promoter Bob Arum is the reason why the bout will not happen. ""We all know the Pacquiao fight, at this particular time, will never happen, and the reason why the fight won't happen is because I will never do business with Bob Arum again in life, and Pacquiao is Bob Arum's fighter,"" Mayweather said.

On January 7, 2014, Fighthype.com published an interview with Mayweather in which he called Pacquiao a ""desperate dog"" who is chasing a megabout due to his tax problems. In response, Pacquiao challenged Mayweather to a fight for charity. ""I challenge him to include in our fight contract that both of us will not receive anything out of this fight,"" Pacquiao said. ""We will donate all the proceeds from the fight—guaranteed prize, should there be any, gate receipts, pay-per-view and endorsements—to charities around the world."" He added, ""Floyd, if you’re a real man, fight me. Let’s do it for the love of boxing and for the fans. Let’s do it not for the sake of money. Let’s make the boxing fans happy.""

Successful negotiations
As reported by at least five major media outlets (USA Today, Los Angeles Times, The Hollywood Reporter, The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post), serious negotiations leading to success were kickstarted in May 2014 by a very unlikely source: a Hollywood waiter/actor named Gabriel Salvador (Bones, Bluebloods, Rizzoli & Isles, CSI). Salvador forged a friendship with CBS Network President Leslie Moonves when Moonves became a regular at Craig's restaurant in West Hollywood, where Salvador worked part-time as a waiter and where his son Elijah worked out at Freddie Roach's gym. Salvador and Moonves bonded over their mutual love of boxing. CBS is the parent company of the Showtime Network, which had invested heavily in boxing and spent top-dollar on a multi-year deal with Mayweather. Salvador told Moonves that he believed he could make the fight happen if he could get Moonves together with Pacquiao confidant and trainer Roach. Salvador believed he could do so based on his connection to both men and his ""unshakeable feeling"" that together they could cut through the politicking and power struggles that seemed to have stymied prior negotiations. Moonves agreed that Salvador should approach Roach to make an introduction with a view to making the fight a reality. Eventually, Salvador approached Roach and asked him if he would be willing to meet with Moonves to get the wheels in motion. Roach agreed and asked Salvador to set up a meeting.

The first meeting between Moonves and Roach took place on May 28, 2014, at the Scarpetta restaurant in the Montage Hotel in Beverly Hills, which Salvador attended. Both Roach and Moonves agreed the long-awaited bout had to happen and Roach gave Moonves the green-light to start making things happen. Roach later helped Moonves make peace with Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum. Moonves then brought the warring elements from both boxers' camps together and, with Salvador's help, even arranged meetings at his home. After difficult negotiations, it was not long after that both camps agreed to fight on the night of May 2, 2015. The consensus is that but for Salvador's key introduction, the fight would not have happened. Both Moonves and Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum have confirmed Salvador's pivotal role.

For his role, Salvador maintains that he is a ""finder"" entitled to a finder's fee. But Salvador has yet to be paid that fee by either CBS or Roach/Pacquiao. The fight grossed more than $600 million, with the television networks taking in more than $400 million and Pacquiao grossing more than $160 million.

On December 12, 2014, Mayweather proposed a May 2, 2015, fight with Pacquiao, citing his indirect frustration at not being able to make the fight happen in the past by stating that Pacquiao had lost to both Juan Manuel Márquez and Timothy Bradley respectively. He also stated that he (Pacquiao) was ""not on his level"". Mayweather then went on to close his comments with, ""Let's make this fight happen for the people and for the fans.""

On January 13, Pacquiao agreed to terms for the fight. Bob Arum claimed that now only Mayweather's camp was holding up an official agreement. On January 27, Mayweather and Pacquiao finally met each other face to face for the first time during an NBA game between the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks in Miami. Pacquiao said they exchanged phone numbers and would communicate with each other. Pacquiao's advisor, Michael Koncz, said that the two future Hall of Famers later met at Pacquiao's hotel for about an hour to discuss the pending superfight and work out the remaining issues. Top Rank promoter Bob Arum expressed optimism that the fight could be finalized by Super Bowl Sunday at the soonest and that there would be no further deadlines for the fight, stating that the negotiations are nearly complete. On January 30, TMZ reported that the fight had been agreed upon by both sides and that a formal announcement would be made in the ""next couple of days."" However, members from both sides, including Bob Arum and Stephen Espinoza, refuted the report, saying that the deal had not been finalized yet and that negotiations on what would be a joint pay-per-view (Showtime–HBO) telecast of the fight were still clearing out the last significant issues before the deal could be finalized.

On February 20, Mayweather announced that the fight was official and a contract had been signed for a fight to take place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The fight was expected to shatter PPV buy records and gross millions of dollars with the ticket prices ranging from $3,500 to $250,000 and the PPV was expected to cost USD 89.95 for SD and USD 99.95 for HD. Boxing experts predicted the match would be the richest fight in boxing history and would generate $300 million.

Fight details
Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. Tickets for the fight went on sale on April 23 after an agreement had been reached over ticket allocation. Only 500 tickets went on sale to the public, priced at $1,500, $2,500, $3,500, $5,000 and $7,500 for the 16,800 capacity MGM Grand. The tickets that went on sale sold out within a minute. As per the contract, the first $160 million of revenue and the revenue above $180 million from the fight was split 60/40 between the fighters, with Mayweather receiving the larger 60% share. Revenue between $160 million and $180 million was to be split 51/49, with the 51% share going to the winner. Both fighters were expected to earn at least $100 million in revenue from their participation. Although the event was jointly promoted by Mayweather Promotions and Top Rank, the contract named Mayweather Promotions as the lead promoter of the fight. Both fighters agreed to undergo drug testing by the United States Anti-Doping Agency, including random blood and urine testing prior to the fight, a test following the fight and a ban from professional boxing for four years if they test positive. Neither fighter has failed a drug test during their professional career.

Kenny Bayless served as the in-ring referee, as chosen by the Nevada Athletic Commission. Bayless has previously officiated five of Mayweather's past bouts and seven of Pacquiao's and he earned a record $25,000 for officiating this fight. Burt Clements, Dave Moretti and Glenn Feldman served as judges. The U.S. national anthem, ""The Star-Spangled Banner"", was performed by Jamie Foxx. The Philippine national anthem, ""Lupang Hinirang"", was performed by Filipino-American singer Gail Banawis, joined by The Word Chorale—a choir of Filipino pastors.

A large number of celebrities were in attendance; singer Justin Bieber was among Mayweather's entourage, while Pacquiao was joined by comedian Jimmy Kimmel—who had discussed the possibility of entering with him when Pacquiao appeared on his talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live. Kimmel wore an outfit parodying Bieber's wardrobe from a pre-fight press conference and photobombed a pre-fight photo taken by Pacquiao. Other figures in attendance included Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Charles Barkley, Mike Tyson, Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, Michael J. Fox, Donald Trump, Jake Gyllenhaal, Amir Khan, Drew Barrymore, Jesse Jackson, Russell Westbrook, Mark Wahlberg, Lewis Hamilton, Leonardo DiCaprio, Don Cheadle, Michael Jordan, Sugar Ray Leonard, Paris Hilton, Nicki Minaj, Meek Mill, Ben Affleck, The Jonas Brothers, Michael Keaton, Tom Brady, Magic Johnson, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Evander Holyfield, Mariah Carey, Sting, 50 Cent and others.

Broadcasting
As both Pacquiao and Mayweather had exclusive relationships with the broadcasters, HBO and Showtime, at the time of the fight, the telecast of the fight was a joint production between HBO World Championship Boxing and Showtime Championship Boxing. This marked the first collaboration between the two American premium television services since Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson in 2002. It was executive produced and directed by Showtime's David Dinkins Jr. and Bob Dunphy and featured a mix of Showtime and HBO personalities. The ringside announcers for the fight included Roy Jones Jr. (HBO), Al Bernstein (Showtime) and Jim Lampley (HBO) provided analysis. Max Kellerman (HBO) and Jim Gray (Showtime) covered the locker rooms of Pacquiao and Mayweather, respectively. James Brown and Paulie Malignaggi of Showtime hosted the pre-fight show.

The broadcast was, in most regions, distributed as a pay-per-view event. In the United States, the PPV cost was USD 89.95 (with an additional $10 charge for HD), a 40% increase over the PPV cost of Mayweather's 2013 fight against Canelo Álvarez. Rights to screen the fight in commercial venues such as bars and restaurants were administered by G&G Sports, with costs based upon venue size and other factors, reaching as high as $5,000 for a 257-seat establishment. Due to concerns that they may not have been able to recoup the cost of the PPV through cover charges and drink sales, some bars decided against screening the fight at all. Both HBO and Showtime aired encores of the fight the following Saturday, May 9, 2015.

Both Showtime and HBO broadcast documentary specials focusing on the two fighters as part of the lead-up to the fight; Showtime produced the Mayweather-focused Inside Mayweather vs. Pacquiao—with three episodes focusing on Mayweather's preparations for the event and an epilogue which aired the week following the fight, while HBO aired a one-hour Pacquiao-focused Mayweather/Pacquiao: At Last, as well as encores of past Pacquiao fights. Showtime's sister outlet CBS Sports Network also aired supplemental programming, including encores of Inside Mayweather vs. Pacquiao and past Mayweather fights, live coverage of the weigh-in, special broadcasts of The Doug Gottlieb Show and Boomer and Carton from Las Vegas and coverage of the post-fight press conference.

International broadcasting
In Pacquiao's native country of the Philippines, Solar Entertainment held broadcast rights to the fight, reportedly paying $10 million (PHP 440 million). The telecast was made available via commercial free pay-per-view on the television providers Cignal and SkyCable, and at the locations of theatre chain SM Cinema (including IMAX theaters) and the Mall of Asia Arena. Unlike previous Pacquiao fights, whose free-to-air rights were held by GMA Network as part of a sub-licensing arrangement, a ""slightly-delayed"" telecast of the fight was simulcast by Solar Sports, GMA and the rival commercial networks ABS-CBN and TV5. Solar Sports President Wilson Tieng said that Pacquiao personally requested the joint broadcast due to its historic nature, and that ""everybody agreed to set aside all their differences to make sure that this will become the biggest event ever in Philippine television history."" GMA held exclusive radio rights to the fight.

In Europe, generally, the fight was broadcast via PPV (Austria, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Spain). Only a few TV holders in Europe decided otherwise – TVP (Poland), Sport 1 (Czech Republic and Hungary) and Discovery Italy (Deejay TV and DMAX). Sky Sports Box Office won exclusive television rights in the UK to the bout, and produced a four episode broadcast leading up to the event titled Mayweather vs. Pacquiao: Countdown.

Sportsmax TV and Cleeng offered the fight via PPV in 19 Caribbean countries, including Barbados, Jamaica, Surinam and Trinidad & Tobago.

Piracy and streaming
Due to the high profile of the event and the high price of the PPV, there were significant concerns surrounding piracy of the fight's telecast by either bars (which were required to purchase a higher-priced commercial license to televise the event, and were not legally allowed to purchase it through their television provider) or by online streaming services, with TorrentFreak going on to report that Mayweather vs. Pacquiao was ""destined to become the most pirated live sports event in history"". Organizers were especially concerned about the mobile broadcasting apps Meerkat and Periscope due to their relative ease of use and accessibility, as viewers could simply film their television screen with their phones to make a stream available.

Alongside monitoring activities during the event, actions were also preemptively taken against several sites that advertised plans to illegally stream the fight. In the Philippines, the Philippine National Police's Anti-Cybercrime Group arrested the operator of a streaming service after a complaint by ABS-CBN and was granted a temporary restraining order in a Florida court for its infringements of copyrights and trademarks. HBO and Showtime filed a similar lawsuit against two other streaming services that advertised an intent to offer the fight under  (which allows for preemptive claims of copyright infringement against those conspiring to infringe the copyrights of a broadcast) and a court issued a restraining order against the sites and all parties in ""active concert or participation with any of them, including any and all service providers who receive notice of this order"". The Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the wide reach of the order, arguing that the clause of ""any and all service providers who receive notice of this order"" was comparable to the provisions of the previously proposed Stop Online Piracy Act, theorizing that other parties not originally named could become subject to the injunction by merely receiving notice of the order.

A large number of Periscope streams were used to broadcast the fight, either indirectly with a focus on reactions from viewing parties, or simply rebroadcasting television feeds of the fight. One stream reportedly peaked at around 10,000 viewers, although these streams had inconsistent uptime due either to connection issues or to being reported and taken down by the service. Representatives of both Meerkat and Periscope reported that they acted upon takedown notices received throughout the evening. ESPN's Ryan McGee dubbed Periscope the ""winner"" of the fight due to the prominence it received through this manner. Dick Costolo, CEO of microblogging service and Periscope parent company Twitter, made a similar remark; although it was initially assumed to be in reference to the illegal streams, he clarified that it was actually in reference to HBO's usage of the service to stream behind-the-scenes from the fighters' locker rooms.

Belt
The winner of the fight received a newly created belt by the WBC. The belt, valued at $1 million, is an exact replica of the current belt, except it has thousands of emeralds in place of the gold plating for the center logo. The belt also contains the faces of both Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao, along with the faces of the former WBC President, José Sulaimán and boxing legend Muhammad Ali. Two belts were initially made for the fight. The green emerald belt won the public fan vote over the black onyx belt with a vote of 53% to 47%.

Gloves
Both fighters wore eight-ounce (230 g) gloves with brands of their choosing. Mayweather wore custom Grant gloves with a multicolored paisley pattern, red & purple trim and the letters TBE (The Best Ever) on the cuff. Pacquiao wore standard red Cleto Reyes gloves with black & white trim. In Pacquiao's third professional loss to Érik Morales, he was forced to use Winning brand gloves the first time around. Pacquiao's complaints were that the gloves felt like ""pillows"" and they did not give him the same power as his Reyes ""puncher's gloves."" More recently, Mayweather had glove issues in his first bout with Marcos Maidana, stating that Maidana's Everlast MX gloves did not provide sufficient padding for the knuckles. The issue was later resolved with Marcos Maidana resorting to using Everlast Powerlock type gloves, leaving Maidana's trainer, Robert Garcia, unhappy with the negotiation.

Fighters' gear
Mayweather's trunks were designed by Dapper Dan, a Harlem-based hip-hop fashion designer. At least five possible outfits were created for the fight. FanDuel, a daily fantasy sports website, acquired sponsorship rights to have their logo appear on his waistband. Pacquiao's gear was provided by Nike.

Mayweather commissioned specially-designed mouthguards for the fight by Dr. Lee Gause, owner of Iceberg Guards, costing $25,000. Along with ""subtle"" clear pairs, some of them contained gold leaf, diamond dust and an embedded $100 bill. Iceberg Guards also released a limited-edition TMT-branded mouthguard to tie in with the fight. Pacquiao's mouthguard was designed by Dr. Ed Dela Vega of Canoga Park, Los Angeles, who has custom-fit mouthguards for Pacquiao and other Philippine boxers. It featured a multi-colored design with a blend of the colors from the flag of the Philippines, meant to represent the different ethnic groups that support him. Unlike Mayweather's, this mouthguard was supplied as a gift to Pacquiao; Vega argued that Mayweather's high-cost mouthguard was simply ""hype"" meant to ""rub it in the face of boxers who can't afford it"".

Sponsors
A bidding war ensued between Corona and Tecate—which had respectively served as prominent sponsors of previous Mayweather and Pacquiao fights—for lead sponsorship rights to the fight. Tecate won the sponsorship deal with a bid of $5.6 million, beating a bid of $5.2 million by Corona. As part of the deal, Tecate's logo was visible on all promotional material for the fight. Pacquiao was expected to feature a number of major sponsorships on his gear, providing an estimated $2.25 million in additional revenue. Among them were long-time sponsors, such as Air Asia, Cafe Puro and Motolite. Daily fantasy sports service FanDuel acquired sponsorship rights for Mayweather, including waistband branding and a block of tickets that were given away through an on-site sweepstakes. The King, a mascot of fast food chain Burger King, was among Mayweather's entourage entering the arena.

Merchandise
Prior to the fight, Nike launched a line of Pacquiao-oriented merchandise carrying his logo and the slogans ""Do What They Say You Can't"" and ""#MannyDoes"". Demand for Mayweather merchandise was also heavy, including apparel branded under the Mayweather Promotions and The Money Team (TMT) labels amongst others.

From April 24, 2015, through the day of the fight, a MayPac pop-up store operated on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Fremont Street. It sold merchandise for both fighters and featured interactive displays and fan-oriented events.

Aftermath

Revenue and viewership
The fight lived up to revenue expectations, generating somewhere between $300 million and $400 million in gross revenue according to early estimates (including announced ticket sales totalling $72,198,500), which would surpass Super Bowl XLIX. Due to the possibility of high demand, viewers were encouraged to pre-order the PPV: a HBO representative reported that the fight had attracted more pre-orders than any other PPV event in the broadcaster's history. Despite the guidance, a high volume of last-minute orders overwhelmed the systems of several major U.S. television providers and resulted in various technical issues, such as difficulties ordering or viewing the PPV and outages that affected unrelated channels as well for some viewers. To address these issues, the main event was pushed back 45 minutes from its originally projected start time of 8:15 p.m. PT (11:15 p.m. ET), to 9:00 p.m PT (12:00 a.m. ET).

The fight broke PPV viewership records in the United States, with 4.6 million buys and over $410 million in revenue, surpassing the previous $150 million revenue record set by Floyd Mayweather vs. Canelo Álvarez, the 2.48 million buy record set by 2007's Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr. and a pre-fight estimate of $270 million from three million households. In the Philippines, Kantar ratings estimated that the fight was watched across the three-network consortium by 46.9% of Filipino households; of the three networks simulcasting the fight, ABS-CBN had the largest number of viewers, with a rating share of 24%.

Due to hundreds of business jets filling up the stands, McCarran International Airport was closed for non-airline flights during the event days. By contrast, the typically bustling streets of the Philippine capital Manila were nearly empty during the fight.

Post-fight remarks
After the fight, Mayweather remarked ""[Pacquiao] definitely had his moments in the fight. As long as I moved on the outside, I was able to stay away from those. He’s a really smart fighter ... My dad wanted me to do more, but I had to take my time. Because Manny Pacquiao is a competitor, and he’s extremely dangerous."" Mayweather said he would retire after his next fight, the opponent of which is not yet decided. Pacquiao said ""I thought I won the fight. He’s moving around. It’s not easy to throw punches when he’s moving around so much ... I thought I caught him many more times than he caught me."" Citing the stats that showed he possibly should have won the fight, Pacquiao has continued to maintain he should have been awarded the decision. On the possibility of a rematch, Mayweather stated on May 9, 2015, that he had no plans to fight Pacquiao again ""at this particular time"", referring to him as being a ""sore loser"" and a ""coward"".

Pacquiao shoulder injury
Hours after the fight, Pacquiao's team disclosed that he had injured his right shoulder in April during a training exercise. The injury was partially healed, but Pacquiao requested and was denied an injection of legal painkillers before the fight. Pacquiao said he re-injured the shoulder in the fourth round of the fight and was ineffective after that. On May 4, a representative of the Nevada State Athletic Commission said that it was looking into why Pacquiao had stated he had no shoulder injuries on pre-fight questionnaire and was considering fining or suspending him for the deception. Pacquiao's team responded with a statement saying the United States Anti-Doping Agency had been informed of the injury, but USADA head Travis Tygart said Pacquiao's team had only asked about the legality of certain substances for use on an unspecified shoulder injury and had provided ""no medical information, no MRIs, no documents"". Mayweather initially stated that he would be open to the possibility of a rematch with Pacquiao once he had recovered from his shoulder injury, but he changed his mind before talks of a rematch were in the works. Pacquiao later underwent surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff and was out of action for nine months to one year.

Mayweather's IV injection
After weighing in for the fight on May 1, Mayweather received an intravenous injection for the stated purpose of pre-bout re-hydration. The two IV infusions were administered at his home, amounted to 16% of the total average male blood quantity, and contained saline, multivitamins and vitamin C. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) forbids such a large amount of fluids entering the body before competition as a preventive step against the possible masking of performance-enhancing drug use. Bob Bennett, the executive director of the NSAC, stated that unless the IV was administered at a hospital, it needs to be cleared by filing a therapeutic-use exemption, and supporting documents through the Nevada commission and authorized by the commission’s medical expert. The Pacquiao camp had requested an injection of the anti-inflammatory Toradol for Pacquiao's injured shoulder before the fight, but was denied authorization by the NSAC. USADA authorized both injections, but the NSAC was not informed of Mayweather's IV until after the fight.

Reception
The fight itself left many fans disappointed. Forbes.com contributor Brian Goff called it ""arguably, the least entertaining 'mega fight' in memory"", attributing the disappointment to Mayweather's defense-oriented strategy, which is atypical of top boxers. The New York Times felt that the bout was ""far from electrifying and had some fans grumbling about Mayweather’s methodical defensive style"". Los Angeles Times columnist Bill Dwyre felt that the fight was ""as compelling as the 405 freeway at 8 a.m."". Regarding Pacquiao's undisclosed shoulder injury, he called the entire situation very damaging to boxing, accusing the fight's promoters of allowing the fight to go on for monetary reasons, and potentially alienating fans. Dwyre went on to say that ""This was billed the Fight of the Century. As The Wall Street Journal so aptly put it, it's good that we have 85 years left to top it."" Former heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield, who thought that Pacquiao should have been awarded the decision, questioned the judging of not just this fight but recent prize fights in general in an essay in The Players' Tribune.

Lawsuits
On May 5, 2015, two Las Vegas residents filed a class-action lawsuit against Pacquiao, his manager and Top Rank, for failing to disclose Pacquiao's injury before the fight. The plaintiffs felt that their actions deceived those who bought tickets or the PPV or bet on the fight and violated the rules of the NSAC. The complaints will be heard by a Los Angeles judge, who will determine whether they may go to trial.

In May 2016, Showtime Networks also sued Top Rank over the injury, claiming that the promoter violated an indemnification agreement.

Rematch
On September 15, 2018, both Mayweather and Pacquiao posted videos on Instagram depicting an encounter between the two at Ultra Japan, speculating the possibility of a rematch. Mayweather's stated in his posting of the video that the fight would happen ""this year"" and described it as ""another nine-figure pay day on the way"" and was heard remarking to Pacquiao that he was going to ""take [the belt] from you like I did before"". In Pacquiao's video (posted with the comment ""50–1 #NoExcuses""), Mayweather was heard mentioning the ""second of December"". It is unknown if any formal negotiations have actually occurred.

On September 19, 2018, Mayweather clarified his calls for a rematch, stating that he planned to hold a fight in Japan first before any possible rematch.

On November 4, 2018, it was announced that Mayweather would fight undefeated Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa on New Year's Eve. It will be a three-round exhibition boxing match. In the one-sided fight, Nasukawa was knocked down three times in the first round and his corner subsequently threw the towel in.

"Lakes Region Facility

Lakes Region Facility was a state prison in Laconia, Belknap County, New Hampshire, in the United States. The facility was operated by the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, and has been closed as of June 30, 2009  as a result of the late-2000s recession.

The Lakes Region Facility was a minimum custody transitional facility. Its capacity is 400 inmates but averaged about 300 male inmates. The warden of the facility oversaw inmates housed there as well as inmates in the Calumet and North End Transitional Housing Units, as well as The Transitional Work Center. Lakes Region Facility minimum-security offenders provided over 30,000 hours of community service to state and county agencies and Laconia-area non-profit organizations. The Lakes Region Facility employed 153 people, including 105 corrections officers and 48 non-uniformed employees.

Lakes Region was a minimum security transitional prison.  In 2004, it became an entirely male facility: minimum security female prisoners were relocated to the Shea Farm Halfway House in Concord, New Hampshire.

"Great Hypostyle Hall

The Great Hypostyle Hall is located within the Karnak temple complex, in the Precinct of Amon-Re. It is one of the most visited monuments of Ancient Egypt. The structure was built around the 19th Egyptian Dynasty (c. 1290–1224 BC). Its design was initially instituted by Hatshepsut, at the North-west chapel to Amun in the upper terrace of Deir el-Bahri. The name refers to hypostyle architectural pattern.

Architecture and Construction 

The Great Hypostyle Hall covers an area of . The roof, now fallen, was supported by 134 columns in 16 rows; the 2 middle rows are higher than the others (being  in circumference and  high).

The 134 papyrus columns represent the primeval papyrus swamp from which Amun, a self-created deity, arose from the waters of chaos at the beginning of creating.

The hall was not constructed by Horemheb, or Amenhotep III as earlier scholars had thought but was built entirely by Seti I who engraved the northern wing of the hall with inscriptions.  Decoration of the southern wing was completed by the 19th dynasty pharaoh Ramesses II.

Inscriptions and Reliefs 

A series of succeeding pharaohs added inscriptions to the walls and the columns in places their predecessors had left blank, including Ramesses III, Ramesses IV and Ramesses VI. The northern side of the hall is decorated in raised relief, and was mainly Seti I's work. The southern side of the hall was completed by Ramesses II, in sunk relief although he used raised relief at the very beginning of his reign before changing to the sunk relief style and re-editing his own raised reliefs. Ramesses II also usurped decoration of his father along the main north-south and east-west processional ways of the hall, giving the casual observer the idea that he was responsible for the building. However, most of Seti I's reliefs in the northern part of the hall were respected.

The outer walls depict scenes of battle, Seti I on the north and Ramesses II on the south. Although these reliefs had religious and ideological functions, they are important records of the wars of these kings.  On another wall adjoining the south wall of the Hall is a record of Ramesses II's peace treaty with the Hittites that he signed in Year 21 of his reign.

In 1899, 11 of the massive columns of the Great Hypostyle Hall collapsed in a chain reaction, because their foundations were undermined by ground water. Georges Legrain, who was then the chief archaeologist in the area, supervised the rebuilding that was completed in May 1902. Later, similar work had to continue in order to strengthen the rest of the columns of the Temple.

"ISA 230 Documentation

ISA 230 Audit Documentation is one of the International Standards on Auditing. It serves to direct the documentation of audit working papers in order to assist the audit planning and performance; the supervision and review of the audit work; and the recording of audit evidence resulting from the audit work in order to support the auditor's opinion.

ISA 230 statements
The auditor should prepare, on a timely basis, audit documentation that provides:

A sufficient and appropriate record of the basis for the audit report
Evidence that the audit was performed in accordance with ISA's and applicable legal and  regulatory requirements (Paragraph 2).

The auditor should prepare the audit documentation so as to enable an experienced auditor, having no previous connection with the audit, to understand:

 The nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures performed to comply with ISAs and applicable legal and regulatory requirements;
 The results of the audit procedures and the audit evidence obtained;
 Significant matters arising during the audit and the conclusions reached thereon. (Paragraph 9)

Oral explanations by the auditor, on their own, do not represent adequate support for the work the auditor performed or conclusions the auditor reached, but may be used to clarify or explain information contained in the audit documentation. (Paragraph 11) This is not true, Oral explanations are only referenced on paragraph 11 of AU section 339 therefore does not refer to ISA.

The audit file must effectively stand on its own. Whilst the auditor may clarify what has been documented the facility to explain detailed aspects of the audit has gone, so this must mean more extensive working papers in some areas.

In documenting the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures performed, the auditor should record the identifying characteristics of the specific items or matters being tested. (Paragraph 12)

In documenting the nature, timing and extent of audit procedures performed, the auditor should record:

 Who performed the audit work and the date such work was completed; and
 Who reviewed the audit work performed and the date and extent of such review. (Paragraph 23)

The standard also establishes clear responsibilities for the auditor to assemble the final audit file on a timely basis and sets out specific requirements regarding deletions, modifications or additions to audit documentation after the date of the auditor's report. 

There are also documentation requirements in the exceptional circumstance when an auditor judges it necessary to depart from a basic principle or essential procedure that is relevant in the circumstances of the audit. The auditor should document how the alternative procedures performed achieve the objective of the audit and, unless otherwise clear, the reasons for the departure.

"Laforet

is a department store, residence, and museum complex located in the Harajuku commercial and entertainment district of the Shibuya neighborhood, in Tokyo, Japan. 

Constructed over part of the old Tokyo Central Church, a newer church located behind the store, Laforet was opened in 1978.
It was built by developer Mori Building, that had developed several sites across Tokyo, as well as (subsequently) the Roppongi Hills Mori Tower, and at the time of opening it was one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo.

The name Mori, in Japanese, is the word for ""forest"" (森), and the name of the complex was a pun derived from that, it being simply the French words ""la forêt"" for ""the forest"".

The complex has six floors and two basements, divided into half levels; with 150 shops, and the Laforet Museum on the top floor.

It has had a long association with youth fashion culture, although this was not originally intended.
Although fashion brands such as Hysteric Glamour and Ba-tsu opened their first boutiques there, originally its interior was more staid and conventional for the times.
Unfortunately for its developers, this resulted in low sales in the first year of business, causing Ryotu Matsumoko of Ba-stu to be brought in to remodel the interior of the store, changing it to a more youthful and ""edgy"" design for the time, replacing long and deep stores with wide and shallow stores visible in ""panopticon"" fashion by shoppers from a central stairwell.

The same was true of its fashion promotion advertising image, originally designed by U.S. firm Antonio Lopez, which was not particularly successful until taken over by Takuya Onuki, who in the middle 1990s switched the advertising campaigns from female models wearing brand clothes to quirky images such as the ""Nude"" brand of Americans going about their daily business dressed only in underwear, and dogs in denim.

Following the increase in youth fashion culture of the times, Laforet took to partnering with youth fashion magazines and clothing brands to run fashion shows in the building during the 1980s and 1990s.
A victim of its own success, with the independent innovators that were originally attracted being acquired by and assimilated into commercial interests, Laforet's fashion shows went into decline in the late 1990s.

A new roster of boutiques began to turn its fortunes around in 2006.

"Régis Labeaume

Régis Labeaume (born May 2, 1956) is a Canadian businessman, writer and politician, currently serving as mayor of Quebec City. He was first elected on December 2, 2007 after the death of former mayor Andrée Boucher. He was reelected in 2009, 2013, and 2017.

Early life
Labeaume holds a bachelor's degree in sociology from the Université Laval. Prior to being mayor, Labeaume was a local businessman and chair of the Fondation de l’entrepreneurship organisation since 2003 and worked primarily in the mining industry. He was previously the political adviser of former Communications Minister and former Parti Québécois MNA of the riding of Vanier, Jean-François Bertrand from 1980 to 1983. He also collaborated to two books on the Quebec mining industry and on small and medium enterprises.

Municipal politics in Quebec City
In 2005, he made an attempt to be elected leader of the municipal political party Renouveau municipal de Québec but lost to 2007 candidate Claude Larose

First mayoral term
Labeaume was elected on December 2, 2007, in a special election following the death of Andrée Boucher. He was elected with over 59 percent of the vote, defeating candidate Ann Bourget who was the front-runner until the campaign's last few days. She finished second with 32% of the votes, followed by former Quebec Liberal Party Minister of Justice and lawyer Marc Bellemare. Labeaume obtained the support of key local figures, including Marc Boucher, husband of the late Andrée Boucher, and former mayor Gilles Lamontagne.

Throughout his first term as mayor, Labeaume focused on making the city a major tourist destination. He was keen on the idea of a New Quebec City Amphitheatre. With the 400th Anniversary of the city in 2008, Quebec City's image changed in the eyes of many. After the festivities, the mayor promised to keep investing to make Quebec City an appealing destination.

During his first mandate as mayor, Labeaume also developed a reputation for speaking his mind and not always using the right words in front of the media. In October 2009 he made some scathing comments about federal minister Josée Verner. On a pre-recorded interview on Télé-Québec, he declared, “I get along well with Ms. Verner, but sometimes I could just smack her. Those culture cuts, I just don't agree with them.” He later made public excuses and explained that he only wanted to express his anger about the recent cuts in culture by the federal government.

A study based on 68000 texts and reports broadcast in Quebec between April 1, 2008, and March 31, 2009, showed that Labeaume was the mayor with the most media coverage in Quebec, with 54.4% of the coverage. In another study in 2008, Labeaume ranked 10th in a list of the most mediatised personalities in Quebec, along with the then newly elected American president Barack Obama, Guy Carbonneau (coach of the Montreal Canadiens), and Stephen Harper.

Second mayoral term
On November 1, 2009, on the night of Québec's municipal elections, Labeaume was reelected by an overwhelming majority of 79,7% against 8,6% for the radio host Jean-François Jeff Fillion and 8,1% for Yonnel Bonaventure and the Défi Vert de Québec party. Labeaume's party, l'Équipe Labeaume, also elected a councillor in 25 of the 27 districts. Only the districts of Vieux-Québec-Montcalm and Saint-Sacrement-Belvédère elected independent councillors. With this vast majority at the city council, Labeaume declared his intention to make Quebec City the most appealing city in Canada and that in 15 years, the city would be greener, more efficient and more active.

Third mayoral term
On November 3, 2013, Labeaume was reelected with 74.1% of the vote and 18 out of 21 candidates from l'Équipe Labeaume were elected councillors.

Labeaume has stated that he supports legislation banning the wearing of the niqāb or burqa in public spaces.

A new Colisée in Québec
A couple of months before the elections of December 2009, on October 16 Labeaume announced his intention to go forward with the project of the new indoor arena. He announced a new Colisée of 18000 seats would be built besides the old Colisée Pepsi. The estimated $400 million cost would be paid in part by the federal and provincial governments. When asked if this kind of announcement was justified before the elections, Labeaume answered he wanted to be transparent and that the announcement should be seen as an electoral engagement.

On September 10, 2010, Quebec premier Jean Charest announced the province would be ready to pay 45% percent of the bill for the new arena if Ottawa would do the same. At this point, Labeaume and his team were still waiting for the federal answer.

In December 2010, after a couple of months of speculation, Prime minister Harper announced the government had no intention of paying for these kinds of installations. The money would have to come from the private sector.

In March 2011, Labeaume announced that he was ""passing the puck"" to Pierre Karl Péladeau and the group Quebecor. The media empire engaged itself in using the new Colisée with or without an NHL team.

Personal life
In March 2019, Labeaume announced that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

"Manhasset, New York

Manhasset is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Nassau County, New York, on the North Shore of Long Island. As of the 2010 United States Census, the population was 8,080. As with other unincorporated communities in New York, its local affairs are administered by the town in which it is located, the Town of North Hempstead, New York, whose town hall is in Manhasset, making the hamlet the town seat.

Manhasset is a Native American term that translates to ""the island neighborhood"". In 2005, a Wall Street Journal article ranked Manhasset as the best town for raising a family in the New York metropolitan area. The Manhasset area, settled by 1680, grew quickly after it began being served by the Long Island Rail Road in 1898. The LIRR provides access to New York City via the Manhasset station with an approximately 40 minute commute to Penn Station. Express trains, which run during rush hour, make the trip in less than 30 minutes. The hamlet of Manhasset is located 19.5 miles (29.2 km) away from midtown Manhattan.

History

The Matinecock had a village on Manhasset Bay. These Native Americans called the area Sint Sink, meaning ""place of small stones."" They made wampum from oyster shells. In 1623, the area was claimed by the Dutch West India Company and they began forcing English settlers to leave in 1640. A 1643 land purchase made it possible for English settlers to return to Cow Neck (the peninsula where present-day Port Washington, Manhasset and surrounding villages are located.).

Manhasset Bay was previously known as Schout's Bay (a schout being roughly the Dutch equivalent of a sheriff), Martin Garretson's Bay (Martin Garretson was the Schout at one point), and later Cow Bay or Cow Harbor.  Cow Neck was so called because it offered good grazing land. By 1659, there were over 300 cows and 5 mi (8 km) fence separating Cow Neck from the areas south of it. The settlers came to an agreement that each of them could have one cow on the neck for each section of fence the individual had constructed. The area was more formally divided among the settlers when the fence was removed in 1677. Manhasset took on the name Little Cow Neck, Port Washington was known as Upper Cow Neck.

During the American Revolution, Little Cow Neck suffered at the hands of the British. Many structures and properties, such as the 1719 Quaker Meeting House were burned, seized or damaged. The Town of North Hempstead separated from the Town of Hempstead in 1784 because the South, inhabited mainly by Church of England people, was loyal to the king. The Northern communities and villages, dominated by Yankee Congregationalists supported independence.

In 1801 it cost 2 cents to travel between Roslyn and Spinney Hill on North Hempstead Turnpike, the newly opened toll road (now Northern Boulevard).

The Manhasset name was adopted in 1840 and comes from the native word ""Manhansett"", meaning ""island neighborhood."" Dairy farming was still a major endeavor but the oyster industry was also on the rise. In 1898, the Long Island Railroad arrived, bringing with it wealthy New Yorkers looking for country homes with easy transportation to more urban areas of New York City. Manhasset Valley and Spinney Hill attracted a number of skilled workers and immigrant families.

The North Hempstead Town Hall opened in Manhasset on Plandome Road in 1907. Town councilmen had previously been meeting in Roslyn taverns after North Hempstead split away from Hempstead in 1775.

The Manhasset Valley School, originally built to serve the children of the help on the local Gold Coast Estates, eventually came to serve Manhasset's African American community, and was closed in the 1960s by a desegregation lawsuit. It is still standing and is currently used as a community center. The centrally located but antiquated Plandome Road School was demolished in the early 1970s, having been replaced by the new Shelter Rock School by 1969. Currently, Mary Jane Davies Park sits on the site of the old school.

Geography
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which,  of it is land and  of it (1.24%) is water.

In addition to the unincorporated areas of Manhasset proper—North and South Strathmore, Strathmore Village, Strathmore Vanderbilt, Shorehaven, Terrace Manor, and Norgate—
those with a Manhasset address also include three incorporated villages: Munsey Park, Plandome, and Plandome Heights; and parts of three others: Flower Hill, Plandome Manor, and North Hills.

The Plandomes 
The three Plandomes—Plandome, Plandome Manor and Plandome Heights—are in the north. Incorporated in 1911, the Village of Plandome has frontage on Manhasset Bay, a village center with a village green, and the wooded hills area. Its c.1912 Village Hall, a local landmark at the Green, once served as an elementary school. Its own LIRR Station is no more than a mile away from each home in the village. Plandome Manor, incorporated in 1931, is a section of Manhasset with waterfront properties and parking at the railroad station. Plandome Heights, incorporated in 1929, has a history of Spanish architectural styles of white stucco exteriors and red-tile roofs, bordering downtown (unincorporated) Manhasset.

Munsey Park 
In 1922, Louis Sherry, the wealthy confectioner, sold his estate and mansion to newspaper publisher Frank A. Munsey. Over time, Munsey amassed  which included all of the present day Munsey Park. Munsey had no heirs, no family and his entire estate and assets were left to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. One portion of the Munsey lands—the Strathmore area and the chateau—was sold to Mrs. Graham Fair Vanderbilt. The  north were shaped into a model restricted community to reflect the generosity of Frank Munsey. The Metropolitan Museum developed a model community with all the homes built as authentic American colonial reproductions and the streets named for American artists.

The Strathmores and Vanderbilts 
After a decade of providing a gracious setting for lawn parties and social festivities, the Vanderbilt family sold the 100 acre property to architect William Levitt who developed the Strathmore Vanderbilt community centered around the presence of the French Chateau at the end of the long and winding tree-lined drive. Strathmore Vanderbilt is located south of Quaker Ridge Rd. and to the west of Chapel Rd. Those living in Strathmore Vanderbilt receive deeded membership shares to the Strathmore Vanderbilt Country Club. East of Mill Spring Rd, the residents of Strathmore Village do not receive deeded shares. South Strathmore is the area in front of Strathmore Vanderbilt and Strathmore Village. It runs from Northern Blvd. back to Quaker Ridge Rd. and Hilltop Dr. North Strathmore is between Northern Blvd. and Munsey Park, north of the early 21st century library, and runs east.

North Hills 
Once owned by John Hay Whitney, publisher of the New York Herald Tribune and Ambassador to England, the Whitney estate, known as Greentree, encompasses almost a quarter of the lands in Manhasset.

Shelter Rock is an 1800-ton granite boulder, the largest known on Long Island, deposited by a glacier more than 11,000 years ago near what is now Shelter Rock Road, in the Village of North Hills. The Matinecock Indians used its 30-foot overhang for shelter in their village on the site. Many legends woven by both Indians and colonists who arrived in the 1600s are still told. By the 1900s a dozen families owned huge estates, including business magnate Nicholas Frederic Brady, who built Inisfada, once one of the largest houses in the country.  In the past few decades, the area developed into several private gated communities surrounding Deepdale Golf Club, founded by William K. Vanderbilt II in 1924, using part of his Deepdale summer estate at Lake Success.

Flower Hill 
The name of Flower Hill can be traced to the early 18th century when the village consisted of several residences and other buildings located where today Port Washington Boulevard, Bonnie Heights Road and Country Club Drive intersect.  This was a village that served farmers whose land was located along Port Washington Boulevard and extended down to Hempstead Harbor.  Three of the original farmhouses in Flower Hill are still in existence: The Willets House, on the west side of Port Washington Boulevard, home of the Cow Neck Historical Society, The Williams House, also on the west side of Port Washington Boulevard and the Hewlett Homestead on the east side.  Proximity to the water was important because those farms shipped vegetables, grain and fruits to New York City from docks in Roslyn or Manhasset Bay.  In the spring many flowering cherry trees line the road to the farms with fields and meadows always filled with wild violets and other wildflowers. There are even some apple trees still standing that date to the days when Flower Hill farms sold the produce from their apple, pear and peach orchards. Sunset Hill, the historic estate of Albert and Alice Grace D'Oench and the Mason estate, both demolished, were also in Flower Hill, closer to the railroad line.

Greentree 

Approximately a quarter of Manhasset lands still belong to the private  Greentree Whitney estate. The family mansion and surrounding lands are among the few remaining largely intact Long Island ""Gold Coast"" estates. The Greentree Foundation occupies the property as a conference center dedicated to international justice and human rights issues.

Economy 

Manhasset is well known for its high-end premium open-air shopping center, the Americana Manhasset. The center is situated along Northern Boulevard's ""Miracle Mile"" which is referred to in Billy Joel's 1980 hit ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"". The Americana first opened in 1956 as a simple community-style shopping mall; however, in the early 2000s  gradually it catered to luxury goods boutiques such as Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers, Prada, Giorgio Armani, Chanel, Theory, Louis Vuitton, Hermès, and Burberry, among others. In addition, a short distance away from the Miracle Mile is Lord & Taylor, which was that brand's first branch store in America. In addition to Lord & Taylor, Manhasset has supported branches of some of the most well known stores in New York over the years—B. Altman and Company, Bonwit Teller, Abraham & Straus, Best & Co., Arnold Constable, Franklin Simon & Co., Peck & Peck, W. & J. Sloane, J.J. Newberry and Waldbaum's.

The old commercial center of Manhasset is situated around the railroad station on Plandome Road, where the LIRR connects directly into Manhattan for a 37-minute commute. The area has bakeries, pizzerias, delis, bars, coffee shops, and a movie theater. Centralized in town is a small park and a gazebo. The public library is located 1 block east of Plandome 
Road on the corner of Onderdonk Ave. and Northern Boulevard, next door to the historic Quaker Meeting House.

The North American headquarters of Sabena were located in a  office building in Manhasset. In April 2002 Knightsbridge Properties Corp. bought the building for $4.9 million. Due to the bankruptcies of Sabena and Swissair, the real estate deal took over a year to finish. During that month the building was 30% occupied. Sabena was scheduled to move out of the building on May 10, 2002. The buyer planned to spend an additional $2 million to convert the building into a multi-tenant, Class A office and medical facility.

The Manhasset School District covers not only the unincorporated areas discussed in the census reports, but several incorporated villages including Plandome, Plandome Manor, Munsey Park and part of Flower Hill.  Manhasset High School is rated among the top in the country. In the 2010 Newsweek magazine's annual list of the top American high schools, Manhasset is ranked 87th nationally out of the 1,700 schools evaluated.

Manhasset has a locally operated School Community Association (SCA) instead of electing to be a local chapter of the Parent Teacher Association. The SCA, which boasts great support within the community, annually hosts the SCA fair at Munsey Park School to raise money. Membership dues and profits from fund-raising efforts benefit the schools in Manhasset; no percentage of funds goes to a state or national offices of a larger organization, thus all monies raised benefit the Manhasset schools directly.

During the 2003–04 English football season, Sheffield Wednesday competed in the Football League Second Division.

Season summary
After relegation the previous season, Sheffield Wednesday competed in the third tier of English football for the first time in over 20 years. Wednesday made a positive start to the season and were 2nd in the league by mid-September. As results slipped through Autumn they slid down to mid table, although they remained around 6 points from the play off places going into the new year. An upturn in form never materialised and as the season wore on and promotion became less likely, results turned for the worse. Wednesday lost 9 of their last 13 league games finishing 16th, 20 points from a play off position and only avoiding relegation by 3 points.

"André Boillot

André Boillot (8 August 1891 – 5 June 1932) was a French auto racing driver. Born in Valentigney, Doubs, he was the younger brother of race car driver, Georges Boillot. Following in his brother's footsteps, André Boillot began racing cars at a young age. However, World War I not only disrupted his career but claimed the life of his brother in 1916.

After the war, André Boillot returned to racing as part of the Peugeot factory team and drove their EXS model to victory in the 1919 Targa Florio. French drivers had been a major force since the inception of the Indianapolis 500 in the United States and he was part of a large post-war contingent of entrants from France. Boillot competed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in the 1919 ""500"" and was in the thick of things when he crashed with only five laps remaining. He returned to race in the event in 1920 and 1921 but both times went out early with mechanical problems. In Europe, he won the 1922 and 1925 editions of the Coppa Florio and in 1926 he and co-pilot Louis Rigal won the Spa 24 Hours in Belgium.

André Boillot was driving a Peugeot 201 when he crashed during practice for the 1932 Ars hillclimbing race at La Châtre. He died in hospital a few days later from his injuries.

"Tag Challenge

The Tag Challenge is a social gaming competition, with a US$5,000 reward,  in which participants were invited to find five ""suspects"" in a simulated law enforcement search in five different cities throughout North America and Europe on March 31, 2012. It aimed to determine whether and how social media can be used to accomplish a realistic, time-sensitive, international law enforcement objective. The challenge was won by a team that located 3 of the 5 suspects.

Challenge description
The objective of the challenge was to be the first to locate and photograph five volunteer ""suspects"" in five different cities: Washington DC, New York City, London, Stockholm and Bratislava in Slovakia. At 8:00am local time, the organizers posted on their website a mug shot of each suspect on the day of the event. Each suspect wore a shirt bearing the event logo. The suspect’s face, dress, and the contest logo were clearly visible in each of the mug shots. Contestants used only this photograph and a brief description provided on the event website to identify each suspect. The photos would be verified through a unique code on both the front and back of the shirt, which was not revealed in a suspect’s mug shot but known only to the organizers. Participants had to make sure that the code phrase is clearly visible in each submission. The winning team or individual would receive up to US$5,000 in reward.

The challenge was created by an international group of graduate students from six countries, led by George Washington University graduate student J.R. deLara. The challenge is advertised as an ""independent, nonprofit event,"" but it is being sponsored by the US State Department and the US Embassy in Prague.

Role of Social Media
The scale of the challenge means that no single person or group of friends can tackle it on their own. Instead, winning was likely to rely on the ability to assemble a very large, ad hoc team of spotters. As such, the Tag Challenge is an example of crowdsourcing, an approach to accomplishing tasks by opening them to the public. It is similar to the DARPA Network Challenge, in which teams competed to locate 10 red weather balloons placed at random locations all over the United States. However, the Tag Challenge was expected to be significantly harder, due to the international distribution of the targets over so many countries and, more importantly, the fact that they were mobile.

Teams
Given the scale and geographical distribution of the challenge, the most likely winner was going to be a team rather than an individual.

 CrowdScanner: Organized by computer scientists from UCSD, Masdar Institute, and University of Southampton and led by Iyad Rahwan, this team included one of the winners of the DARPA Network Challenge. The strategy, based on the DARPA Network Challenge winning strategy, was as follows: 
""You receive $500 if you upload an image of a suspect that is accepted by the challenge organizers. If a friend you invited using your individualized referral link uploads an acceptable image of a suspect, YOU also get $100. Furthermore, recruiters of the first 2000 recruits who signed up by referral get $1 for each recruit they refer to sign up with us (using the individualized referral link).""

 TagTeam_: The Tag Teamgroup was run by a diverse group of individuals with backgrounds including international relations from the University of Chicago, statistics from Georgetown University, and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and George Washington University. Their strategy was to promise to distribute whatever winnings they receive to local charities, the individuals who locate the suspects, and those who provide a reference to a person to locates the suspects.

Outcome

The challenge took place on March 31, 2012. Entries were accepted until noon, 12:00 pm, EST on April 1, 2012. The organizers announced the winning team to be CrowdScanner, having located 3 among the 5 targets.

Analysis

The winning team subsequently published extensive analysis of the data from their social media campaign. It was found that during the challenge, people were ""able to consistently route information in a targeted fashion even under increasing time pressure."" Using a model of social-media fueled global mobilization, the authors estimated that during the most time-critical portion of the challenge, one in three social messages were geographically targeted. A blog on MIT Technology Review dubbed this ability ""12 hours of separation"" in homage to the Six degrees of separation theory.

"Symphony No. 6 (Shostakovich)

The Symphony No. 6 in B minor, Op. 54 by Dmitri Shostakovich was written in 1939, and first performed in Leningrad on 21 November 1939 by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Yevgeny Mravinsky.

Structure
Symphony No. 6 is in three movements and is approximately 30 minutes in length:

The Sixth Symphony is unusual in structure, beginning with a long and introspective slow movement, followed by two short movements: a scherzo and a ""full-blooded and debauched music-hall galop"".

According to music critic Herbert Glass, the ""entire [first] movement is based on the cell of a minor third, with a second theme - which follows without transition - the motif of a diminished seventh, with the trill at its close forming the third major ingredient of the movement - the two themes and the trill combined as a sort of super-theme. The composer lays this out as clearly as if he were teaching a music-appreciation class: do listen for it. Chamber music effects abound with, for instance, piccolo or flute, eerily alone or accompanied by the B-flat clarinets. There are walloping climaxes, too, each of which dies away into the gloom. Note, too, the composer's wonderful spotlighting of the melancholy English horn, a lone figure after the din has evaporated.""

The third movement galop is the movement Shostakovich himself thought was most successful. Music critic Daniel Hathaway noted that in the third movement, [the] ""Snare drums ratcheted up the riot of brutal sound in the Scherzo and references to the William Tell Overture and laughing trombones added a hilarious burlesque quality to the finale."" On average, the first movement is 15–20 minutes long, the second movement is 4–6 minutes long, and the third movement is 5–7 minutes long.

Instrumentation
This symphony is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes,  2 oboes, cor anglais, 3 clarinets (3rd doubling Eb clarinet), bass clarinet, 3 bassoons (3rd doubling contrabassoon), 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, tam-tam, xylophone, harp, celesta and strings.

History
The Sixth Symphony was originally planned to be a large-scale ""Lenin Symphony"" - a project which was often announced, but never materialised. Shostakovich had announced once in September 1938 that he was anxious to work on his Sixth Symphony, which would be a monumental composition for soloists, chorus and orchestra employing the poem Vladimir Ilyich Lenin by Vladimir Mayakovsky, but the declamatory nature of the poem made it difficult to set. He later tried to incorporate other literature about Lenin in his new symphony, but without success. In January 1939, he spoke about the Sixth Symphony in a radio address, with no mention of Lenin or any extramusical associations.

The purely instrumental Symphony No. 6 was completed in September 1939. Shostakovich commented on it in the press:

The musical character of the Sixth Symphony will differ from the mood and emotional tone of the Fifth Symphony, in which moments of tragedy and tension were characteristic. In my latest symphony, music of a contemplative and lyrical order predominates. I wanted to convey in it the moods of spring, joy, youth.

On 21 November 1939, exactly two years after the premiere of the Symphony No. 5, the premiere of the Symphony No. 6 took place in the Large Hall of the Leningrad Philharmonic in Leningrad by the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra under Yevgeny Mravinsky—the same location and performers. In the same programme was the Romantic Poem for violin and orchestra of Zhelobinsky. The symphony had a successful premiere, and the finale was encored. However, although a local critic lauded Shostakovich for further freeing himself from formalistic tendencies in his new symphony, the work was later criticised for its ungainly structure and the jarring juxtaposition of moods. The fact that the symphony was performed during a 10-day festival of Soviet music which included patriotic works by Prokofiev (excerpts from Alexander Nevsky) and Shaporin (On the Field of Kulikovo) probably did not help.

The first recording was made by Leopold Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra for RCA Victor in December 1940.

"The Crusades Through Arab Eyes

The Crusades Through Arab Eyes () is a French language historical essay by Lebanese author Amin Maalouf.

As the name suggests, the book is a narrative retelling of primary sources drawn from various Arab chronicles that seeks to provide an Arab perspective on the Crusades, and especially regarding the Crusaders – the Franks (Franj), as the Arabs called them – who are considered cruel, savage, ignorant and culturally backward.

From the first invasion in the eleventh century through till the general collapse of the Crusades in the thirteenth century, the book constructs a narrative that is the reverse of that common in the Western world, describing the main facts as bellicose and displaying situations of a quaint historic setting where Western Christians are viewed as ""barbarians"", unaware of the most elementary rules of honor, dignity and social ethics.

"Sandy railway station

Sandy railway station serves the town of Sandy in Bedfordshire, England. It is on the East Coast Main Line, about 44 miles (71 km) from . Sandy is managed and served by Great Northern.

Sandy station was originally built in 1850 for the Great Northern Railway; the London and North Western Railway opened an adjacent station in 1862. The stations were later merged into one, which has since undergone many changes.

The present station has two large platforms and 4 main rail lines, a pair of ""up and down"" slow lines used by stopping services and a pair of ""up and down"" fast lines used by high speed services passing through. A fifth line extends off the ""up"" slow line which links into the remaining sidings and original bay platforms. There is also a sixth line off the ""down"" slow line that links to a siding beside Platform1.

The station platforms have been lengthened at their southern ends so that they can cope with 12-car trains, which have recently started serving the station to increase capacity and in preparation for new Class 700 trains following the completion of the Thameslink Programme.

History

The first section of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) - that from  to a junction with the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway at Grimsby - opened on 1 March 1848, but the southern section of the main line, between  and , was not opened until August 1850. Sandy was one of the original stations, opening with the line on 7 August 1850.

The Sandy and Potton Railway was opened for goods traffic on 23 June 1857, and to passengers on 9 November 1857. It was later purchased by the Bedford and Cambridge Railway (B&CR), which closed the line in January 1862 for reconstruction. The line reopened on 7 July 1862, including a new station at Sandy separate from, but adjacent to, the GNR station. The B&CR was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1865. The eastern section of the Bedford-Cambridge route (sometimes known as the Varsity Line) closed on 1 January 1968, and with it, the ex-LNWR platforms at Sandy.

The two stations were physically adjacent, and shared an island platform. In 1917 the LNWR station was placed under the management of the GNR, and then shared the booking facilities. After the closure of the Varsity Line, the station was considerably rebuilt in the early 1970s to give a 4-track layout throughout, and platforms on the slow lines only, thus removing a 2-track bottleneck on the East Coast Main Line.

Sandy railway station was the site of the English unjust enrichment case Great Northern Railway Co. v Swaffield (1874) LR 9 Exch 132, in which the defendant sent a horse to this railway station, to be collected.  His employee arrived the next day, but the station master demanded that he pay livery stable costs for the night; the employee refused to pay, and did not collect the horse.  The defendant arrived later, and demanded payment to compensate him for duress of goods (after the station master offered to pay livery stable costs out of pocket); after the station master refused to pay such compensation, the defendant left the horse in the possession of the station for four months during litigation.  The Court of the Exchequer held the defendant liable for four months' stable costs, as the plaintiff in the case 'had not choice, unless they would leave the horse at the station or in the high road to his own danger and the danger of other people' (per Kelly CB).  In this way the court recognised a limited exception to the rule that no claim for salvage be recognised by the courts outside the context of salvage in tidal waters.  The stable costs were paid to the use of the defendant by way of necessity, and therefore constituted unjust enrichment.

Facilities

Sandy station has a small café inside the booking office on Platform 2. There is a large sheltered area with seating on Platform 1, and a smaller one on Platform 2. Both platforms have step-free access via the external road bridge. However the slope to the bridge is relatively steep on both sides of the railway and the footpath on the bridge is quite narrow.

In the later half of 2016, modern ticket barriers where installed at the entrance to both platforms along with a covered area to protect them from wind and rain damage. When in use, there are staff on hand if any issues arise.

The station has two modern touch screen ticket machines located in front of the booking office, and there are cycle storage facilities to the south of it. The station also has help points throughout, which were installed by former franchise holder First Capital Connect.

Services

The station is served by a half-hourly Thameslink service southbound to Horsham via London St Pancras and northbound to Peterborough. Late night southbound services terminate at London Kings Cross instead. There is an hourly service in each direction on Sundays.

Route

Future
In 2017, there was speculation that the station might be relocated from its current position in the town centre to a new site just to the north of the  town. In late January 2020, East West Rail Ltd announced that the route of EWR between  and  would be 'in the Tempsford area', mid way between Sandy and St Neots. Concern has been expressed locally that a new EWR/ECML interchange hub at Tempsford railway station may lead to the closure of Sandy station.

Location

In the chainage notation traditionally used on the railways, it is  from .

"Monika Bravo

Monika Bravo (born 1964) is a multi-disciplinary artist born in Bogotá, Colombia, who lives and works in New York City, New York. Her work has been internationally exhibited, including at Stenersen Museum in Oslo; Seoul's International Biennial of New Media Art; Bank of the Republic in Bogotá; New Museum and El Museo del Barrio in New York City and Site Santa Fe. Her work has received acclaim including a 1999 New York Times review which called her piece Synchronicity (from a group exhibition at El Museo del Barrio) a ""standout...small, beautifully blurry video images of boats plowing through New York Harbor...""

In 1982, Bravo left Bogotá, moving to Rome to study fashion design, which she continued in Paris at Esmod, before traveling to London to study photography. In 1994 she moved to New York where she is currently still based.

Career
Among Bravo's most well-known artworks is September 10, 2001, Uno Nunca Muere La Vispera dedicated to artist Michael Richards who died in Tower One on the morning of the September 11 attacks. In summer 2001 Bravo was an artist-in-residence in the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council's World Views program. As described in a 2006 book:

In 2010, Bravo was one of four winning artists in New York City's ""urbancanvas"" design competition with her work ""Breathing Wall UC"".

Most recently Bravo Represented the Vatican City in the Pavilion of the Holy See at the 56th International Art Exhibition of the Venice Biennial with her work ""ARCHE-TYPES: The sound of the word is beyond sense"".  With this new work, she continues with her interest in coding/decoding information, the interest in the language of abstraction and an ongoing pursuit to decipher reality by means of perception. She created a parallel between the prologue of the Gospel of John In the Beginning..., (given to her by the curator of the Pavilion, Micol Forti), Malevich’s ideas behind Suprematism* and the definition of Zaum by the avant garde Poet Aleksei Kruchenykh**.

Among her most recent exhibitions are Waterweavers curated by José Roca and Alejandro Martín, Art Museum of the Americas, Washington DC 2015, Centro Conde Duque, Madrid 2015 and Bard Graduate Center, New York 2014; Theorem.

"Grus pagei

Grus pagei is an extinct crane reported from the upper Pleistocene asphalt deposits of Rancho La Brea, Los Angeles, California. It is one of three cranes present at Rancho La Brea, the others being the living whooping crane (Grus americana) and sandhill crane (Grus canadensis). It is the smallest of the three cranes, and it had a relatively longer, more slender skull than the living cranes. At least 11 individuals are represented by 42 fossil bones. Described by Kenneth E. Campbell Jr. in 1995, it was named after the philanthropist responsible for the museum at the tar pits, George C. Page.

"Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge

The Institute of Astronomy (IoA) is the largest of the three astronomy departments in the University of Cambridge, and one of the largest astronomy sites in the UK. Around 180 academics, postdocs, visitors and assistant staff work at the department.

Research at the department is made in a number of scientific areas, including exoplanets, stars, star clusters, cosmology, gravitational-wave astronomy, the high-redshift universe, AGN, galaxies and galaxy clusters. This is a mixture of observational astronomy, over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, computational theoretical astronomy, and analytic theoretical research.

The Kavli Institute for Cosmology is also located on the department site. This Institute has an emphasis on The Universe at High Redshifts. The Cavendish Astrophysics Group are based in the Battcock Centre, a building in the same grounds.

History 

The Institute was formed in 1972 from the amalgamation of earlier institutions:
 The University Observatory, founded in 1823. Its Cambridge Observatory building now houses offices and the department library.
 The Solar Physics Observatory, which started in Cambridge in 1912. The building was partly demolished in 2008 to make way for the Kavli Institute for Cosmology.
 The Institute of Theoretical Astronomy, which was created by Fred Hoyle in 1967. Its building is the main departmental site (the Hoyle Building), with a lecture theatre added in 1999, and a second two-storey wing built in 2002.

From 1990 to 1998, the Royal Greenwich Observatory was based in Cambridge, where it occupied Greenwich House on a site adjacent to the Institute of Astronomy.

Teaching 
The department teaches 3rd and 4th year undergraduates as part of the Natural Sciences Tripos or Mathematical Tripos. Around 30 students normally study the Masters which consists of a substantial research project (around 1/3 of the Masters) and students have an opportunity to study courses such as General Relativity, Cosmology, Black Holes, Extrasolar Planets, Astrophysical Fluid Dynamics, Structure and Evolution of Stars & Formation of Galaxies. In addition, there are around 12 to 18 graduate PhD students at the department per year, mainly funded by the STFC. The graduate programme is particularly unusual in the UK as the students are free to choose their own PhD supervisor or adviser from the staff at the department, and this choice is often made as late as the end of their first term.

Telescopes 

The Institute houses several telescopes on its site. Although some scientific work is done with the telescopes, they are mostly used for public observing and astronomical societies. The poor weather and light-pollution in Cambridge makes most modern astronomy difficult. The telescopes on the site include:
 The Northumberland Telescope donated by the Duke of Northumberland in 1833. This is a  diameter refractor on an English mount.
 The smaller Thorrowgood Telescope, on extended loan from the Royal Astronomical Society. The telescope is an  refractor.
 The 36-inch Telescope, built in 1951.
 The Three-Mirror Telescope, which is a prototype telescope with a unique design to have wide field of view, sharp images and all-reflection optics.

The Institute's former 24"" Schmidt Camera was donated to the Spaceguard Centre in June 2009.

The Cambridge University Astronomical Society (CUAS) and Cambridge Astronomical Association (CAA) both regularly observe. The Institute holds public observing evenings on Wednesdays from October to March.

Public activities 

The department holds a number of events involving the general public in astronomy. These include/ have included:
 Open evenings on Wednesdays during the winter, from October to March, with a talk given by a member of the Institute followed by observing in clear weather 
 Hosting the Astroblast conference 
 Annual sculpture exhibition showing work of Anglia Ruskin University
 Annual open day during the Cambridge Science Festival
 A monthly podcast, the 'Astropod', aimed at the general public (last published episode July 2011)
 Extra observing nights for special events such as IYA Moonwatch and BBC stargazing live

Library 
The Institute library is housed in the old Cambridge Observatory building.  It is a specialist library concentrating on the subjects of astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology.  The collection has approximately 17,000 books and subscribes to about 80 current journals.  The Library also has a collection of rare astronomical books, many of which belonged to John Couch Adams.

Achievements 
Among the significant contributions to astronomy made by the institute, the now decommissioned Automatic Plate Measuring (APM) machine was used to create a major catalogue of astronomical objects in the northern sky.

"White Mountain School

The White Mountain School, often called White Mountain or WMS, is a co-educational, independent boarding school located in Bethlehem, New Hampshire, USA. Established in 1886 as St. Mary's School in Concord, New Hampshire, the school moved to its current location in 1936, situated just north of the White Mountains of New Hampshire.

History
The White Mountain School was founded in 1886 as an all-girls Episcopal high school called St. Mary's School in Concord, New Hampshire. In 1935, Dorothy McLane, the school's headmistress, moved the school north into the White Mountains region, to the estate of Ernest Poole in Sugar Hill, New Hampshire; the school was then renamed St. Mary's-in-the-Mountains.  One year later in 1936, the school bought the Seven Springs Estate, in Bethlehem, New Hampshire, from Eman and Mary Payne Beck and relocated there for the last time. Over the next 25 years, the Bethlehem campus expanded with the purchase of new dormitories and the construction of new classroom wings. On January 3, 1964, the school's Main Building burned down. The following year, a new Main Building was constructed in its place. Six years later, in 1970, the school began accepting a small number of male day students, and in 1972 the school became co-educational and changed its name to The White Mountain School.

Academics
The White Mountain School curriculum is structured in a traditional liberal arts model. Each discipline offers a range of courses from introductory-level, Honors, Advanced Placement, to student-designed independent studies. Year-long courses are worth one credit; semester courses are worth ½ credit. To graduate, students must earn 19 academic credits, including a minimum of 4 credits in English, 2 ½ credits in history, 3 credits in mathematics, 3 credits in science, 2 credits in world language, 1 credit in the arts, ½ credit in philosophy and religious studies and ½ credit in sustainability studies. (The White Mountain School was the first high school in the US to add Sustainability Studies as an academic department.) In addition, students must complete two Field Courses per year and a LASR Project.

The White Mountain School Field Course is a week-long, academic exploration of a specific topic that occurs within an appropriate geographic setting. They occur in October and March for five days in length. Recent courses have included Poverty, Homelessness and Hunger (Portland, Maine), Adirondack Art and Adventure (New York), Island Culture and Ecology (Acadia National Park, Maine), Avalanche Forecasting (Wyoming & Idaho), A Walk in Thoreau's Shoes (Massachusetts), Gender & Politics: Women's Rights in the US (Washington, DC), Desert Ecology of the Southwest (Tucson, Arizona), Community Service Odyssesy (Dominican Republic), Writing for Performance: Exploration of Performing Arts (New Hampshire), Buddhism (The Vermont Zen Center, Shelburne, Vermont), Green Living in the Urban World: Sustainability & Service (Montreal), Carving Up Equations to Carve the Slopes: The Math of Ski and Snowboard Design (Vermont & New Hampshire).

""LASR"" in the White Mountain School LASR Project stands for the general categories that students can pursue: Leadership, Arts, Service and Research. Students choose from several approaches to completing the project, including (but not limited to) the following courses: Research Seminar, Art Portfolio, Independent Study, Senior Project, and Field Course Leadership.

Faculty and advisors
Every student has a faculty advisor who communicates with parents throughout the year and they serve as a primary liaison between student, family, and teacher. 67% of the faculty hold advanced degrees as well as a variety of additional certifications.

College matriculation
Recent WMS graduates have attended colleges and universities that include American University, Boston University, Colby College, Connecticut College, Davidson College, Drexel University, Duke University, Mount Holyoke College, New York University, Tufts University, the University of Michigan, the University of New Hampshire, and Wesleyan University.

Student body
The White Mountain School enrolls 123 students from around the country and the world, 49% male and 51% female. 76% of the student population boards and 24% are day students from surrounding towns.

Campus

The school's  campus is located between the towns of Bethlehem and Littleton, New Hampshire on a hilltop providing views of the White Mountains. The McLane Academic Center houses the classroom wing, multimedia center and learning labs. The school library offers more than 7,000 volumes, an online catalog, several online databases, and an inter-library loan system with Dartmouth College and the University of New Hampshire. The Fred Steele Science Center is equipped with SMART Board interactive technology and state-of-the-art labs which allow for a wide range of independent projects. The new Catherine Houghton Arts Center houses dance, visual arts, and music studios. The school partners with Creative Edge Dance Studio to offer academic courses as well as technique and performance-based classes for students of all dance styles and levels. Students have access to these spaces and the practice studios and recording lab outside of class.

The  indoor Beverly S. Buder climbing wall is located inside an indoor sports center outfitted with Nautilus equipment, free weights and aerobic equipment. The campus also has two athletic fields, an extensive trail system, and a school farm, including a student-built post and beam shed; a chicken coop with hens; an organic vegetable and fruit garden; and composting bins. The student center is located in McLane.

Boarding students live in one of four dorms with their peers, faculty members and faculty families. Each dorm has common space with couches, a TV and a microwave. The dining hall serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and is available for drinks and light snacks all day.

On weekends, faculty offer a range of activities for students. Activities include outdoor outings such as moonlight hikes, ski trips or mountain bike riding; shopping trips to outlet centers, Burlington, or the local towns; art excursions to movies, plays, and art exhibits; campus sponsored cultural events, cookie baking in faculty kitchens and games.

"Missing Person (novel)

Missing Person (French: Rue des Boutiques Obscures) is the sixth novel by French writer Patrick Modiano, published on 5 September 1978. In the same year it was awarded the Prix Goncourt. The English translation by Daniel Weissbort was published in 1980. Rue des Boutiques Obscures (literally 'the Street of dark shops') is the name of a street in Rome (La Via delle Botteghe Oscure) where one of the characters lived, and where Modiano himself lived for some time.

On 9 October 2014, Patrick Modiano was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

Plot summary
Guy Roland is an amnesiac detective who lost his memory ten years before the beginning of the story, which opens in 1965.  When his employer, Hutte, retires and closes the detective agency where he has worked for eight years, Roland embarks on a search for his own identity. His investigations uncover clues to a life that seems to stop during the Second World War. It seems that he is Jimmy Pedro Stern, a Greek Jew from Salonica, who was living in Paris under an assumed name, Pedro McEvoy, and working for the legation of the Dominican Republic. He and several friends (Denise Coudreuse, a French model who shares his life; Freddie Howard Luz, a British citizen originally from Mauritius; Gay Orlov, an American dancer of Russian origin; and André Wildmer, an English former jockey, all of whom are enemy nationals) went to  Megève to escape a Paris that had become dangerous for them during the German occupation. Denise and Pedro attempted to flee to  Switzerland, and paid a smuggler who abandoned them in the mountains, separating them and leaving them lost in the snow.

Having partially recovered his memory, Guy Roland goes to look for Freddie, who went to live in Polynesia after the war. When he arrives in Bora Bora, he learns that Freddie has disappeared, either lost at sea or by choice. At the end of the novel he is about to follow the last clue that remains to his past: an address in the Via della Botteghe Obscure in Rome, where Jimmy Pedro Stern is recorded as having lived in the 1930s.

"Nuclear medicine

Nuclear medicine is a medical specialty involving the application of radioactive substances in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Nuclear medicine imaging, in a sense, is ""radiology done inside out"" or ""endoradiology"" because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than radiation that is generated by external sources like X-rays. In addition, nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy but the function and for such reason, it is called a physiological imaging modality. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine.

Diagnostic medical imaging

Diagnostic
In nuclear medicine imaging, radiopharmaceuticals are taken internally, for example, intravenously or orally. Then, external detectors (gamma cameras) capture and form images from the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceuticals. This process is unlike a diagnostic X-ray, where external radiation is passed through the body to form an image.

There are several techniques of diagnostic nuclear medicine. 
 2D: Scintigraphy (""scint"") is the use of internal radionuclides to create two-dimensional images.

 3D: SPECT is a 3D tomographic technique that uses gamma camera data from many projections and can be reconstructed in different planes. Positron emission tomography (PET) uses coincidence detection to image functional processes.

Nuclear medicine tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that diagnostic tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to traditional anatomical imaging such as CT or MRI. Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, head CT scan, etc.). In addition, there are nuclear medicine studies that allow imaging of the whole body based on certain cellular receptors or functions. Examples are whole body PET scans or PET/CT scans, gallium scans, indium white blood cell scans, MIBG and octreotide scans.

While the ability of nuclear metabolism to image disease processes from differences in metabolism is unsurpassed, it is not unique. Certain techniques such as fMRI image tissues (particularly cerebral tissues) by blood flow and thus show metabolism. Also, contrast-enhancement techniques in both CT and MRI show regions of tissue that are handling pharmaceuticals differently, due to an inflammatory process.

Diagnostic tests in nuclear medicine exploit the way that the body handles substances differently when there is disease or pathology present. The radionuclide introduced into the body is often chemically bound to a complex that acts characteristically within the body; this is commonly known as a tracer. In the presence of disease, a tracer will often be distributed around the body and/or processed differently. For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching technetium-99m to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as due to a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer. This often results in the appearance of a ""hot spot"", which is a focal increase in radio accumulation or a general increase in radio accumulation throughout the physiological system. Some disease processes result in the exclusion of a tracer, resulting in the appearance of a ""cold spot"". Many tracer complexes have been developed to image or treat many different organs, glands, and physiological processes.

Hybrid scanning techniques 
In some centers, the nuclear medicine scans can be superimposed, using software or hybrid cameras, on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight the part of the body in which the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated. This practice is often referred to as image fusion or co-registration, for example SPECT/CT and PET/CT. The fusion imaging technique in nuclear medicine provides information about the anatomy and function, which would otherwise be unavailable or would require a more invasive procedure or surgery.

Practical concerns in nuclear imaging 

Although the risks of low-level radiation exposures are not well understood, a cautious approach has been universally adopted that all human radiation exposures should be kept As Low As Reasonably Practicable, ""ALARP"". (Originally, this was known as ""As Low As Reasonably Achievable"" (ALARA), but this has changed in modern draftings of the legislation to add more emphasis on the ""Reasonably"" and less on the ""Achievable"".)

Working with the ALARP principle, before a patient is exposed for a nuclear medicine examination, the benefit of the examination must be identified. This needs to take into account the particular circumstances of the patient in question, where appropriate. For instance, if a patient is unlikely to be able to tolerate a sufficient amount of the procedure to achieve a diagnosis, then it would be inappropriate to proceed with injecting the patient with the radioactive tracer.

When the benefit does justify the procedure, then the radiation exposure (the amount of radiation given to the patient) should also be kept as low as reasonably practicable. This means that the images produced in nuclear medicine should never be better than required for confident diagnosis. Giving larger radiation exposures can reduce the noise in an image and make it more photographically appealing, but if the clinical question can be answered without this level of detail, then this is inappropriate.

As a result, the radiation dose from nuclear medicine imaging varies greatly depending on the type of study. The effective radiation dose can be lower than or comparable to or can far exceed the general day-to-day environmental annual background radiation dose. Likewise, it can also be less than, in the range of, or higher than the radiation dose from an abdomen/pelvis CT scan.

Some nuclear medicine procedures require special patient preparation before the study to obtain the most accurate result. Pre-imaging preparations may include dietary preparation or the withholding of certain medications. Patients are encouraged to consult with the nuclear medicine department prior to a scan.

Analysis 

The end result of the nuclear medicine imaging process is a ""dataset"" comprising one or more images. In multi-image datasets the array of images may represent a time sequence (i.e. cine or movie) often called a ""dynamic"" dataset, a cardiac gated time sequence, or a spatial sequence where the gamma-camera is moved relative to the patient. SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) is the process by which images acquired from a rotating gamma-camera are reconstructed to produce an image of a ""slice"" through the patient at a particular position. A collection of parallel slices form a slice-stack, a three-dimensional representation of the distribution of radionuclide in the patient.

The nuclear medicine computer may require millions of lines of source code to provide quantitative analysis packages for each of the specific imaging techniques available in nuclear medicine.

Time sequences can be further analysed using kinetic models such as multi-compartment models or a Patlak plot.

Interventional nuclear medicine

Radionuclide therapy can be used to treat conditions such as hyperthyroidism, thyroid cancer, and blood disorders.

In nuclear medicine therapy, the radiation treatment dose is administered internally (e.g. intravenous or oral routes) rather than from an external radiation source.

The radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine therapy emit ionizing radiation that travels only a short distance, thereby minimizing unwanted side effects and damage to noninvolved organs or nearby structures. Most nuclear medicine therapies can be performed as outpatient procedures since there are few side effects from the treatment and the radiation exposure to the general public can be kept within a safe limit.

Common nuclear medicine (unsealed source) therapies

In some centers the nuclear medicine department may also use implanted capsules of isotopes (brachytherapy) to treat cancer.

Commonly used radiation sources (radionuclides) for brachytherapy

History 

The history of nuclear medicine contains contributions from scientists across different disciplines in physics, chemistry, engineering, and medicine. The multidisciplinary nature of nuclear medicine makes it difficult for medical historians to determine the birthdate of nuclear medicine. This can probably be best placed between the discovery of artificial radioactivity in 1934 and the production of radionuclides by Oak Ridge National Laboratory for medicine related use, in 1946.

The origins of this medical idea date back as far as the mid-1920s in Freiburg, Germany, when George de Hevesy made experiments with radionuclides administered to rats, thus displaying metabolic pathways of these substances and establishing the tracer principle. Possibly, the genesis of this medical field took place in 1936, when John Lawrence, known as ""the father of nuclear medicine"", took a leave of absence from his faculty position at Yale Medical School, to visit his brother Ernest Lawrence at his new radiation laboratory (now known as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) in Berkeley, California. Later on, John Lawrence made the first application in patients of an artificial radionuclide when he used phosphorus-32 to treat leukemia.
 
Many historians consider the discovery of artificially produced radionuclides by Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Irène Joliot-Curie in 1934 as the most significant milestone in nuclear medicine. In February 1934, they reported the first artificial production of radioactive material in the journal Nature, after discovering radioactivity in aluminum foil that was irradiated with a polonium preparation. Their work built upon earlier discoveries by Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen for X-ray, Henri Becquerel for radioactive uranium salts, and Marie Curie (mother of Irène Curie) for radioactive thorium, polonium and coining the term ""radioactivity."" Taro Takemi studied the application of nuclear physics to medicine in the 1930s. The history of nuclear medicine will not be complete without mentioning these early pioneers.
 
Nuclear medicine gained public recognition as a potential specialty when on May 11,1946 an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Massachusetts General Hospital's Dr. Saul Hertz and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dr.Arthur Roberts, described the successful use of treating Graves' Disease with radioactive iodine (RAI) was published. Additionally, Sam Seidlin. brought further development in the field describing a successful treatment of a patient with thyroid cancer metastases using radioiodine (I-131). These articles are considered by many historians as the most important articles ever published in nuclear medicine. Although the earliest use of I-131 was devoted to therapy of thyroid cancer, its use was later expanded to include imaging of the thyroid gland, quantification of the thyroid function, and therapy for hyperthyroidism. Among the many radionuclides that were discovered for medical-use, none were as important as the discovery and development of Technetium-99m. It was first discovered in 1937 by C. Perrier and E. Segre as an artificial element to fill space number 43 in the Periodic Table. The development of a generator system to produce Technetium-99m in the 1960s became a practical method for medical use. Today, Technetium-99m is the most utilized element in nuclear medicine and is employed in a wide variety of nuclear medicine imaging studies.
 
Widespread clinical use of nuclear medicine began in the early 1950s, as knowledge expanded about radionuclides, detection of radioactivity, and using certain radionuclides to trace biochemical processes. Pioneering works by Benedict Cassen in developing the first rectilinear scanner and Hal O. Anger's scintillation camera (Anger camera) broadened the young discipline of nuclear medicine into a full-fledged medical imaging specialty.

By the early 1960s, in southern Scandinavia, Niels A. Lassen, David H. Ingvar, and Erik Skinhøj developed techniques that provided the first blood flow maps of the brain, which initially involved xenon-133 inhalation; an intra-arterial equivalent was developed soon after, enabling measurement of the local distribution of cerebral activity for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. Later versions would have 254 scintillators so a two-dimensional image could be produced on a color monitor. It allowed them to construct images reflecting brain activation from speaking, reading, visual or auditory perception and voluntary movement. The technique was also used to investigate, e.g., imagined sequential movements, mental calculation and mental spatial navigation.
 
By the 1970s most organs of the body could be visualized using nuclear medicine procedures. In 1971, American Medical Association officially recognized nuclear medicine as a medical specialty. In 1972, the American Board of Nuclear Medicine was established, and in 1974, the American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine was established, cementing nuclear medicine as a stand-alone medical specialty.
 
In the 1980s, radiopharmaceuticals were designed for use in diagnosis of heart disease. The development of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), around the same time, led to three-dimensional reconstruction of the heart and establishment of the field of nuclear cardiology.

More recent developments in nuclear medicine include the invention of the first positron emission tomography scanner (PET). The concept of emission and transmission tomography, later developed into single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), was introduced by David E. Kuhl and Roy Edwards in the late 1950s. Their work led to the design and construction of several tomographic instruments at the University of Pennsylvania. Tomographic imaging techniques were further developed at the Washington University School of Medicine. These innovations led to fusion imaging with SPECT and CT by Bruce Hasegawa from University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and the first PET/CT prototype by D. W. Townsend from University of Pittsburgh in 1998.

PET and PET/CT imaging experienced slower growth in its early years owing to the cost of the modality and the requirement for an on-site or nearby cyclotron. However, an administrative decision to approve medical reimbursement of limited PET and PET/CT applications in oncology has led to phenomenal growth and widespread acceptance over the last few years, which also was facilitated by establishing 18F-labelled tracers for standard procedures, allowing work at non-cyclotron-equipped sites. PET/CT imaging is now an integral part of oncology for diagnosis, staging and treatment monitoring. A fully integrated MRI/PET scanner is on the market from early 2011.

Sources of radionuclides 

99mTc is normally supplied to hospitals through a radionuclide generator containing the parent radionuclide molybdenum-99. 99Mo is typically obtained as a fission product of 235U in nuclear reactors, however global supply shortages have lead to the exploration of other methods of production. About a third of the world's supply, and most of Europe's supply, of medical isotopes is produced at the Petten nuclear reactor in the Netherlands. Another third of the world's supply, and most of North America's supply, was produced at the Chalk River Laboratories in Chalk River, Ontario, Canada until its permanent shutdown in 2018.

The most commonly used radioisotope in PET 18F, is not produced in any nuclear reactor, but rather in a circular accelerator called a cyclotron. The cyclotron is used to accelerate protons to bombard the stable heavy isotope of oxygen 18O. The 18O constitutes about 0.20% of ordinary oxygen (mostly O-16), from which it is extracted. The F-18 is then typically used to make FDG.

A typical nuclear medicine study involves administration of a radionuclide into the body by intravenous injection in liquid or aggregate form, ingestion while combined with food, inhalation as a gas or aerosol, or rarely, injection of a radionuclide that has undergone micro-encapsulation. Some studies require the labeling of a patient's own blood cells with a radionuclide (leukocyte scintigraphy and red blood cell scintigraphy). Most diagnostic radionuclides emit gamma rays either directly from their decay or indirectly through electron-positron annihilation, while the cell-damaging properties of beta particles are used in therapeutic applications. Refined radionuclides for use in nuclear medicine are derived from fission or fusion processes in nuclear reactors, which produce radionuclides with longer half-lives, or cyclotrons, which produce radionuclides with shorter half-lives, or take advantage of natural decay processes in dedicated generators, i.e. molybdenum/technetium or strontium/rubidium.

The most commonly used intravenous radionuclides are Technetium-99m (technetium-99m), Iodine-123 and 131, Thallium-201, Gallium-67, Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, and Indium-111 Labeled Leukocytes. The most commonly used gaseous/aerosol radionuclides are xenon-133, krypton-81m, (aerosolised) technetium-99m.

Radiation dose
A patient undergoing a nuclear medicine procedure will receive a radiation dose. Under present international guidelines it is assumed that any radiation dose, however small, presents a risk. The radiation dose delivered to a patient in a nuclear medicine investigation, though unproven, is generally accepted to present a very small risk of inducing cancer. In this respect it is similar to the risk from X-ray investigations except that the dose is delivered internally rather than from an external source such as an X-ray machine, and dosage amounts are typically significantly higher than those of X-rays.

The radiation dose from a nuclear medicine investigation is expressed as an effective dose with units of sieverts (usually given in millisieverts, mSv). The effective dose resulting from an investigation is influenced by the amount of radioactivity administered in megabecquerels (MBq), the physical properties of the radiopharmaceutical used, its distribution in the body and its rate of clearance from the body.

Effective doses can range from 6 μSv (0.006 mSv) for a 3 MBq chromium-51 EDTA measurement of glomerular filtration rate to 37 mSv (37,000 μSv) for a 150 MBq thallium-201 non-specific tumour imaging procedure. The common bone scan with 600 MBq of technetium-99m-MDP has an effective dose of approximately 3.5 mSv (3,500 μSv) (1).

Formerly, units of measurement were the curie (Ci), being 3.7E10 Bq, and also 1.0 grams of Radium (Ra-226); the rad (radiation absorbed dose), now replaced by the gray; and the rem (Röntgen equivalent man), now replaced with the sievert. The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only alpha radiation will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE). Alpha emitters are nowadays rarely used in nuclear medicine, but were used extensively before the advent of nuclear reactor and accelerator produced radionuclides. The concepts involved in radiation exposure to humans are covered by the field of Health Physics; the development and practice of safe and effective nuclear medicinal techniques is a key focus of Medical Physics.

"ISO/IEC 9995

ISO/IEC 9995 Information technology — Keyboard layouts for text and office systems is an ISO standard series defining layout principles for computer keyboards. It does not define specific layouts but provides the base for national and industry standards which define such layouts.

The project of this standard was adopted at ISO in Berlin in 1985 under the proposition of Dr Yves Neuville. The ISO/IEC 9995 standard series dates to 1994 and has undergone several updates over the years.

 ISO/IEC 9995-11:2015 Functionality of dead keys and repertoires of characters entered by dead keys

(ISO 9995-6:2006 Function section was withdrawn 2009-10-08.)

ISO/IEC 9995-1 

ISO/IEC 9995-1 provides a fundamental description of keyboards suitable for text and office systems, and defines several terms which are used throughout the ISO/IEC 9995 standard series.

Physical division and reference grid 

The figure shows the division of a keyboard into sections, which are subdivided into zones.
 alphanumeric section
 alphanumeric zone (indicated by green coloring)
 function zones (indicated by blue coloring)
 numeric section
 numeric zone (indicated by darker red coloring)
 function zone (indicated by lighter red coloring)
 editing and function section (in fact covering all parts of the keyboard which do not belong to the alphanumeric or numeric section)
 cursor key zone (indicated by darker grey coloring)
 editing function zone (indicated by lighter grey coloring)
The presence of a numeric section is not required by the standard. Also, the standard does not prevent a numeric section to be placed left of the alphanumeric section.

By means of the reference grid, each key can be identified by a unique combination of a letter (indicating the row) and a sequence of two digits (indicating the column). E.g., the key containing the digit one on several layouts is identified as “Key E01”. The labeling rules do allow for function keys to be arranged other than above of the alphanumeric section, or to be arranged in more than one row (thus, e.g. an AT keyboard is compliant to the standard):
 Columns containing editing or function keys are to be numbered from 60 on when placed beyond a right numeric section, or from 80 downwards when placed left of the alphanumeric section.
 Rows above of the alphanumeric section are to be labeled from K on, and rows below the space key are to be labeled from Z downwards.
The grid may be angled (as shown in the figure within the alphanumeric section), or squared (thus, keyboards where the alphanumeric keys are ordered in pure vertical columns are compliant to the standard).

The standard does not constrain the numbers of rows and columns in the alphanumeric section.

Levels and groups 

The selection of level and group during the input of a character (e.g. by means of a shift key, an AltGr key, or a group selection key or key sequence) is specified in ISO/IEC 9995-2.

Levels (“unshifted” “shifted”, “AltGr”) 

The characters which can be input by the keys in the alphanumeric section usually are organized in levels. For two-cased scripts like Latin, the basic level (“Level 1”) contains lower-case letters, while the “Level 2” contains capital letters (therefore, these levels are usually called “unshifted” and “shifted”). For characters which are not letters (like punctuation marks), no rules are given regarding their distribution among the levels. While digits are commonly in Level 1, there are exceptions (e.g. the French keyboard layout).
 
The standard allows for a third level (but not for more than three levels). Usually (but not mandatory by the standard), characters in such a level are selected by the means of an AltGr key.

Groups 
If the organization into three levels is not sufficient to accommodate all characters to be contained in a specific layout, then “groups” may be defined which then constitute a higher hierarchical unit than levels. Thus, each such group usually is subdivided into (up to three) levels. Common examples are layouts allowing the input of characters of different scripts, like e.g. the Japanese keyboard layout (where the kana constitute the second group). Other examples are recent standardizations which allow the input of considerably more characters than their preceding editions (to overcome the historic limits of mechanical typewriters), like the Canadian Québec layout or the recently (2012) standardized German T2 layout.

“Group selectors” are defined in ISO/IEC 9995-2. On the US-International layout, the group selector for the second group is the AltGr key; on some others the simultaneously pressed Shift and AltGr keys. (At some time in the past,  the two groups were sometimes called  third level and fourth level contrary to the terminology defined in ISO/IEC 9995.)

Depictions on the keytops 
According to ISO/IEC 9995-1, the level is indicated by the row where the character is depicted on the keytop:
 Level 2 (“shifted”) above of Level 1 (“unshifted”)
 Level 3 (“AltGr”) below Level 1 (“unshifted”).
The group is indicated by the column on the keytop:
 The first or “primary group” at the left keytop border
 The second or “secondary group” at the right keytop border
 Additional groups (if existing) in between.
When letters on a case pair are associated with a key, only the capital character need to be shown on the keytop for the primary group, while the lowercase character only is shown for the secondary group.

Thus, on the depicted key of the German T2 layout, in the primary group are the characters “#” in Level 1 (unshifted), “'” in Level 2 (shifted), and “®” in Level 3 (accessed by the AltGr key). In the secondary group, there is the lowercase letter “ə” in Level 1 (unshifted) and its capital counterpart “Ə” in Level 2 (shifted).

For layouts containing only one group, characters in Level 3 may be depicted in the lower right corner of a keytop, to allow larger depictions for ergonomic reasons. For instance, on the depicted key of the German T1 layout, the “\” is in Level 3 (of the only defined group), to be accessed by the AltGr key.

Special issues

ISO/IEC 9995-2 

ISO/IEC 9995-2 specifies requirements for the keys contained in the alphanumeric section (see the description of ISO/IEC 9995-1 above).

The alphanumeric zone (being a part of the alphanumeric section) has to contain 47 or more keys used to input characters, including the Space bar which has to be placed in the lowest row (row A according to the reference grid specified in ISO/IEC 9995-1). Also, there must be:
 at least 12 keys in row E (the upmost row) in positions E00 to E15, containing all keys to input the decimal digits,
 at least 12 keys in row D in positions D01 to D15,
 at least 11 keys in row C in positions C01 to C15,
 at least 10 keys in row B in positions B00 to B11.

The space bar has to expand at least over the positions A03 to A07. This implies that Japanese keyboards containing muhenkan, henkan, and the Katakana/Hiragana switch keys (the first one left, the other two right of the space bar) are not compliant to the standard if taken literally. This, however, is considered neglectable as the space bar has less importance in Japanese writing than in Latin or similar ones, as Japanese words usually are not separated by spaces.

Layouts which are designed for the Latin script must contain at least the 26 basic letters A…Z and a…z, the decimal digits 0…9, and the following characters contained in ISO 646: ! "" % & ' * ( ) + , - . / : ; < = > ? _ and space.

Alphanumeric section of a keyboard, showing several details specified in ISO/IEC 9995-2:2009 (including the possibilities of numeric keypad emulation specified in amendment 1 of 2012)

The keys shown grey in the figure, all being function keys, constitute the left and right function zones, while all other keys constitute the alphanumeric zone. The reference grid position of any function key may vary according to the specifications listed below. Especially, on a keyboard with considerably more than 47 keys in the alphanumeric zone, the right function keys will get higher column numbers.

The symbols shown for the function keys are specified in ISO/IEC 9995-7. Letterings which are commonly used instead of the symbols are shown in their English version in parentheses.

The harmonized 48 graphic key keyboard arrangement 

Keyboards which comply to this narrower specification contain all the keys shown in white in the figure above, the key at C12 shown in yellow, and one of the two keys at E13 and B00 shown in red. The standard does not require this; it only says that keyboards complying to this narrower specification can be called such.

A key at E00 is not required, but when it is present on the keyboard, the positions E13 and B00 (shown in red) may have no key (e. g. the US layout with the Backspace or Delete key at E14 enlarged to E13 and the left Shift key at B99 enlarged to B00); but most international layouts having a key at E00 also have at least one key on E13 (with a narrow Backspace or Delete key on row E at E14, but a left Shift key at B99 enlarged to B00) or B00 (with a narrow left Shift key at B99, but a Backspace or Delete key at E14 enlarged to E13). Key at E00 may also be used to allocate a function key (notably the Escape key on compact keyboards), in which case a key will generally be present at E13 (on compact US layout), or B00, or both (on compact international layouts). Finally the key at E00 may also be used to place the digit 0 at start of the row instead of the more common location at E10, in which case there two positions E13 and B00 may be used to enlarge both the Backspace or Delete key at E14 to E13 and the left Shift Key at B99 to B00).

In fact, several layouts (e. g. the US layout), to allow a wider return key, have a key at D13 (shown in green) instead of C12 (shown in yellow). Thus, while they cannot be called “harmonized 48 graphic key keyboards” according to the standard, they still comply to the standard itself. ISO/IEC 9995-3:2010, in referring to the basic layout within its specific scope, does take a possible substitution of C12 by D13 into account.

Function keys 

A tabulation key shall be present, occupying position D00 (i. e., the key may be wider, spanning over additional positions like D99 left of D00).

A key providing one of the functions Capitals lock (usually called “Caps Lock”), Level 2 lock (i. e. “Shift lock”), or Generalized lock shall be present, occupying the position C00. (The function “Generalized lock” is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series). The specific way the Caps Lock or Shift Lock works (i. e. swapping the lock state by hitting the key, as it is usually implemented) is not specified in the ISO/IEC 9995 series. Thus, solutions avoiding the status dependency as well as the problem of inadvertent hitting (e.g., the lock key pressed together with Shift turns Shift lock on, together with AltGr turns Caps Lock on, pressed alone switches off any lock status but has no effect when no lock status is activated) would not prevent compliance to the standard.

A Return key has to be present, right of the character input keys in row C. It is recommended that it expands to row D (thus spanning over position D13 when located on position C13 as shown in the figure), as it e. g. does on the German layout.

A key providing one of the functions Backspace or Backward erase shall be present in row A or (as it is more common) Row E, right of the character input keys.

If at least one Alternate key (commonly called “Alt key”) is present, it is to be positioned left of the space bar (or, if a function key specific to the writing system supported by the keyboard layout is there, left of that key).

If at least one Control key (commonly abbreviated “Ctrl”) is present, it has to be placed leftmost in row A (as it is more common), or row B.

If a Function key (commonly abbreviated “Fn”) is present, it is to be positioned left the space bar and left of an “Alternate” key, if such one is present. (It is allowed but explicitly not recommended to place the “Function” key left of the “Control” key.)

Level and group selection 

To select the Level 2 (commonly called “shifted”, see the subsection “Levels and Groups” of the section “ISO/IEC 9995-1” above), two keys shall be present in row B (commonly called Shift keys). The left one shall occupy position B99, while the right one shall be located right of the character input keys of that row. The exact function of these keys (commonly pressing them together with the affected character input key) is not specified in the standard. Thus, solutions where the shift key is pressed, then released before the character input key is pressed, are compliant with the standard.

To select the Level 3 (if this is present on a layout), at least one Level 3 select key (frequently marked AltGr) shall be present. On keyboards compliant to the “harmonized 48 graphic key keyboard arrangement” (see above), such keys shall be placed in row A or row B. Like for the shift keys, the exact function of these keys (commonly pressing them together with the affected character input key) is not specified in the standard.

For layouts containing more than one group, several mechanisms for group selection are specified. A dedicated Group selection key (marked by  according to ISO/IEC 9995-7), if present, shall be positioned adjacent to a “Level 3 select” (AltGr) key. For layouts containing a “Group 2” as specified in ISO/IEC 9995-3, this key shall work as a “latch” (i. e., when it is pressed and then released, the actuation of the next character input key causes the selection of a character of Group 2. After this, the status is reverted, thus subsequent character input key actuations refer to the basic group unless the “group selection” key is actuated again). If no dedicated “Group selection” key is present, its function is obtained by pressing the “Level 2 select” and “Level 3 select” (i. e. “Shift” and “AltGr”) key simultaneously and releasing them before actuating the selected character input key.

Allocation guidelines for layouts containing the Latin alphabet 

An informative annex “Allocation guidelines” provides a basic pattern for arrangements of Latin letters, which in fact specifies a foundation for the kinds of keyboard layouts known as QWERTY, QWERTZ, or AZERTY. As this annex is not normative, it does not prevent other arrangements like the Dvorak keyboard or the Turkish F-keyboard being compliant to the ISO/IEC 9995 standard series.

The figure shows letters in black where a unique position is given, while the letters shown in red may alternatively occupy any of the positions where they are shown. Digits may be allocated on Level 0 (unshifted) or Level 1 (shifted). An asterisk indicates “any other character”.

Numeric keypad emulation 

The amendment 1 of ISO/IEC 9995-2:2009, which was published in 2012, specifies two ways of the emulation of a numeric keypad within the alphanumeric section of a keyboard. One way, with mappings to keys in the left half of the alphanumeric section (shown green in the diagram above), emulates a numeric keypad with the digits 1,2,3 in the upper row. The other way, with mappings to keys in the right half (shown blue in the diagram above), emulates one with the digits 7,8,9 in the upper row. The affected keys of any emulation, if in effect, are to be pressed simultaneously with the Function key (which has to be present outside of the alphanumeric section) to provide the effect of the according key of a numeric keypad.

ISO/IEC 9995-3

Common secondary group
ISO/IEC 9995-3:2010 defines a common secondary layout (“common secondary group”) for the alphanumeric keyboard. These are engraved on the right part of the keytops; the standard defines their position independent of the characters of the primary layout. Thus, e. g. the Yen symbol “¥” occupies the shifted position on the 6th letter key of the second row, whether this is the Y key on a QWERTY keyboard (like the US layout) or the Z key on a QWERTZ keyboard (like the German layout).

Diacritical marks and peculiar characters
The diacritical marks contained in the common secondary group act as dead keys, i.e. they are to be entered before the base characters they apply to. This mechanism is also to be used for sequences of more than one diacritical marks, to write languages like Vietnamese and Navajo.

Moreover, ISO/IEC 9995-3:2010 defines a list of “Peculiar Characters which can be entered as combinations using diacritical marks”.
This list specifies combinations of a diacritical mark and a second key. E.g., symbols like the not-equal sign “≠” (Unicode U+2160) can be entered this way. Especially, letters with a horizontal stroke (like Serbo-Croatian Đ/đ, Maltese Ħ/ħ, or Comanche Ʉ/ʉ) are entered this way using the ""horizontal stroke accent"" located on the K key.

Outdated common secondary group
The standard additionally defines an “outdated common secondary group” for compatibility purposes only. This resembles the “common secondary group” defined in the earlier edition of the standard, ISO/IEC 9995-3:2002.

The outdated ISO/IEC 9995-3:2002 applied to the US keyboard layout

Complementary Latin group layout

For cases where no national keyboard layout is available, or to be used as an additional group on layouts designed for other scripts than Latin, the standard specifies a “Complementary Latin group layout”. It is based on the “harmonized 48 graphic key keyboard arrangement” as defined in ISO/IEC 9995-2 (see description above). The assignment shown with red background shall occur once at one of the indicated positions.

The Complementary Latin group layout according to ISO/IEC 9995-3:2010

ISO/IEC 9995-4

ISO/IEC 9995-4 specifies the layout of the numeric section of a keyboard, if such one exists. It is subdivided into the function zone (shown with grey background in the left figure) and the numeric zone (shown with white background). The leftmost key in the lowest row may span to the left, occupying the position shown with yellow background.

The decimal digits 1…9 may be arranged in an “1-2-3 layout” (shown in green, named according to the keys in the D row), or in a ”7-8-9 layout” (shown in blue).

On a keyboard used for telematic functions, the symbols “” and “#” represent the initiator and the terminator. On a keyboard used for office purposes, the key denoted by “#” shall show the decimal separator (usually a dot or a comma, dependent on the user language). On such keyboards, the key position marked by the asterisk may be an extension of the “0” key, or a “double zero” key. Accordingly, if the yellow key position is used, it may be also an extension of the “0” key, a “double zero” key, or a “triple zero” key.

The keys in the function zone may be associated to the arithmetic function they denote, or to the arithmetic characters, dependent of the software which is used. If an additional tabulator key or another special key is used, it shall be located at the position C54 (according to the reference grid specified in ISO/IEC 9995-1), thus occupying the lower half of the place shown for the “=” key.

Numeric sections on usual keyboards for personal computers do not comply to the standard, as they usually have a Num lock key in the upper left corner where the standard requires the “+” key, and therefore also show a different arrangement of the other arithmetic keys (usually lacking an “=” key; see the second picture). By this, the standard in its present form (ISO/IEC 9995-4:2009) can be considered outdated.

ISO/IEC 9995-5

ISO/IEC 9995-5 specifies the layout of the editing and function section of a keyboard. In fact, it specifies only two items:
 The Escape key has to be at the position K00 according to the reference grid specified in ISO/IEC 9995-1, or to the left of it (i. e., it has to be positioned near the left border of the first row above of the alphanumeric section).
 The four cursor keys (up, down, left, and right) in the cursor key zone (as specified in ISO/IEC 9995-1) have to be arranged in a “cross layout” or an “inverted T layout” (see figure). The recommended placement is such that the “cursor down” key is placed on row A (i. e., in the same row as the space bar).

ISO/IEC 9995-7

ISO/IEC 9995-7 specifies several keyboard symbols used to represent functions. There is a publicly available listing in a proposal to encode these symbols as Unicode characters (which is still pending, as of March 2017). The figure shown above in the ISO/IEC 9995-2 section shows several examples. They are used extensively e. g. in the keyboard standard of the Province of Quebec, Canada.

ISO/IEC 9995-8
ISO/IEC 9995-8:2009 defines an assignment identical to E.161 of the 26 letters A–Z to the number keys of a numeric keypad. The space character is not assigned.

ISO/IEC 9995-10

ISO/IEC 9995-10 specifies several symbols to enable the unique identification of characters on keytops which otherwise can easily be misidentified (as em vs. en dashes). Also, it specifies a way to present diacritical marks, especially on dead keys. There is a publicly available listing of these symbols in a proposal to encode them as Unicode characters (which is still pending, as of March 2017).

"Defecation

Defecation is the final act of digestion, by which organisms eliminate solid, semisolid, or liquid waste material from the digestive tract via the anus.

Humans expel feces with a frequency varying from a few times daily to a few times weekly. Waves of muscular contraction (known as peristalsis) in the walls of the colon move fecal matter through the digestive tract towards the rectum. Undigested food may also be expelled this way, in a process called egestion.

Open defecation, the practice of defecating outside without using a toilet of any kind, is still widespread in some developing countries, for example in India.

Description

Physiology
The rectum ampulla (anatomically also: ampulla recti) temporarily stores fecal waste. As the waste fills the rectum and expands the rectal walls, nervous system stretch receptors in the rectal walls stimulate the desire to defecate. This urge to defecate arises from the reflex contraction of rectal muscles, relaxation of the internal anal sphincter, and an initial contraction of the skeletal muscle of the external anal sphincter. If the urge is not acted upon, the material in the rectum is often returned to the colon by reverse peristalsis, where more water is absorbed and the faeces is stored until the next mass peristaltic movement of the transverse and descending colon. If defecation is delayed for a prolonged period the fecal matter may harden, resulting in constipation. If defecation occurs too fast, before excess liquid is absorbed, diarrhea may occur.

When the rectum is full, an increase in intra-rectal pressure forces apart the walls of the anal canal, allowing the fecal matter to enter the canal. The rectum shortens as material is forced into the anal canal and peristaltic waves push the feces out of the rectum. The internal and external anal sphincters along with the puborectalis muscle allow the feces to be passed by muscles pulling the anus up over the exiting feces. 

Defecation is normally assisted by taking a deep breath and trying to expel this air against a closed glottis (Valsalva maneuver). This contraction of expiratory chest muscles, diaphragm, abdominal wall muscles, and pelvic diaphragm exerts pressure on the digestive tract. Ventilation at this point temporarily ceases as the lungs push the chest diaphragm down to exert the pressure. Thoracic blood pressure rises and as a reflex response the amount of blood pumped by the heart decreases. Death has been known to occur in cases where defecation causes the blood pressure to rise enough to cause the rupture of an aneurysm or to dislodge blood clots (see thrombosis). Also, in releasing the Valsalva maneuver blood pressure falls; this, coupled with standing up quickly to leave the toilet, can result in a blackout.

During defecation, the external sphincter muscles relax. The anal and urethral sphincter muscles are closely linked. Experiments by Harrison Weed at the Ohio State University Medical Center have shown they can be contracted only together, not individually, and that both show relaxation during urination. This explains why defecation is frequently accompanied by urination.

Voluntary and involuntary control
Defecation may be involuntary or voluntary. Young children learn voluntary control through the process of toilet training. Once trained, loss of control, called fecal incontinence, may be caused by physical injury, nerve injury, prior surgeries (such as an episiotomy), constipation, diarrhea, loss of storage capacity in the rectum, intense fright, inflammatory bowel disease, psychological or neurological factors, childbirth, or death.

Sometimes, due to the inability to control one's bowel movement or due to excessive fear, defecation (usually accompanied by urination) occurs involuntarily, soiling a person's undergarments. This may cause significant embarrassment to the person if this occurs in the presence of other people or in a public place.

Posture

The positions and modalities of defecation are culture-dependent. Squat toilets are used by the vast majority of the world, including most of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The use of sit-down toilets in the Western world is a relatively recent development, beginning in the 19th century with the advent of indoor plumbing.

Health aspects
Attempting forced expiration of breath against a closed airway (the valsalva maneuver) is sometimes practiced to induce defecation while on a toilet. Cardiac arrest and other cardiovascular complications can in rare cases occur due to attempting to defecate using the valsalva maneuver. Valsalva retinopathy is another pathological syndrome associated with the Valsalva maneuver.

Society and culture

Anal cleansing after defecation 

The anus and buttocks may be cleansed after defecation with toilet paper, similar paper products, or other absorbent material. In many cultures, such as Hindu and Muslim, water is used for anal cleansing after defecation, either in addition to using toilet paper or exclusively. When water is used for anal cleansing after defecation, toilet paper may be used for drying the area afterwards. Some doctors and people who work in the science and hygiene fields have stated that switching to using a bidet as a form of anal cleansing after defecation is both more hygienic and more environmentally friendly.

Mythology and tradition 

Some peoples have culturally significant stories in which defecation plays a role. For example:
In an Alune and Wemale legend from the island of Seram, Maluku Province, Indonesia, the mythical girl Hainuwele defecates valuable objects.
One of the traditions of Catalonia (Spain) relates to the caganer, a figurine depicting the act of defecation which appears in nativity scenes in Catalonia and neighbouring areas with Catalan culture. The exact origin of the caganer is lost, but the tradition has existed since at least the 18th century.

"1952 United States presidential election

The 1952 United States presidential election was the 42nd quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 1952. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower won a landslide victory over Democrat Adlai Stevenson, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932.

Incumbent Democratic President Harry S. Truman had remained silent about whether he would seek another full term, but the unpopular incumbent announced his withdrawal from the race following his defeat in the New Hampshire primary by Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver. After Truman's withdrawal, the president and other party leaders threw their support behind Stevenson, the moderate Governor of Illinois. Stevenson emerged victorious on the third presidential ballot of the 1952 Democratic National Convention, defeating Kefauver, Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia, and other candidates. The Republican nomination was primarily contested by conservative Senator  Robert A. Taft of Ohio and Eisenhower, a general who was widely popular for his leadership in World War II. With the support of Thomas E. Dewey and other party leaders, Eisenhower narrowly prevailed over Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, a young senator from California, as Eisenhower's running mate.

Republicans attacked Truman's handling of the Korean War and the broader Cold War, and alleged that Soviet spies had infiltrated the U.S. government. Democrats faulted Eisenhower for failing to condemn Republican Senator Joe McCarthy and other reactionary Republicans who they alleged had engaged in reckless and unwarranted attacks. Stevenson tried to separate himself from the unpopular Truman administration, instead campaigning on the popularity of the New Deal and lingering fears of another Great Depression under a Republican administration.

Eisenhower retained his enormous popularity from the war, as seen in his campaign slogan, ""I Like Ike."" Eisenhower's popularity and Truman's unpopularity led to a Republican victory, and Eisenhower won 55% of the popular vote. He carried every state outside of the South and won several Southern states that had almost always voted for Democrats since the end of Reconstruction. Republicans also won control of both houses of Congress.

Nominees

Republican Party

The fight for the Republican nomination was between General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who became the candidate of the party's moderate eastern establishment; Senator Robert A. Taft from Ohio, the longtime leader of the Republican Party's conservative wing; Governor Earl Warren of California, who appealed to Western delegates and independent voters; and former Governor Harold Stassen of Minnesota, who still had a base of support in the Midwest.

The moderate Eastern Republicans were led by New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, the party's presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948. The moderates tended to be interventionists, who felt that America needed to fight the Cold War overseas and confront the Soviet Union in Eurasia; they were also willing to accept most aspects of the social welfare state created by the New Deal in the 1930s. The moderates were also concerned with ending the Republicans' losing streak in presidential elections; they felt that the personally popular Eisenhower had the best chance of beating the Democrats. For this reason, Dewey himself declined the notion of a third run for president, even though he still had a large amount of support within the party. The GOP had been out of power for 20 years, and the sentiment that a proper two-party system needed to be reestablished was strong, also a Republican Party in control of the White House would have more incentive to rein in unpopular demagogues such as Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy.

The conservative Republicans, led by Taft, were based in the Midwest and parts of the South. The Midwest was a bastion of conservatism and isolationist sentiment, dislike of Europeans, in particular Great Britain, was common, and there was a widespread feeling that the British manipulated US foreign policy and were eager to kowtow to the Soviet Union, although attitudes were beginning to change among the younger generation who had fought in World War II. Taft had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 1940 and 1948 presidential elections, losing both times to moderate candidates from New York (Wilkie and Dewey). Taft, 63, felt that this was his last chance to run for president and so his friends and supporters worked extra hard to ensure that he would win the nomination.

Warren, although highly popular in California, refused to campaign in the presidential primaries and thus limited his chances of winning the nomination. He did retain the support of the California delegation, and his supporters hoped that, in the event of an Eisenhower–Taft deadlock, Warren might emerge as a compromise candidate.

After being persuaded to run, Eisenhower scored a major victory in the New Hampshire primary, when his supporters wrote his name onto the ballot, giving him an upset victory over Taft. However, from there until the Republican Convention the primaries were divided fairly evenly between the two, and by the time the convention opened, the race for the nomination was still too close to call. Taft won the Nebraska, Wisconsin, Illinois, and South Dakota primaries, while Eisenhower won the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Oregon primaries. Stassen and Warren only won their home states of Minnesota and California respectively, which effectively ended their chances of earning the nomination. General Douglas MacArthur also got ten delegates from various states (mostly Oregon), but had made it clear from early in the race that he had no interest in being nominated.

Republican Convention
When the 1952 Republican National Convention opened in Chicago, Illinois, most political experts rated Taft and Eisenhower as neck-and-neck in the delegate vote totals. Eisenhower's managers, led by Dewey and Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., accused Taft of ""stealing"" delegate votes in Southern states such as Texas and Georgia. They claimed that Taft's leaders in these states had unfairly denied delegate spots to Eisenhower supporters and put Taft delegates in their place. Lodge and Dewey proposed to evict the pro-Taft delegates in these states and replace them with pro-Eisenhower delegates; they called this proposal ""Fair Play."" Although Taft and his supporters angrily denied this charge, the convention voted to support Fair Play 658 to 548, and Taft lost many Southern delegates. Eisenhower also received two more boosts, firstly when several uncommitted state delegations, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, decided to support him, and secondly when Stassen released his delegates and asked them to support Eisenhower, whose moderate policies he much preferred to those of Taft. The removal of many pro-Taft Southern delegates and the support of the uncommitted states decided the nomination in Eisenhower's favor.

However, the mood at the convention was one of the most bitter and emotional in American history. When Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois, a Taft supporter, pointed at Dewey on the convention floor during a speech and accused him of leading the Republicans ""down the road to defeat,"" mixed boos and cheers rang out from the delegates, and there were even fistfights between some Taft and Eisenhower delegates.

In the end, Eisenhower narrowly defeated Taft on the first ballot. To heal the wounds caused by the battle, he went to Taft's hotel suite and met with him. Taft issued a brief statement congratulating Eisenhower on his victory, but he was bitter about what he felt was the untrue ""stealing delegates"" charge, and he withheld his active support for Eisenhower for several weeks after the convention. In September 1952 Taft and Eisenhower met again at Morningside Heights in New York City, where Taft promised to support Eisenhower actively in exchange for Eisenhower agreeing to a number of requests. These included a demand that Eisenhower give Taft's followers a fair share of patronage positions if he won the election, and that Eisenhower agree to balance the federal budget and ""fight creeping domestic socialism in every field."" Eisenhower agreed to the terms, and Taft campaigned hard for the Republican ticket. In fact, Eisenhower and Taft agreed on most domestic issues; their disagreements were primarily in foreign policy.

Though there were initial suggestions that Warren could have earned the party's vice presidential slot for the second successive election if he were to withdraw and endorse Eisenhower, he ultimately chose not to do so. Eisenhower himself had been partial to giving the VP nod to Stassen, who had endorsed Eisenhower of his own accord and had generally similar political positions. The party bosses, however, were keen to find a running mate who could mollify Taft's supporters, as the schism between the moderate and conservative wings was so severe that in the worst case it could potentially lead to the conservatives bolting and running Taft as a third-party candidate.

Eisenhower had apparently given little thought to choosing his running mate, when asked, he replied that he assumed the convention would pick someone. The spot ultimately fell to the young California Senator Richard Nixon, who was seen as being in the exact center of the GOP. Nixon was known as an aggressive campaigner and a fierce anti-communist, however he shied away from some of the more extreme ideas of the party's right wing, including isolationism and dismantling the New Deal. Most historians now believe that Eisenhower's nomination was primarily due to the feeling that he was a ""sure winner"" against the Democrats; most of the delegates were conservatives who would probably have supported Taft if they felt he could have won the general election.

Despite not earning the presidential or vice presidential nominations, Warren would subsequently be appointed as Chief Justice in October 1953, while Stassen would hold various positions within Eisenhower's administration.

The balloting at the Republican Convention went as follows:

Democratic Party

The expected candidate for the Democratic nomination was incumbent President Harry S. Truman. Since the newly passed 22nd Amendment did not apply to whoever was president at the time of its passage, he was eligible to run again. But Truman entered 1952 with his popularity plummeting, according to polls. The bloody and indecisive Korean War was dragging into its third year, Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade was stirring public fears of an encroaching ""Red Menace,"" and the disclosure of widespread corruption among federal employees (including some high-level members of Truman's administration) left Truman at a low political ebb. Polls showed that he had a 66% disapproval rating, a record only matched decades later by Richard Nixon and surpassed by George W. Bush.

Truman's main opponent was populist Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver, who had chaired a nationally televised investigation of organized crime in 1951 and was known as a crusader against crime and corruption. The Gallup poll of February 15 showed Truman's weakness: nationally Truman was the choice of only 36% of Democrats, compared with 21% for Kefauver. Among independent voters, however, Truman had only 18% while Kefauver led with 36%. In the New Hampshire primary, Kefauver upset Truman, winning 19,800 votes to Truman's 15,927 and capturing all eight delegates. Kefauver graciously said that he did not consider his victory ""a repudiation of Administration policies, but a desire...for new ideas and personalities."" Stung by this setback, Truman soon announced that he would not seek re-election (however, Truman insisted in his memoirs that he had decided not to run for reelection well before his defeat by Kefauver).

With Truman's withdrawal, Kefauver became the front-runner for the nomination, and he won most of the primaries. Other primary winners were Senator Hubert Humphrey, who won his home state of Minnesota, while Senator Richard Russell Jr. from Georgia won the Florida primary and U.S. diplomat W. Averell Harriman won West Virginia. However, most states still chose their delegates to the Democratic Convention via state conventions, which meant that the party bosses – especially the mayors and governors of large Northern and Midwestern states and cities – were able to choose the Democratic nominee. These bosses (including Truman) strongly disliked Kefauver; his investigations of organized crime had revealed connections between Mafia figures and many of the big-city Democratic political organizations. The party bosses thus viewed Kefauver as a maverick who could not be trusted, and they refused to support him for the nomination.

Instead, with Truman taking the initiative, they began to search for other, more acceptable, candidates. However, most of the other candidates had a major weakness. Richard Russell had much Southern support, but his support of racial segregation and opposition to civil rights for Southern blacks led many liberal Northern and Midwestern delegates to reject him. Truman favored W. Averell Harriman of New York, but he had never held an elective office and was inexperienced in politics. Truman next turned to his vice-president, Alben W. Barkley, but at 74 he was rejected as being too old by labor union leaders.
Other minor or favorite son candidates included Oklahoma Senator Robert S. Kerr, Governor Paul A. Dever of Massachusetts, Senator Hubert Humphrey from Minnesota, and Senator J. William Fulbright from Arkansas.

One candidate soon emerged who seemingly had few political weaknesses: Governor Adlai Stevenson of Illinois. The grandson of former Vice-President Adlai E. Stevenson, he came from a distinguished family in Illinois and was well known as a gifted orator, intellectual, and political moderate. In the spring of 1952, Truman tried to convince Stevenson to take the presidential nomination, but Stevenson refused, stating that he wanted to run for re-election as Governor of Illinois. Yet Stevenson never completely took himself out of the race, and as the convention approached, many party bosses, as well as normally apolitical citizens, hoped that he could be ""drafted"" to run.

Democratic Convention
The 1952 Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago in the same coliseum the Republicans had gathered in several weeks earlier. Since the convention was being held in his home state, Governor Stevenson – who still proclaimed that he was not a presidential candidate – was asked to give the welcoming address to the delegates. He proceeded to give a witty and stirring address that led his supporters to begin a renewed round of efforts to nominate him, despite his protests. After meeting with Jacob Arvey, the ""boss"" of the Illinois delegation, Stevenson finally agreed to enter his name as a candidate for the nomination. The party bosses from other large Northern and Midwestern states quickly joined in support. Kefauver led on the first ballot, but had far fewer votes than necessary to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot.

After the delegates nominated Stevenson, the convention then turned to selecting a vice-presidential nominee. After narrowing it down to Senators John Sparkman, and A. S. Mike Monroney, President Truman and a small group of political insiders chose Sparkman, a conservative and segregationist from Alabama, for the nomination. The convention largely complied and nominated Sparkman as Stevenson's running mate. He was chosen because of his Southern identity and conservative record; party leaders hoped this factor would create a balanced ticket.

General election

Campaign issues
The Eisenhower campaign was one of the first presidential campaigns to make a major, concerted effort to win the female vote. Many of his radio and television commercials discussed topics such as education, inflation, ending the war in Korea, and other issues that were thought to appeal to women. The Eisenhower campaign made extensive use of female campaign workers. These workers made phone calls to likely Eisenhower voters, distributed ""Ike"" buttons and leaflets, and threw parties to build support for the GOP ticket in their neighborhoods. On election day, Eisenhower won a solid majority of the female vote.

Eisenhower campaigned by attacking ""Korea, Communism, and Corruption""—that is, what the Republicans regarded as the failures of the outgoing Truman administration to deal with these issues. The Eisenhower campaign accused the administration of ""neglecting Latin America"" and thus ""leading them into the arms of wily Communist agents waiting to exploit local misery and capitalize on any opening to communize the Americas."" Charges that Soviet spies had infiltrated the government plagued the Truman Administration and also became a ""major campaign issue"" for Eisenhower. The Republicans blamed the Democrats for the military's failure to be fully prepared to fight in Korea; they accused the Democrats of harboring communist spies within the federal government; and they blasted the Truman Administration for the numbers of officials who had been accused of various crimes.

Stevenson hoped to exploit the rift between the conservative Taft Republicans and the moderate Eisenhower Republicans. In a speech in Baltimore, Stevenson said, ""The GOP elephant has two heads nowadays, and I can't tell from day to day who's driving the poor beast, Senator Taft or the General. I doubt that America will entrust its future, its hopes, to the master of a house divided against itself."" Stevenson, Truman, and other Democrats campaigning that fall also criticized Senator Joseph McCarthy and other right-wing Republicans for what they believed were reckless and unwarranted attacks and congressional investigations into leading government officials and public servants. In a Salt Lake City speech Stevenson stated that right-wing Republicans were ""quick with accusations, with defamatory hints and whispering campaigns when they see a chance to scare or silence those with whom they disagree. Rudely, carelessly, they invade the field of thought, of conscience, which belongs to God, and not to Senators...McCarthy and men like him can say almost anything, and if my opponent's conscience permits, he can try to help all of them get reelected."" Stevenson said that right-wing attacks on government officials such as General George Marshall, who had served Truman as Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, reflected a ""middle of the gutter approach"" to politics. President Truman repeatedly criticized Senator McCarthy's character and temperament, and called on Eisenhower to repudiate him. Stevenson ridiculed right-wing Republicans ""who hunt Communists in the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries while hesitating to aid the gallant men and women who are resisting the real thing in the front lines of Europe and Asia...They are finally the men who seemingly believe that we can confound the Kremlin by frightening ourselves to death."" In return, Senator McCarthy often jokingly confused the names Adlai and Alger, the first name of convicted Soviet spy Alger Hiss, by stating ""Alger, I mean Adlai..."" in his speeches. McCarthy, in response to Stevenson's criticisms, also stated during the campaign that he would like to get on the Stevenson campaign trail ""with a club and make a good and loyal American"" out of Stevenson.

Neither Stevenson nor Sparkman had been a part of the Truman administration and they largely ignored its record, preferring to hark back to the Roosevelt's New Deal achievements while warning of against a repetition of the Hoover depression. Historian Herbert Parmet says that although Stevenson:
tried to separate his campaign from Truman's record, his efforts failed to dispel the widespread recognition that, for a divided America, torn by paranoia and unable to understand what had disrupted the anticipated tranquility of the postwar world, the time for change had really arrived.  Neither Stevenson nor anyone else could have dissuaded the electorate from its desire to repudiate 'Trumanism.'

Campaign

Many Democrats were particularly upset when Eisenhower, on a scheduled campaign swing through Wisconsin, decided not to give a speech he had written criticizing McCarthy's methods, and then allowed himself to be photographed shaking hands with McCarthy as if he supported him. Truman, formerly friends with Eisenhower, never forgot what he saw as a betrayal; he had previously thought Eisenhower would make a good president, but said, ""he has betrayed almost everything I thought he stood for.""

Eisenhower retained his enormous personal popularity from his leading role in World War II, and huge crowds turned out to see him around the nation. His campaign slogan, ""I Like Ike,"" was one of the most popular in American history. Stevenson attracted the support of the young, emergent postwar intellectual class, however Eisenhower was seen as more appealing to Main Street. Stevenson was ridiculed in some quarters as too effeminate to be president, the staunchly conservative New York Daily News called him ""Adelaide"" Stevenson, even though he had a reputation as a ladies' man and several mistresses.

A notable event of the 1952 campaign concerned a scandal that emerged when Richard Nixon, Eisenhower's running mate, was accused by several newspapers of receiving $18,000 in undeclared ""gifts"" from wealthy donors. In reality, contributions were by design only from early supporters and limited to $1,000, with full accountability.  Nixon, who had been accusing the Democrats of hiding crooks, suddenly found himself on the defensive. Eisenhower and his aides considered dropping Nixon from the ticket and picking another running mate.

Eisenhower, who barely knew Nixon, waffled and refused to comment on the incident. Nixon saved his political career, however, with a dramatic half-hour speech, the ""Checkers speech,"" on live television. In this speech, Nixon denied the charges against him, gave a detailed account of his modest financial assets, and offered a glowing assessment of Eisenhower's candidacy. The highlight of the speech came when Nixon stated that a supporter had given his daughters a gift – a dog named ""Checkers"" – and that he would not return it, because his daughters loved it. The ""Checkers speech"" led hundreds of thousands of citizens nationwide to wire the Republican National Committee urging the Republican Party to keep Nixon on the ticket, and Eisenhower stayed with him.

Despite the red-baiting of the right wing of the GOP, the campaign on the whole was conducted with a considerable degree of dignity and Stevenson was seen as reinvigorating a Democratic Party that had become exhausted after 20 years in power and refreshing its appeal with younger voters. He accused Eisenhower of silently tolerating Joseph McCarthy's excesses. Stevenson went before the American Legion, a bastion of hardline conservatism, and boldly declared that there was nothing patriotic or American about what Joseph McCarthy was doing.

Even with the dignified nature of the campaign, the dislike between the two candidates was visible; Stevenson criticized Eisenhower's non-condemnation of McCarthy and use of television spots, and Eisenhower, while he had initially respected Stevenson, in time came to view him as simply another career politician, something he strongly disliked.

The 1952 election campaign was the first one to make use of the new medium of television, in part thanks to the efforts of Rosser Reeves, the head of the Ted Bates Agency, a leading advertising firm. Reeves had initially proposed a series of radio spots to Thomas Dewey in the 1948 campaign, but Dewey considered them undignified, and Reeves maintained that Dewey might have won the election had he been slightly more open-minded.

Studying Douglas MacArthur's keynote speech at the Republican convention in July, Reeves believed that the general's words were ""powerful"", but ""unfocused"" and ""all over the map"". Eisenhower's public speeches were even worse, he was unable to make his point to the voting public in a clear, intelligible manner. Reeves felt that Eisenhower needed to condense his message down to a few simple, easily digestible slogans.

Eisenhower at first also fared poorly on television and had a difficult time appearing relaxed and at ease on camera. The TV lighting was not flattering and it made him look old and unattractive, in particular his forehead tended to glisten under the lights. Eisenhower became upset when CBS correspondent Dave Schoenbrun pointed this out and suggested he try altering his poses to make his forehead less noticeable and also apply makeup so it would not shine from the lighting. Eventually, he gave in and agreed to these modifications. Reeves also wanted Eisenhower to not wear his eyeglasses on camera in order to look younger, but he could not read the prompter board without them, so Reeves devised a large, handwritten signboard.

Reeves's TV work, although pioneering, was the subject of considerable criticism on the grounds that he was attempting to sell a presidential candidate to the public in the same manner that one might sell a car or a brand of toothpaste. Adlai Stevenson for his part would have nothing to do with television at all and condemned Eisenhower's use of the medium, calling it ""selling the presidency like cereal"". He himself made a point of the fact that he did not own a TV or watch television, and many of his inner circle did likewise.

Both campaigns made use of television ads. A notable ad for Eisenhower was an issue-free, feel-good animated cartoon with a soundtrack song by Irving Berlin called ""I Like Ike."" For the first time, a presidential candidate's personal medical history was released publicly, as were partial versions of his financial histories, because of the issues raised in Nixon's speech. Near the end of the campaign, Eisenhower, in a major speech, announced that if he won the election he would go to Korea to see if he could end the war. His great military prestige, combined with the public's weariness with the conflict, gave Eisenhower the final boost he needed to win.

Throughout the entire campaign, Eisenhower led in all opinion polls, and by wide margins in most of them.

Citizens for Eisenhower
To circumvent the local Republican Party apparatus mostly controlled by Taft supporters, the Eisenhower forces created a nationwide network of grass-roots clubs, ""Citizens for Eisenhower."" Independents and Democrats were welcome, as the group specialized in canvassing neighborhoods and holding small group meetings. Citizens for Eisenhower hoped to revitalize the GOP by expanding its activist ranks and by supporting  moderate and internationalist policies. It did not endorse candidates other than Eisenhower. However Eisenhower paid it little attention after he won, and it failed to maintain its impressive starting momentum. Instead it energized the conservative Republicans, leading finally to the Barry Goldwater campaign of 1964. Long-time  Republican activists viewed the  newcomers with suspicion and hostility. More significantly, activism in support of Eisenhower did not translate into enthusiasm for the party cause.

Results
On election day, Eisenhower won a decisive victory, winning over 55% of the popular vote and carrying thirty-nine of the forty-eight states. Stevenson did not win a single state north of the Mason–Dixon line or west of Arkansas, whilst Eisenhower took three Southern states that the Republicans had won only once since Reconstruction: Virginia, Florida, and Texas. Despite the Republican win in Florida, this remains the last time to date a Democrat has won Collier County before southwestern Florida was turned into a growing Sun Belt Republican stronghold, and is also the last time a Democrat has won Aiken County, South Carolina, before the ""Solid South"" would collapse in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement. 1952 is also, however, the last time a Republican won Yolo County, California, or Native American Rolette County, North Dakota, and the last until Donald Trump in 2016 that the Republicans won Pacific County, Washington, or Swift County, Minnesota. This was the last time the Republicans won Missouri until 1968 and the last time the Democrats won Kentucky until 1964. It is also the last time that a Republican won the election without Kentucky. Stevenson's 700-vote win was the smallest percentage margin in any state since Woodrow Wilson won New Hampshire by fifty-six votes in 1916.

This election was the first in which a computer (the UNIVAC I) was used to predict the results.

"Sir Lambton Loraine, 11th Baronet

Lambton Loraine (17 November 1838 - 13 May 1917) was a British naval officer,  best remembered for his involvement in the ""Virginius Affair"" of 1873.

Oon 11 July 1852 he succeeded as 11th Baronet Loraine of Kirke Harle, Northumberland.  In the same year he entered the Royal Navy, originally as a Naval Cadet, a Captain noting at the time ""Sir Lambton Loraine Bart. Has very good talents, and promises to make a good draughtsman and surveyor.""
Sir Lambton joined  at Valparaiso in early 1853, at the age of 14 years, and was a Midshipman aboard the ship until 1857 at the end of her second commission based in the Pacific. He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1858 and served in the Mediterranean, then in 1864 he was appointed Flag-Lieutenant to Rear-Admiral the Hon. Joseph Denman, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Station. In 1866 he was acting commander of HMS Mutine during the hostilities between Spain and her former colonies, Peru and Chile, then in 1867 he was promoted to Commander.

The Virginius Affair

Since October 1870 the ship, Virginius, a sidewheel steamer over 200 ft (61m) long, capable of remarkable speed due to its powerful engines, was used to transport arms and men to aid the insurgencies against Spain in Cuba and Venezuela. The ship was regarded by Spain as a pirate ship and had several narrow escapes.

On 23 October 1873 Virginius sailed from Kingston, Jamaica with 102 Cuban insurgents. At Port-au-Prince 300 Remingtons and 300,000 cartridges were loaded on board. At Comito 800 daggers, 800 machetes, a barrel of powder and a case of shoes were loaded. The ship headed for Cuba, but never reached shore. About 6 miles from land it was intercepted by the Spanish warship Tornado under the command of Captain Dionisio Costilla and an 8-hour sea chase ensued. During this chase, guns and equipment were dropped overboard to lighten the ship, however the poor physical condition of the ship and engines caused Captain Fry to surrender the ship barely 6 miles from the Jamaican coast.

On 2 November 1873 a council of war was held by Spanish officials after the arrival of the captured Virginius at Santiago de Cuba harbour. Four ranking officers of the Army of Liberation were executed at 6am on 4 November 1873. Following a court-martial on 7 November the captain of Virginius and 36 members of the crew were executed by firing squad the same day. A further 12 Cuban revolutionaries were executed the next day. It was Sir Lambton Loraine who intervened, arriving at Santiago de Cuba harbour as Commander of the British warship HMS Niobe. Commander Loraine immediately sent the following communique to the Spanish Military Commander of Santiago, General Burriel:

Military Commander of Santiago – Sir: I have no orders from my government, because they are not aware of what is happening; but I assume the responsibility and I am convinced that my conduct will be approved by Her Britannic Majesty, because my actions are pro-humanity and pro-civilisation, I demand that you stop this dreadful butchery that is taking place here. I do not believe that I need explain what my actions will be in case my demand is not heeded. (signed) Lambton Loraine

Sir Lambton delivered the letter personally and did not leave the office of the military Governor until he received a satisfactory reply. His valiant intervention stopped the executing cold, and thus many Cubans, Americans and Britons were saved by his action. In April 1874, this Captain now, whom had spent his teenage years on HMS Trincomalee, was in New York for 13 days during which he was a welcome recipient of an almost continued round of receptions and evidences of public and private esteem.

On 25 April he departed New York, the New York Times reporting:

The vessel moved out of her dock a few minutes after 1 o’clock, Sir Lambton standing by the gangway with his umbrella raised, puffing quietly on his cigar and waving adieus with his hat to the little groups of friends on the pier, who sent him off with a hearty cheer.

Later life
Sir Lambton became a retired Captain in 1885, and a retired Rear-Admiral in 1889, dying at the age of 78 years on 13 May 1917.

He was the father of British diplomat Sir Percy Loraine (1880-1961).

"Nokesville, Virginia

Nokesville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Prince William County, Virginia, United States and Fauquier County, Virginia, United States. The population was 1,354 at the 2010 census.

History
Nokesville is the center of a farming community with cattle and dairy farms; it became a town and intermediate stop on the Orange & Alexandria Railway in 1865. In the late 19th century–early 20th century, Nokesville was the location of a religious movement called the German Baptist Brethren, which became known as the Church of the Brethren. In the 1950s, it was cut off from passenger trains and remains a rural community today.

Nokesville consists of four schools in Prince William. The oldest school, Nokesville Elementary was built in 1929 to serve all grades until 1964 when it was lowered to K-5 with the construction of Brentsville District High School.  In 2014, Nokesville Elementary moved to a new building that was built next to Brentsville District High School on Aden Road.  This new school is called The Nokesville School and serves a K-8 community. The old school was sold and is now a Montessori school. Patriot High School is located on Kettle Run Road, and was opened in 2011. Built concurrently, next door is T. Clay Wood Elementary School. The Nokesville postal delivery area consists of two schools in Fauquier. Kettle Run High School and Greenville Elementary are both new schools built on the Fauquier County side of Nokesville.

Marstellar Middle School is located nearby in Bristow, and middle school students formerly attended this middle school prior to the K–8 school opening.

The Lawn, Nokesville Truss Bridge, Brentsville Historic District, Park Gate, and Pilgrim's Rest, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

"Crianlarich Hills

The Crianlarich Hills are a large group of mountains in Scotland, running east of Crianlarich and Loch Lomond, south of Strath Fillan and north of Loch Doine. The range is within the Breadalbane section of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park and contains the highest mountains in the park. The mountains also are located in an area where the landscape becomes ever more remote and mountainous as landscapes go further into a wilderness starting from Tarbet on Loch Lomond. The highest mountain in the range is Ben More, which is also the highest in the national park and is one of the highest in Scotland.

The mountains of the range include:

"Forever Reign (One Sonic Society album)

Forever Reign is first studio album by One Sonic Society. Essential Worship Records released the album on 17 January 2012. One Sonic Society worked with Matt Bronleewe, in the production of this album.

Background
These songs are all from the three extended plays, One in 2010, Sonic in 2010, and Society in 2011, that preceded this studio album's release. The single, ""Forever Reign"", charted on two Billboard magazine charts.

Critical reception

Awarding the album three stars from CCM Magazine, Grace S. Aspinwall states, ""the philosophy behind this entire album, it's a truly beautiful thing."" Robert Ham, giving the album two and a half stars at AllMusic, writes, ""it should come as little surprise that this trio has concocted a collection of songs that seems sometimes a little too radio- and worship-service ready."" Rating the album three stars for Jesus Freak Hideout, Tincan Caldwell says, ""In the end, Forever Reign, though it is pleasant and at times soaring, suffers from the fate common to 'super group' albums. The collaborative skill of all those involved is usually good enough to deliver a few great songs, but after that, the ones that remain often feel tossed off.""

Jeremy Armstrong, awarding the album five stars by Worship Leader, describes, ""Forever Reign is the collection of the best of the EPs all in one place."" Giving the album an eight out of ten from Cross Rhythms, Paul S. Ganney states, ""The choruses are very singable, very uplifting, very easy to pick up."" Michael Dalton, rating the album a four out of five at The Phantom Tollbooth, writes, ""They wisely recognize that it is better to worship a transcendent God than to foster the illusion of being a super-group.""

Giving the album four stars for Indie Vision Music, Jonathan Andre says, ""Well done for a good debut album!"" Dave Wood, awarding the album four stars from Louder Than the Music, describes, ""With an extremely strong arsenal of songs already penned and powerful song writing and musical talents in their armory, One Sonic Society may be one of the quietest, most unassuming, yet amply gifted bands in worship music."" Rating the album a 4.25 out of five at Christian Music Zine, Joshua Andre states, ""With such a well received quiver of anthems under their belt that have been widely accepted in the church, One Sonic Society may just be the quiet achievers of 2012.""

"Trench raiding club

Trench raiding clubs were homemade melee weapons used by both the Allies and the Central Powers during World War I. Clubs were used during nighttime trench raiding expeditions as a quiet and effective way of killing or wounding enemy soldiers. The clubs were usually made out of wood. It was common practice to fix a metal object at the striking end (e.g. an empty Mills bomb) in order to maximize the injury inflicted. Another common design comprised a simple stave with the end drilled out and a lead weight inserted, with rows of large hobnails hammered in around its circumference. Most designs had some form of cord or leather strap at the end to wrap around the user's wrist. Bosnian soldiers serving in the Austro-Hungarian army were fond of using maces. They were also used by officers to finish enemy soldiers wounded by poison gas attacks.

Trench clubs were manufactured in bulk by units based behind the lines. Typically, regimental carpenters and metal workers would make large numbers of the same design of club.

They were generally used along with other melee weapons such as trench knives, entrenching tools, bayonets, hatchets, hammers, and pickaxe handles – backed up with handguns, shotguns, submachine guns, and hand grenades.

In popular culture
In the 1986 Vietnam War film Platoon the character Rhah (played by Francesco Quinn) carries a crude wooden staff wrapped in barb wire, which resembles a makeshift trench club.
In the film Defendor, the title character uses a trench club on a chain as his primary weapon and states that it had once belonged to his grandfather.
In the video game Team Fortress 2, a trench club is usable as a melee weapon by the Scout Class, under the name ""Boston Basher"".
In the video game Battlefield 1, players can use trench clubs as melee weapons.
In the video game Verdun, a trench club is available for use by the Canadian raiders.
In the Netflix television series Stranger Things, the character Steve (played by Joe Keery) carries a trench club made from a baseball bat as his weapon of choice.
In the comic series and its television adaptation The Walking Dead, the character Negan (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the show) carries a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire, a makeshift trench club he affectionately nicknames ""Lucille.""

"Peace of Étaples

The Peace of Etaples was signed in Étaples (northern France) between the kings Charles VIII Valois of France and Henry VII Tudor of England on 3 November 1492.

History
The treaty served to end an English invasion of France, launched in order to stop France's support for the pretender Perkin Warbeck. The English had landed at Calais and laid siege to Boulogne. By this treaty, France agreed to expel Warbeck and pay England an indemnity of £159,000.  The treaty was ratified in December.

The terms of the treaty included the English accepting French control of Brittany, the French withdrawing their support for Warbeck and a war indemnity of 742,000 crowns, payable at 50,000 crowns per annum, equivalent to 5% of the crown's annual income.

The treaty could be interpreted as a spectacular success, an English military incursion had forced the French to sue for peace, presenting it as 'the English are great again'. French abandonment of support for Warbeck removed one of Henry VII's key enemies. On the other hand, Henry VII had abandoned the Bretons and went back on the Treaty of Redon. However, this had already happened in 1491, and the benefits seemed to outweigh the costs. He did this whilst maintaining the Treaty of Medina del Campo (1489) with Spain so was therefore not too bothered of the loss of Brittany as a trading partner since the Medina del Campo enabled Henry VII to gain a healthy income.

After 1492 a rapprochement between England and France occurred. This improvement continued until the end of Henry VII's reign.

"Kuma-class cruiser

The five  were light cruisers operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). The Kuma-class cruisers proved useful in combat operations ranging from the Aleutian Islands to the Indian Ocean throughout World War II.

The Kuma-class was followed by the very similar .

Background
Despite the success of the  high speed light cruiser design, the Imperial Japanese Navy realized that they would be outgunned by the larger US Navy  and the Dutch Java-class of light cruisers then under development. In addition, the Tenryū-class vessels, with a maximum speed of , were unable to keep up with the newer Japanese destroyers, such as the , which had a design speed of . At the end of 1917, plans for an additional six Tenryū-class vessels, plus three new-design 7200 ton-class scout cruisers were shelved, in place of an intermediate 5,500 ton-class vessel which could be used as both a long-range, high speed reconnaissance ship, and also as a command vessel for destroyer or submarine flotillas.

With the development of the long range oxygen-propelled Type 93 ""Long Lance"" torpedoes in the 1930s, the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff drafted plans to create a special ""Night Battle Force"" of torpedo cruisers. The idea was based on Japan's success in the naval Battle of Port Arthur in the Russo-Japanese War. As the new Type 93 torpedoes had a range longer than that of contemporary battleships' main battery, the concept was to have a high speed strike force attack an enemy fleet at night with a massive and overwhelming barrage of torpedoes. Major surface combatants would follow up at dawn to finish off the wounded enemy.

Ōi and Kitakami were subsequently modified with ten quadruple mount torpedo launchers (a total of 40 tubes), arranged in two broadside rows of five, i.e. 20 per side. The ships were assigned to the CruDiv 9 of the IJN 1st Fleet. However, the rapid development of naval aviation and submarine warfare in the 1930s quickly made this plan obsolete. In January 1942, Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Matome Ugaki expressed strong disapproval of the newly remodeled torpedo cruisers and urged a revision to the Navy's tactics. While the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff debated the issue, Ōi and Kitakami were converted to high speed transports, with , and Kitakami was subsequently converted into a carrier for kaiten suicide torpedoes.

Design
The Kuma-class hull design was based on a 5,500 ton nominal displacement, with a high freeboard and light bridge structure, behind which was a tripod mast with the fire control platform and two searchlights. The design proved so versatile that it became the standard upon which all future light cruisers in the Japanese navy would be based.

The propulsion system for the Kuma class was based on four axial deceleration turbines with 12 boilers, providing . Ten boilers were designed to burn heavy oil, and the remaining two burned a mixture of coal and oil. With improvements in geared-turbine engine technology, the Kuma-class vessels were capable of the high speed of , and a range of  at . The silhouette of the Kuma class was discernible by its three smoke stacks, with the stacks flaring out in a trumpet shape.

The number of 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns was increased from four on the Tenryū class to seven on the Kuma class, centerline mounted in individual gun turrets, (two fore, three after and one on either side of the bridge). The positioning meant that only six of the guns could be brought to bear in a broadside. As with the Tenryū class, the Kuma class remained highly deficient in anti-aircraft protection, with only two 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type naval guns and two 6.5 mm machine guns. Provision was made for 48 naval mines. The two triple torpedo launchers on the Tenryū class was changed to four double launchers, placed in pairs so that four torpedoes could be fired on each side. Eight reloads were also provided.

Kiso was unique in that it had both a forward and aft flat surfaced superstructure, with a rotating floatplane take-off platform located aft. The platform appears to have never been used, and was removed in 1922, but her superstructure retained the shape of the hangar.

In service modifications
From 1931-1932, provision was made for a catapult to launch one floatplane (typically a Kawanishi E7K1 ""Alf"" floatplane ) for scouting purposes on Kuma and Tama. The catapult was situated aft, in between the No.5 and No.6 turrets.

From 1933-1934, the ships were renovated with a modified superstructure, replacing the canvas sides of the bridge with steel plate, and building a rangefinder tower behind the bridge was with either an  or  rangefinder. Kiso was also given anti-rain caps on her two forward stacks, which gave her a unique appearance.

By 1941, the 8-cm Type 3 guns were replaced by a twin-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns, and the 6.5 mm machine guns were upgraded to 13.2 mm. All of the ships in the Kuma class were progressively upgraded during the Pacific War. The modifications varied from vessel to vessel, but consisted of removing the aircraft catapult and at least one of the main 140-mm turrets, and replacing with twin or triple-mount Type 96 25-mm anti-aircraft guns. From 1943-1944, Kiso and Tama were given a twin turret with 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns. Kiso, Tama and Kitakami were the only in the class to receive radar.

In August 1941 Ōi,  Kitakami and Kiso were to undergo a conversion to torpedo cruisers to form a special torpedo attack squadron, but not enough Type 92 quadruple torpedo mounts were available so only the first two were converted, both ships three aft turrets were replaced by ten quadruple torpedo mounts, five per side, with a total of 40 torpedoes. In August 1942, they were modified into fast transports, with all of the torpedo tubes removed and replaced by Daihatsu class landing craft, with depth charge racks and two Type 96 triple-mount anti-aircraft guns.

After Kitakami was damaged in 1944, she was converted into a kaiten carrier, with all of her armament removed, and replaced by two Type 89 single gun turrets (fore and aft), a total of 67 Type 96 anti-aircraft guns(12 triple, 31 single), two depth charge racks and eight Model 1 Kaiten. Removal of the aft turbine engines reduced her speed to 23 knots.

Ships in class
Five vessels were built in the Kuma class. Only one (Kitakami) survived the Pacific War.

 (球磨)

Ordered in 1917 to the Sasebo Navy Yard, launched 14 July 1919, and completed 31 August 1920, Kuma was active in screening the landings of Japanese troops in the Philippines in the early months of World War II, and remained stationed there for local defense. Later assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet in the Netherlands East Indies, she was refit at Singapore from October–November 1943. She was torpedoed by the submarine  off the west coast of Malaya on 10 March 1944.

Ordered in 1917 to Mitsubishi in Nagasaki, launched 10 February 1920, and completed 29 January 1921, Camouflaged in Arctic colors, Tama participated in the Aleutian Islands Campaign and the Battle of the Komandorski Islands and spent most of the early part of World War II in northern waters. She was later used as a fast transport and made numerous sorties to Rabaul and other locations in the Solomon Islands. After refit in Japan in late 1943, she remained in Japanese home waters until reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy’s all-out final defense of the Philippines in October 1944. She was at the Battle of Leyte Gulf, where she was damaged by USN aircraft and was torpedoed by USN submarines northeast of the Philippines on 25 October 1944 while attempting to return to Okinawa.

 (北上)

Ordered in 1917 to the Sasebo Naval Arsenal, launched 3 July 1920, and completed 15 April 1921, Kitakami was converted into a torpedo cruiser under a short-lived Imperial Japanese Navy program, which was abandoned at the eve of World War II. She subsequently participated in Battle of Midway as part of the Aleutian screening force. She was later used as a fast transport and made numerous sorties to Rabaul and other locations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. From March 1943, she was assigned to the Southwest Area Fleet for escort and transport duties. After taking severe damage in a torpedo attack by the submarine  on 27 January 1944, she returned to Japan for conversion to carrier for Kaiten human torpedoes, but never served in this capacity due to lack of fuel. She survived the end of the war, and was used as a tender for repatriation vessels after the war. She was scrapped from 10 August 1946 – 31 March 1947.

Ordered in 1917 to the Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Kobe, launched 15 July 1920, and completed 3 November 1921, Ōi was converted into a torpedo cruiser under a short-lived Imperial Japanese Navy programme, which was abandoned at the eve of World War II. She subsequently participated in the Battle of Midway as part of the Aleutian screening force. She was later used as a fast transport and made numerous sorties to Rabaul and other locations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea.

She was later used as a fast transport. After refit in Japan in late 1943, she remained in Japanese home waters until reassigned to the Imperial Japanese Navy’s all-out final defense of the Philippines in October 1944. She survived the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and was assigned guard duties in the Philippines. She was sunk by USN carrier-based aircraft west of Manila on 13 November 1944.

"Classic International Cruises

Classic International Cruises was a British-Australian owned shipping company operating five luxury cruise ships, most notably their flagship, the rebuilt ocean liner MS Athena.  The company only operated cruise ships that are former ocean liners, the classic ships of their day (hence the company's name).

History

Classic International Cruises was seemingly founded in 1985, with the purchase of the MV Funchal as the Arcalia Shipping Company Ltd, which eventually became Classic International.  They operated the one ship until 1994, when they bought the Princess  Danae. The Princess Danae entered service with an all-white hull and a sailing ship logo on her funnel. Funchal was given a yellow and blue striped funnel and a white hull, but by 2000 her livery was changed to what now all Classic International ships have. Since 2000 they have purchased 3 ships, Arion, Athena and Princess Daphne, the near-identical sister of Princess Danae. With their main headquarters in Lisbon, Portugal, the company also has several branches based in Paris, France, Piraeus, Greece, Neutral Bay, Australia, Stockholm, Sweden, and London, England.

Due to unpaid bills by the line, the company's four ships, Princess Danae, Princess Daphne, Athena & Arion have all been arrested, the only ship not arrested is the Funchal which is laid up pending refurbishment for SOLAS.

On 20 December 2012, it was resolved to place the company into liquidation.

In the beginning of 2013, the recently created cruise company Portuscale Cruises, led by the Portuguese entrepreneur Rui Alegre, bought Princess Danae, Athena, Arion and Funchal, assuming as well the liabilities of Classic International Cruises.

"Stylonurella

Stylonurella is a genus of prehistoric eurypterid. It is classified within the Parastylonuridae family and contains three species, S. arnoldi and S. beecheri from the Devonian of Pennsylvania, United States and S. spinipes from the Silurian of Kip Burn, Scotland.

Description 

Stylonurella was a small stylonuroid, possessing a subquadrate prosoma with approximately the same length as width. The midsection was slightly constricted and the eyes were parallel and anteriorly located in the anterior half of the carapace. The metastoma and first two appendages are unknown, the third and fourth prosomal legs are very short and the last two walking legs are very long. The metasoma is very narrow.

Classification 
Though one of the earliest described stylonurines, described shortly after the description of Stylonurus itself, it has no close relations to that genus. Indeed, there are numerous and apparent differences. For instance, the eyes of Stylonurus are located on the posterior half of the carapace and those of Stylonurella are on the anterior half. Furthermore, there are noticeable differences between Stylonurella and its closest relative, Parastylonurus, for instance the widely different shapes of the carapaces (quadrate in Stylonurella and subrounded in Parastylonurus).

Species 

Stylonurella contains three valid species, with other named species now seen as invalid or as part of other genera.
 Stylonurella? arnoldi Ehlers, 1935  - Pennsylvania, USA (Devonian)
 Stylonurella? beecheri Hall, 1884 - Pennsylvania, USA (Devonian)
 Stylonurella spinipes Page, 1859 - Kip Burn, Scotland (Silurian)
Invalid or reassigned species are listed below:
 ""Stylonurella"" logani Woodward, 1872 - Kip Burn, Scotland (Silurian), synonym of S. spinipes.
 ""Stylonurella"" modestus Clarke & Ruedemann, 1912 - New York, USA (Ordovician), a pseudofossil.
 ""Stylonurella"" otisius Clarke, 1907 - Eastern USA (Silurian), reclassified as a species of Clarkeipterus.

"When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes

""When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes"" is a song written by Holland–Dozier–Holland and recorded in 1963 by Motown singing group The Supremes. It is notable as the Supremes' first Billboard Hot 100 Top 40 recording, following seven previous singles between January 1961 and September 1963 which failed to enter the Top 40. The single is also notable as the first Supremes single written and produced by Holland–Dozier–Holland, who had previously created hits for Martha and the Vandellas and Mary Wells.

Overview

Recording
By 1963, the Supremes were struggling to find a pop hit. Until then, the Supremes was a regional R&B favorite, with their most successful single being ""A Breathtaking Guy"", which peaked at number 75 on the Hot 100. The group's competitors inside Motown included The Marvelettes, Motown's first successful female group, but also with Martha and the Vandellas, whose early hits included ""(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave"" and ""Quicksand"".

Struggling to find producers who could give the Supremes a successful hit after both he and Smokey Robinson had failed, Motown CEO Berry Gordy decided to have the team of Holland–Dozier–Holland, who would end up being the dominant songwriting and producing team of Motown, produce a song for the Supremes.  ""Lovelight"" would eventually be released after Gordy's Quality Control Department approved of the song.

Reception
Released on October 31, 1963, ""When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes"" was the Supremes' first Top 40 pop hit since signing with Motown in 1961. Eventually reaching number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 2 on the Cash Box R&B chart, Gordy decided to have Holland-Dozier-Holland on board as the group's sole producers from then on. It also nearly made the Top 10 in Australia.  After the unsuccessful rush-release of the Phil Spector-inspired ""Run, Run, Run"", the Supremes would eventually eclipse their female peers after releasing ""Where Did Our Love Go"" in the summer of 1964.

Personnel
Lead vocals by Diana Ross
Background vocals by Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson
Additional vocals (growling before instrumental) by: The Four Tops (Levi Stubbs, Abdul ""Duke"" Fakir, Lawrence Payton and Renaldo ""Obie"" Benson) and Holland–Dozier–Holland (Edward ""Eddie"" Holland, Jr., Lamont Dozier and Brian Holland)
Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers
Written by Holland–Dozier–Holland
Produced by Lamont Dozier and Brian Holland

Chart history

Later Versions
Dusty Springfield included the song on her 1964 debut album A Girl Called Dusty.

The Zombies did a version in 1965 (available on Live At The BBC, released 2003)

In 1975, Motown Records released a new version of the song (catalog number 1334) by The Boones, a vocal quartet featuring four daughters of Pat Boone (including Debby of ""You Light Up My Life"" fame).  This version reached No. 25 on Billboard magazine's Adult Contemporary chart.

The Seattle-based electro-pop band Brite Futures included this song on their 2012 posthumous album ""When The Lights Go Out"".

"Eastern Cape Division

The Eastern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa is a superior court of law with general jurisdiction over the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The main seat of the division is at Makhanda, with subordinate local seats at Port Elizabeth, East London, Bhisho and Mthatha.  the Judge President of the division is Selby Mbenenge.

History
A superior court was first established at Grahamstown in 1864, as the Court of the Eastern Districts of the Cape of Good Hope, to ease access to justice for the residents of what is now the Eastern Cape. The Eastern Districts Court was subordinate to the Supreme Court of the Cape of Good Hope in Cape Town, which had concurrent jurisdiction over the eastern districts. When the Union of South Africa was created in 1910, the Eastern Districts Court became the Eastern Districts Local Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa.

In 1957 the division was removed from the concurrent jurisdiction of the court at Cape Town and renamed as the Eastern Cape Provincial Division. In 1974 the South Eastern Cape Local Division was established in Port Elizabeth to serve that city and the surrounding districts, although the Grahamstown court retained concurrent jurisdiction; that court is now a local seat of the division.

In 1973 the Transkei was removed from the jurisdiction of the Grahamstown court when the Transkeian High Court was established at Mthatha. When the Transkei received nominal independence from South Africa, that court became the Supreme Court of the Transkei. Initially decisions could still be appealed from the court to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa, but in 1979 an Appellate Division was established in the Supreme Court of Transkei. A similar process took place in the Ciskei, which received nominal independence and established its own Supreme Court at Zwelitsha in 1981. In 1984 an Appellate Division was established and the court moved to new buildings in Bhisho.

When the Transkei and Ciskei were reincorporated in South Africa on 27 April 1994, their Supreme Courts remained in existence, but three months later their Appellate Divisions were abolished and their jurisdiction transferred to the South African Appellate Division. When the final Constitution came into force the remaining General Divisions became High Courts of South Africa, known as the Transkei Division and the Ciskei Division. In 2013 under the Superior Courts Act, 2013 they became local seats of the Eastern Cape division, once again subordinate to Grahamstown.

In December 2019 the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court of South Africa ruled against the ban of children without birth certificates from receiving basic education in South Africa. The court ruled that ""It is an important socioeconomic right directed, among other things, at promoting and developing a child’s personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to his or her fullest potential"" and that ""Basic education also provides a foundation for a child’s lifetime learning and work opportunities.""

"SIG Sauer P230

The SIG Sauer P230 is a small, semi-automatic handgun chambered in .32 ACP or .380 Auto. It was designed by SIG Sauer of Eckernförde, Germany. It was imported into the United States by SIGARMS in 1985. In 1996 it was replaced by the model P232.

Design 
The design and function of the P230 is of the simple fixed barrel, straight blow-back configuration. It has a reputation as a well-built firearm, and competes with the smaller Walther PPK. With its relatively narrow slide and frame it can be carried in an ankle holster or beneath body armor.

The P230 was available in both blued and all-stainless finishes. The blued version features a blued steel slide and a matching, anodized aluminum frame, whereas the stainless version was completely made from stainless steel. Both versions came with a molded polymer, wrap-around grip that is contoured to give the shooter a comfortable and secure hold on the pistol.

The trigger comes from the factory with a  single-action pull, and is capable of both single-action and double-action. Pulling back the slide sets the hammer backwards and downwards to its single-action position, making for a very short trigger pull, with minimal take-up. The double-action pull is longer and more stiff. It has no external safeties, though it does have a de-cocking lever positioned just above the right-handed shooter's thumb, on the left side of the grip. The lever provides for a safe method of lowering the hammer from its full-cocked, single-action position, to a ""half-cock"", double-action safe position where the hammer itself falls forward to a locking point about an eighth of an inch from the rear of the firing pin. Once de-cocked, it is physically impossible for the hammer to drop completely and contact the firing pin, which would otherwise greatly increase the risk of the unintentional discharge of a chambered round. In order for the round to discharge, the full double-action pull would have to be completed, which allows for the pistol to be carried reasonably safely with a round chambered. In addition, the SIG P232 has an automatic firing pin safety.

The sights are of the traditional SIG design and configuration, with a dot on the front sight and a rectangle on the rear sight. To aim using the sights, the shooter simply aligns the dot over the rectangle. The magazine release is located behind and below the magazine floor plate. The magazine is released by pushing the lever towards the rear of the grip, at which point the magazine can be removed from the pistol.

SIG Sauer P232 
The P232 incorporates more than 60 changes to the design of the P230. Most of the changes are internal. Some of the changes are:
 The P232 has a drop safety to block the firing pin.
 The P230 front sight is machined into the slide. The P232 slide is cut for a dovetailed front sight.
 The P230 slide has 12 narrow, shallow serrations. The P232 slide has 7 wide, deeper serrations.
 The P230 factory grip panels are flat and smooth plastic with some checkering. The P232 factory grip panels are thicker plastic and 100% stippled. (The grip panels are not interchangeable between the two models.)
 The P230 factory magazine floor plates are aluminum. The P232 factory magazine floor plates are plastic.

Overview 
Due to its small dimensions, it is easily carried as a backup weapon or as a concealed carry handgun, holding 8 + 1 rounds of .32 ACP or 7 + 1 rounds of .380 ACP (9mm Short), respectively.

Discontinuation 
Imports of the SIG Sauer P232 to the United States, and of spare parts and magazines, were discontinued in July 2014. Although the P230 and P232 are known for reliability and accuracy, market competition had increased with the proliferation of smaller, lighter and less expensive pistols chambered for the .380 ACP cartridge. The P232 and other SIG Sauer products manufactured in Germany were banned for export by the German Government, due to unlawful foreign arms sales by the U.S. State Department to the Colombian Defense Ministry.

"Hungry generation

The Hungry Generation () was a literary movement in the Bengali language launched by what is known today as the Hungryalist quartet, i.e. Binoy Mazumdar,  Shakti Chattopadhyay, Malay Roy Choudhury, Samir Roychoudhury and Debi Roy (alias Haradhon Dhara), during the 1960s in Kolkata, India. Due to their involvement in this avant garde cultural movement, the leaders lost their jobs and were jailed by the incumbent government. They challenged contemporary ideas about literature and contributed significantly to the evolution of the language and idiom used by contemporaneous artists to express their feelings in literature and painting.

The approach of the Hungryalists was to confront and disturb the prospective readers' preconceived colonial canons. According to Pradip Choudhuri, a leading philosopher and poet of the generation, whose works have been extensively translated in French, their counter-discourse was the first voice of post-colonial freedom of pen and brush. Besides the famous four mentioned above, Utpal Kumar Basu, Binoy Majumdar, Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Basudeb Dasgupta, Falguni Roy, Subhash Ghosh, Tridib Mitra, Alo Mitra, Ramananda Chattopadhyay, Anil Karanjai, Saileswar Ghosh, Karunanidhan Mukhopadhyay, and Subo Acharya were among the other leading writers and artists of the movement.

Origins
The origins of this movement stem from the educational establishments serving Chaucer and Spengler to the poor of India. The movement was officially launched, however, in November 1961 from the residence of Malay Roy Choudhury and his brother Samir Roychoudhury in Patna. They took the word Hungry from Geoffrey Chaucer's line ""In Sowre Hungry Tyme"" and they drew upon, among others, Oswald Spengler's histriographical ideas about the non-centrality of cultural evolution and progression, for philosophical inspiration. The movement was to last from 1961 to 1965. It is wrong to suggest that the movement was influenced by the Beat Generation, since Ginsberg did not visit Malay until April 1963, when he came to Patna. Poets Octavio Paz and Ernesto Cardenal were to visit Malay later during the 1960s. The hungry generation has some of the same ideals as The Papelipolas and the Barranquilla Group, both from Colombia, and the Spanish Generation of 68.

History 

This movement is characterized by expression of closeness to nature and sometimes by tenets of Gandhianism and Proudhonianism. Although it originated at Patna, Bihar  and was initially based in Kolkata, it had participants spread over  North Bengal, Tripura and Benares. According to Dr. Shankar Bhattacharya, Dean at Assam University, as well as Aryanil Mukherjee, editor of Kaurab Literary Periodical, the movement influenced Allen Ginsberg as much as it influenced American poetry through the Beat poets who visited Calcutta, Patna and Benares during the 1960-1970s. Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, now a professor and editor, was associated with the Hungry generation movement. Shakti Chattopadhyay, Saileswar Ghosh, Subhas Ghosh left the movement in 1964.

More than 100 manifestos were issued during 1961-1965. Malay's poems have been published by Prof P. Lal  from his Writers Workshop publication. Howard McCord published Malay Roy Choudhury's controversial poem Prachanda Boidyutik Chhutar i.e., Stark Electric Jesus from Washington State University in 1965. The poem has been translated into several languages of the world. Into German by Carl Weissner,in Spanish by Margaret Randall, in Urdu by Ameeq Hanfee, in Assamese by Manik Dass, in Gujarati by Nalin Patel, in Hindi by Rajkamal Chaudhary, and in English by Howard McCord.

Impact 

The works of these participants appeared in Citylights Journal 1, 2 and 3 published between 1964 and 1966, edited by Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and in special issues of American magazines including Kulchur edited by Lita Hornick, Klactoveedsedsteen edited by Carl Weissner, El Corno Emplunado edited by Margaret Randall,  Evergreen Review edited by Barney Rosset, Salted Feathersedited by Dick Bakken, Intrepid edited by Alan De Loach, and San Francisco Earthquake, during the 1960s. The Hungry Generation, also known as Hungryalism, challenged the mainstream literary genres. The group wrote poetry and prose in completely different forms and experimented with the contents. The movement changed the literary atmosphere of Bengal altogether. It had influences in Hindi, Marathi, Assamese and Urdu literatures.

Hungryalists and Krittibas 
There is a misconception that the Hungryalists and the Krittibas group were the same and that the Krittibas magazine was a Hungryalist platform. This is incorrect as the Krittibas was a group from the fifties. The Hungryalist movement was a sixties decade phenomenon. Krittibas magazine in its editorial had openly declared that they have no relations with the movement and that they do not approve of the philosophy of the movement.

"Batanes

Batanes (; , ) is an archipelagic province in the Philippines situated in the Cagayan Valley region. It is the northernmost province in the country, and also the smallest, both in population and land area. Its capital is Basco located on the island of Batan.

The island group is located approximately  north of the Luzon mainland and about  south of Taiwan, separated from the Babuyan Islands of Cagayan Province by the Balintang Channel, and from Taiwan by the Bashi Channel. The entire province is listed in the UNESCO tentative list for inscription in the World Heritage List. The government has been finalizing the site's inscription, establishing museums and conservation programs since 2001. The government aims to push for the site's inclusion between 2018 and 2019. Seven intangible heritage elements of the Ivatan have been set by the Philippine government in its initial inventory in 2012. The elements are undergoing a process to be included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists between 2018 and 2025.

Etymology
The name Batanes derives from the words Batan, the local word for the Ivatan people.

History

The ancestors of today's Ivatans descended from Austronesians who migrated to the islands 4,000 years ago during the Neolithic period. They lived in fortified mountain areas called idjangs and drank sugar-cane wine, or palek. They also used gold as currency and produced a thriving agriculture-based industry. They were also seafarers and boat-builders.

In 1687, a crew of English freebooters headed by William Dampier came with a Dutch crew and named the islands in honour of their country's nobility. Itbayat was named ""Orange Isle"" after William of Orange, and Batan was named ""Grafton Isle"" after Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton. Sabtang Isle was named ""Monmouth Isle"" after James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. Capt. Dampier stayed for less than three months, and did not claim the islands for the British crown.

In 1783, the Spanish claimed Batanes as part of the Philippines under the auspices of Governor-General José Basco y Vargas. The Bashi Channel was increasingly used by English East India Company ships and the Spanish authorities brought the islands under their direct administration to prevent them falling under British control. The Ivatan remained on their idjangs, or mountain fortresses for some time. In 1790, Governor Guerrero  decreed that Ivatans were to live in the lowlands and leave their remote idjang. The mangpus, the indigenous Ivatan leader of the islands during that time, made a revolution against the Spaniards afterwards. With much ammunition and steel armors, the Spanish authorities quelled the uprising, effectively subjugating the rebels. Basco and Ivana were the first towns established under full Spanish control. Mahatao was then administered by Basco, while Uyugan and Sabtang, by Ivana. Itbayat was not organized until the 1850s, its coast being a ridge. Soon, Ilocanos came to the islands and integrated with the local population. Roads, ports, bridges, churches and government buildings were built in this time. Limestone technology used by the Spanish was also spread to the islands, making bridges strong and fortified. Some of these bridges still remain at Ivana and Mahatao. By 1890, many Ivatans were in Manila, and became ilustrados, who then brought home with them the revolutionary ideas of the Katipunan. These Ivatans, who were then discontented with Spanish rule, killed the ruling General Fortea and declared the end of Spanish rule.

Toward the end of the Spanish administration, Batanes was made a part of Cagayan. In 1909, the new American authorities organized it into an independent province. During the American colonial period, additional public schools were constructed and more Ivatan became aware of their place in the Philippines. In 1920, the first wireless telegraph was installed, followed by an airfield in 1930. New roads were constructed and the Batanes High School was instituted.

Because of their strategic location, the islands was one of the first points occupied by invading Japanese imperial forces at the outbreak of the Pacific War. The morning of December 8, 1941, the Batan Task Force from Taiwan landed on the Batan Islands, which became the first American territory occupied by the Japanese. The purpose of the invasion was to secure the existing small airfield outside Basco, which was accomplished without resistance. Japanese fighters from Basco took part in the raid on Clark Air Base the following day. However, over the next several days, the success of the Japanese bombing of Clark Field rendered a base at Basco unnecessary, and on December 10, 1941, the naval combat force was withdrawn to participate in the invasion of Camiguin.

One of the first School Superintendents on Batan was Victor de Padua, an Ilocano, who in 1942–45 during the Japanese occupation was made Provincial Governor. Early in 1945 the island was liberated by the Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 1st and 12th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army. In 1984, Pacita Abad, the foremost Ivatan visual artist, became the first woman to be awarded the Ten Outstanding Young Men (TOYM) award, breaking 25 years of male dominance. In her acceptance speech, she said, ""it was long overdue that Filipina women were recognized, as the Philippines was full of outstanding women” and referred proudly to her mother.

In 1993, the Batanes Protected Landscape and Seascape, which encompassed the entire province, was listed in the Tentative List of the Philippines for UNESCO World Heritage Site inscription in the future. In 1997, the Indigenous Peoples Rights act or IPRA was passed in Philippine Congress. the law paved the way for the indigenous territorial rights of the Ivatans. The province has since promoted its Ivatan roots. Part of the Ilocano population has returned to mainland Luzon. In December 7, 2004, Pacita Abad died after finishing her last international art work while suffering from cancer.

Geography

The province has a total area of  comprising ten islands situated within the Luzon Strait between the Balintang Channel and Taiwan. The islands are sparsely populated and subject to frequent typhoons. The three largest islands, Batan, Itbayat, and Sabtang, are the only inhabited islands.

The northernmost island in the province, also the northernmost land in the entire Philippines, is Mavulis (or Y'ami) Island. Other islands in the chain are Misanga (or North), Ditarem, Siayan, Diogo (or Dinem), Ivuhos, and Dequey. The islands are part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc.

Topography
Almost one-half of Batanes is hills and mountains. Batan Island is generally mountainous on the north and southeast. It has a basin in the interior. Itbayat Island slopes gradually to the west, being mountainous and hilly along its northern, eastern coast. As for Sabtang, mountains cover the central part, making the island slope outward to the coast.

The islands are situated between the vast expanse of the waters of Bashi Channel and Balintang Channel, where the Pacific Ocean merges with the China Sea. The area is a sea lane between the Philippines and Japan, China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. It is rich with marine resources, including the rarest sea corals in the world.

The province is hilly and mountainous, with only 1,631.5 hectares or 7.1% of its area level to undulating, and 78.2% or 17,994.4 hectares varying from rolling to steep and very steep. Forty two percent (42%) or 9,734.40 hectares are steep to very steep land. Because of the terrain of the province, drainage is good and prolonged flooding is non-existent. The main island of Batan has the largest share of level and nearly level lands, followed by Itbayat and Sabtang, respectively. Itbayat has gently rolling hills and nearly level areas on semi-plateaus surrounded by continuous massive cliffs rising from  above sea level, with no shorelines. Sabtang has its small flat areas spread sporadically on its coasts, while its interior is dominated by steep mountains and deep canyons. Batan Island and Sabtang have intermittent stretches of sandy beaches and rocky shorelines.

The terrain of the province, while picturesque at almost every turn, has limited the potential for expansion of agriculture in an already very small province.

Climate
Batanes has a tropical climate (Köppen climate classification Am). The average yearly temperature is , and the average monthly temperature ranges from  in January to  in July, similar to that of Southern Taiwan. Precipitation is abundant throughout the year; the rainiest month is August while the driest month is April. November to February are the coldest months. There is a misconception that Batanes is constantly battered by typhoons. Batanes is mentioned frequently in connection with typhoons, because it holds the northernmost weather station in the Philippines, thus, it is also a reference point for all typhoons that enter the Philippine area; however, in September 2016, Typhoon Meranti impacted the entire province, including a landfall on Itbayat.

Administrative divisions
Batanes is subdivided into 6 municipalities, all encompassed by a lone congressional district.

Barangays
The 6 municipalities of the province comprise a total of 29 barangays, with Ihuvok II in Basco as the most populous in 2010, and Nakanmuan in Sabtang as the least.

Demographics

The population of Batanes in the  was  people, with a density of .

The natives are called Ivatans and share prehistoric cultural and linguistic commonalities with the Babuyan on Babuyan Island and the Tao people of Orchid Island.

This divided homeland is a result of the Dutch invasion of Taiwan in 1624 (Dutch Formosa) and Spanish invasion in 1626 (Spanish Formosa). The northern half of the Ivatan homeland, Formosa and Orchid Island which were formally part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, fell to the Dutch who were in turn expelled in 1662 by forces of the Chinese Southern Ming dynasty, led by the Chinese pirate Koxinga who then set himself up as The King of Taiwan.

The southern half of the Ivatan homeland, the islands of Batanes, was reinforced and fortified by Spanish refugees from Formosa before being formally joined in the 18th century with the Spanish government in Manila.

The main languages spoken in Batanes are Ivatan, which is spoken on the islands of Batan and Sabtang; Itbayaten, which is spoken primarily on the island of Itbayat. The Ivatan which is dominant in the province is considered to be one of the Austronesian languages. From college level down to elementary level, the language is widely spoken.

Religion
The large majority (94%) of the island's people adhere to Roman Catholicism. The remaining faiths are other Christian Churches.

Ecology

An extensive survey of the ecology of Batanes provided the scientific basis for confirming the need for a national park in Batanes protecting the Batanes protected landscapes and seascapes, proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, submitted on 15 August 1993. An effort is underway to declare the whole province, along with the sugar central sites in Negros, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site by the end of 2020.

Flora and fauna
The province is the home of the unique conifer species Podocarpus costalis. Although it is reportedly growing in some other places such as coasts of Luzon, Catanduanes and even Taiwan, full blossoming and fruiting are observed only in Batanes. Its fruiting capacity on the island remains a mystery but is likely due to several factors such as climate, soil and type of substratum of the island.

Several species of birds, bats, reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the island; many of those are endemic to the Philippines. The island is also a sanctuary of different migratory birds during winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

Economy

About 75% of the Ivatans are farmers and fishermen. The rest are employed in the government and services sector. Garlic and cattle are major cash crops. Ivatans also plant camote (sweet potato), cassava, gabi or tuber and a unique variety of white uvi. Sugarcane is raised to produce palek, a kind of native wine, and vinegar.

In recent years, fish catch has declined due to the absence of technical know-how. Employment opportunities are scarce. Most of the educated Ivatans have migrated to urban centers or have gone abroad.

A wind diesel generating plant was commissioned in 2004.

Distance and bad weather work against its economic growth. Certain commodities like rice, soft drinks, and gasoline carry a 75% to 100% mark-up over Manila retail prices.

Transportation
The island province of Batanes is accessible by air via the Basco Airport and Itbayat Airport. There are 3 flights per week from Manila by SkyJetAir, and from Tuguegarao (Cagayan) by small local airliners (as of January 2013). PAL Express flies to Batanes every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday since May 1, 2013.

Values
The Ivatan people of Batanes are one of the most egalitarian societies in the Philippines. The prime motivator of the cultural values of the Ivatans are imbibed in their pre-colonial belief systems of respecting nature and all people. The Ivatans, both the older and younger generations, have one of the highest incidences of social acceptance to minority groups in the country. The Ivatans also have a high respect for the elderly and the prowess of natural phenomena such as waves, sea breeze, lightning, thunders, earthquakes, and wildlife congregations. Discriminating someone based on skin color, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, and traditions on nature is unacceptable in Ivatan values. Land grabbing is also a grave crime in Ivatan societies, making ancestral domain certification an important part of Ivatan jurisprudence since the enactment of the IPRA Law.

Heritage

Natural

Tapangkos or covering were also installed on the doors and windows of several buildings in Batanes, including the capitol building. During heavy storms it was also a time for bayanihan of the residents as they helped each other tie down roofs.

"Boyracer

Boyracer (sometimes styled Boyracer UK) was an English indie rock group from Wetherby.

History
Boyracer was founded by vocalist/guitarist Stewart Anderson in 1990 and released their first single in 1991. Richard Adams left the group in 1993, after which the group released its first EP, Naked. They then arranged to release further recordings via Sarah Records including two more EPs in 1993. Both James Chadwick and Simon Guild departed early in 1994, and Anderson put together a new line-up before releasing the group's debut full-length for Slumberland Records.

More lineup changes ensued in 1994 while the group continued to put out releases, with a number of 7 inch EPs and they toured the United States for the first time at the beginning of 1995. Later that year they signed with MCA subsidiary label Zero Hour Records. The label dropped them while they were doing a nationwide U.S. tour. They then released several singles on independent American labels over the course of 1996. Early in 1997, the group split up, but in 2000 Anderson reconstituted Boyracer with several new members and new material.

In 2010 the band played two shows in Los Angeles and San Francisco as part of the Slumberland Records 20th Anniversary showcase. The group played another show in Flagstaff, Arizona at the end of October 2011.

"Hermann Kelly

Hermann Patrick Kelly (born 1968) is an Irish journalist and political candidate who wrote for the Irish Mail on Sunday and is a former editor of The Irish Catholic. He has also written for The Sunday Times, Sunday Independent, Sunday Mirror, The Sunday Business Post and Magill magazine. In September 2018 he took part in the launch of the Irexit Freedom To Prosper Party.

Early life and education
Born in 1968, he was originally from the Bogside in Derry. His father was a headmaster of a school in Creggan, his mother was a nurse and he has three siblings.

He studied marine biology in Edinburgh before studying theology as a lay student at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.

Book

Kathy O'Beirne criticism
In 2007, Kelly wrote a book (Kathy's Real Story) disputing the claims made in a book by Kathy O'Beirne (Don't Ever Tell), in which O'Beirne described childhood abuse she had reputedly suffered in a Magdalene Asylum. He claimed that initial doubts that he had while reading her book were confirmed by inconsistencies in different accounts she had given, and later confirmed by various witnesses and documentary evidence. He also claimed that false allegations were being made by those appearing before the Residential Institutions Redress Board in order to receive compensation.

A review by Gene Kerrigan (who worked alongside Michael Sheridan - O'Beirne's co-author) criticised Kelly's own criticism of O'Beirne's book. Kelly and O'Beirne both appeared on Ireland AM to discuss their books in November 2007, and the encounter ended in an argument.

Kelly also wrote to the proposed publishers of a sequel by O'Beirne, sending them a copy of Kathy's Real Story and asking them not to publish. A Sunday Times article (26 July 2009) indicated that the publisher had withdrawn their initial offer to publish her book because of an 'unresolved legal issue'.

European Union politics
Kelly has worked with Nigel Farage, and was director of communications for Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD). The EFDD later dissolved as various MEPs left the group and constituent parties, some in disputes over political extremism.

Kelly, who is from Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom, supports the Republic of Ireland leaving the European Union (an 'Irexit'), and is the President of the Irish Freedom Party, a party that advocates the same position. He contested the 2019 European Parliament election in the Dublin constituency, receiving 2,441 (0.67%) first preference votes and was eliminated on the fourth count.

Political Views
Some outlets have linked Kelly with alt-right ideologies, pointing to a video which Kelly recorded with far-right British Loyalist and former British National Party member Jim Dowson. In the video Kelly endorsed the white nationalist ""grand replacement"" conspiracy theory. This followed a similar interview, in January 2019 with LifeSiteNews, in which Kelly denounced what he called the ""great replacement of our children"".

Kelly spoke at the Free Speech Rally, outside the Dail, on 16 November 2019.

"Soulstar

Soulstar is a hybrid rail shooter/third-person shooter video game developed and originally published by Core Design for the Sega CD in Europe on April 1994, then in North America by Time Warner Interactive on September 1994, and later in Japan by Victor Entertainment on December 22 of the same year as well.

When the ancient Myrkoids alien race arrive upon the titular solar system to drain its planets from their resources and destroy them, it is up to Bryk Hammelt of the Cryo-Commandos warrior race to eliminate the Myrkoids by piloting his morphing fighter craft named the Aggressor. As the penultimate title developed by Core Design for the Sega CD, Soulstar features heavy use of the scaling and rotation capabilities of the add-on, similar with other titles on the system created by the same developer such as Thunderhawk and Battlecorps, which featured the same pseudo-3D graphical style. It is inspired by Sega's 1988 arcade game Galaxy Force II.

Upon release, Soulstar received praise from critics for its technical achievement on the hardware, soundtrack and multiple playstyles, though it received criticism for the repetitive gameplay. Nevertheless, the game was named ""Best Shooter"" on the Sega CD by GameFan. Ports for the 32X, Atari Jaguar CD and PC were in development by Core Design, but they were never released.

Gameplay 

Soulstar is a shooter game that is primarily played in a third-person perspective behind the ship, similar to Galaxy Force II and Star Fox, where players take the role of Bryk Hammelt from the Cryo-Commandos in a mission to exterminate the alien race known as the Myrkoids, who have arrived on the titular Soulstar system to invade it. The gameplay is based around three types of space combat vehicles that the player's ship, the Aggressor, can transform into depending on the situation. 

The first mode is an on rails shoot 'em up akin to Space Harrier, where it involves flying the Sub-light Strike Craft through space towards huge scaling sprites of a planet or space station and flying across a texture mapped planetscape, while shooting upcoming enemies from either the front or behind and collecting power-ups along the way.

The second mode involves controlling the Turbo Copter hovercraft in environments of 360°, allowing players to roam freely across the map on missions that take place in indoor or outdoor areas. In this mode, players are tasked with eliminating primary targets within the area, which are displayed before the start of each level at the mission briefing screen. A notable feature of the game is how the difficulty level is selected: After entering the second level and destroying the boss of the area, there are three warp gates that players can activate, each one representing a fixed level of difficulty of the game (from Easy to Hard) and a set number of levels to go through. At the end of each level set, the player returns to the space station to choose a remaining warp gate.

The third mode is similar to the Turbo Copter mode in terms of gameplay, but this time players control the Combat Walker mecha, which is capable of dashing along the ground and hover above the terrain for a brief period of time. Each vehicle in the three gameplay modes offer a different control scheme and functions. The game also has a two-player cooperative mode, where the first player pilots the spaceship, while the second players acts as an air gunner aiming at the enemies.

Plot 
The Myrkoids, an ancient alien species with a cold and unified mind have descended upon many star systems, stealing and draining every planet of their resources and destroying them in the process. Following the destruction of his home system, Bryk Hammelt, the last from a noble warrior race known as the Cryo-Commandos, sets out in his morphing starship, the Aggressor, to hunt down and eradicate the Myrkoids from existence, who have arrived at the Soulstar system to repeat their same process of planetary extermination.

Development 

Soulstar was conceived by Mark Avory (now Sarah Jane Avory) after work on the Sega CD port of Thunderhawk was completed. Mark had the desire to develop a project similar to Galaxy Force II, as it was one of his favorite titles in arcades, but no existing hardware released at the time on the market was capable of producing visuals of similar fidelity until the arrival of the Sega CD in 1991, which allowed Mark and one of his co-workers to make their vision a reality. The project began development in March 1993, two months after Thunderhawk was released in North America on Sega CD and was announced in late 1993 under the original name Aggressor and later as Soulstar: Malice of The Myrkoids in early 1994, along with other then-upcoming titles for the add-on by Core Design such as Battlecorps, Heimdall and BC Racers (then titled Chuck Rally).

Soulstar makes intensive use of the features available on the Sega CD hardware for its visuals, in addition to being the first title on the add-on that displayed sprites at 64 colors. Mark and his team planned on pushing the hardware as much as they could from the beginning of its development, with all of the sprites featured in the game being built on the system's WRAM as ""stamp maps"" in order to be displayed on-screen by the Sega Genesis, in addition to creating a display list to showcase up to 80 moving sprites. Mark also integrated a graphical trick that allowed both the sprites and terrain to exhibit color depth-fading. The soundtrack composed by Nathan McCree was implemented early in development and enters synchronization with gameplay during the Sub-light Strike Craft sections. Both Battlecorps and Soulstar shared the same game engine as with Thunderhawk on the Sega CD.

The game was showcased during the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 1994, with early previews showing elements that are not present in the final release.

Release 
Soulstar was first released in Europe on April 1994, featuring the option of choosing between different languages for in-game options and text. The game was later brought to North America by Time Warner Interactive on September of the same year, with the language options being removed from this release. It was also published during the same year in Japan by Victor Entertainment on December 22, with all the in-game text left entirely in English.

Soulstar X 
A version of the game for the Sega 32X, titled Soulstar X, was in development by Core Design and announced in 1995. Originally planned for an April 1995 release and later planned to be launched on Autumn/August 1995, this version was set to feature improved gameplay and new weapons, in addition to sporting pre-rendered graphics and sprites at 256 colors that were created by using the Wavefront graphics software program found on Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstations, instead of the original hand-drawn look on Sega CD but it was ultimately never released due to the commercial failure of the add-on. On February 20, 2010, a ROM image of an early but playable prototype of Soulstar X for the 32X was leaked online by a video game collector at the SEGASaturno forums.

A port of Soulstar X to the PC was also planned and in development by Core Design, but never released.

Atari Jaguar CD version 

A port of Soulstar for the Atari Jaguar CD was also in development by Core Design and announced during the same time along with Soulstar X for the 32X. This version was set to feature the same pre-rendered sprites as with the 32X version but with reworked graphics compared to the Sega CD original, in addition to redone FMV sequences while retaining the same gameplay found on the original version, albeit at a faster frame rate. In a February 1995 interview by Atari Explorer Online with former Core Design employee Andrew Smith, he stated that work on the port was almost finished but not without the team coming across with issues found within the system's multi-chip architecture, in order to meet a strict time limit for completion. Andrew also stated that they were open with the idea of porting the title to the Atari Jaguar, but suggesting that some elements would need to be omitted for a possible cartridge release, and that the idea would also need to be proven viable for Atari Corporation. It was first shown during Spring ECTS '95 and was originally planned for a Q2 1995 release.

Soulstar for the Jaguar CD was then showcased during E3 1995 along with Soulstar X, and now planned for an August/Q3 1995 release. Though internal documents from Atari Corp. listed the port as in development and later advertised to be launched in late 1995, the port was ultimately never released with no explanation given in regards to its cancellation. Although Andrew Smith stated that the company did have some titles from their catalog listed to be converted for the Jaguar, with Susan Lusty of Core Design stating at WCES '95 that both Swagman and Tomb Raider were planned to be released for the add-on, Core's PR manager Susie Hamilton later clarified in 1999 that Soulstar was their only title in development for the platform.

An ISO image of a playable build of the Jaguar CD version was leaked sometime online, but gameplay is very prone to glitches and game-crashing bugs. A bootleg copy of this version was seen running at the fan festival Jaguar Connexion 2005. In recent years, video game collector and community member Matt Smith has uploaded a full playthrough from an almost complete build of the Jaguar CD version on YouTube, with plans to be released online for download in the future.

Reception

Pre-release 
In their April 1994 issue, Electronic Gaming Monthly gave a positive remark to the game by stating that ""Fans of the Galaxy Force series of games will be pleased to see the creation of this great looking CD!"". Dave Halverson of GameFan also gave positive remarks to the title, stating ""If you've been waiting for another great shooter for your Sega CD, better dust it off. Soul Star is coming"". GamePro gave a positive remark to the game as well when it was showcased at WCES '94, praising the graphics, music and variety.

Post-release 

Soulstar received upon release. GamePro gave the game a mixed review, saying that the graphics and audio are impressive, but that ""the interstellar flying, which dominates the game, makes you feel like you're confined to a tight, invisible box - a drawback for Mode 7 fans."" They also commented that the steep difficulty curve makes the game unsuitable for novice gamers.

"Katherine Plouffe

Katherine Plouffe (born September 15, 1992) is a Canadian basketball player for Tango Bourges Basket and the Canadian national team, where she participated at the 2014 FIBA World Championship.

She is the daughter of Laurie and Daryl Plouffe. She has four siblings; her twin sister, Michelle, played basketball for the University of Utah located in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, and her older sister, Andrea, played basketball at the University of Washington located in Seattle, Washington.

Early years
Plouffe first started playing basketball in the second grade. She had older siblings who were often in the gym. She enjoyed being in the gym with her older siblings so she picked up the game at a young age.

Pan Am games 2015
Plouffe was a member of the Canada women's national basketball team which participated in basketball at the 2015 Pan American Games held in Toronto, Ontario July 10 to 26, 2015. Canada opened the preliminary rounds with an easy 101–38 win over Venezuela. The following day they beat Argentina 73–58. The final preliminary game was against Cuba; both teams were 2–0, so the winner would win the group. The game went down to the wire with Canada eking out a 71–68 win. Canada would face Brazil in the semifinal.

Everything seemed to go right in the semifinal game. Canada opened the game with an 11–2 run on seven consecutive points by Miranda Ayim. Miah-Marie Langlois contributed five assists. In the third quarter Canada strongly out rebounded Brazil and hit 69% of their field goals to score 33 points in the quarter. Lizanne Murphy and Nirra Fields hit three-pointers to help extend the lead to 68–39 at the end of three quarters. Canada continued to dominate in the fourth quarter with three-pointers by Kia Nurse and Kim Gaucher. Canada went on to win the game 91–63 to earn a spot in the gold-medal game against the USA.

The gold-medal game matched up the host team Canada against USA, in a sold out arena dominated by fans in red and white and waving the Canadian flag. The Canadian team, arm in arm, sang O Canada as the respective national anthems were played.

After trading baskets early the US edged out to a double-digit lead in the second quarter. However the Canadians, spurred on by the home crowd cheering, fought back and tied up the game at halftime. In the third quarter, it was Canada's time to shine as they outscore the US 26–15. The lead would reach as high as 18 points. The USA would fight back, but not all the way and Canada won the game and the gold-medal 81–73. It was Canada's first gold-medal in basketball in the Pan Am games. Nurse was the star for Canada with 33 points, hitting 11 of her 12 free-throw attempts in 10 of her 17 field-goal attempts including two of three three-pointers. Plouffe contributed two rebounds, one block and two points.

"Vitamins (short story)

""Vitamins"" is a short story by American author Raymond Carver. It was originally published in 1984, in his collection titled Cathedral.

Plot synopsis 

""Vitamins"" begins with an unnamed male narrator telling the story of how his wife starts a home business selling vitamins. His wife Patti starts selling vitamins because she wants a job for her self-respect. Patti takes her job very seriously and she feels hurt when girls quit on her. One night one of her employees, a girl named Sheila makes a pass at Patti by telling her she loves Patti. Then she grabs Patti’s breast. Patti tells her she ""doesn’t swing that way"", but says that she loves Sheila, just not in the way Sheila loves her.

After that incident, the narrator describes a party that he and Patti hold for all of Patti’s employees. The vitamin business was not doing as well as before so Patti holds a party to cheer all her employees up. All the girls are dancing with other girls, but the narrator dances with a girl named Donna. Sheila is the first person to get drunk and pass out. The narrator and Patti move Sheila’s sleeping body out onto the porch and they forget about her. The party winds down and the narrator makes attempts to have sex with Donna. Donna tells him not now and she leaves the party. Sheila wakes up and walks into the house. After complaining, she asks the narrator where Patti is and that Patti has to take her to the hospital. The narrator says that Patti is asleep and he kicks Sheila out of the house. The next morning Patti asks the narrator where Sheila is and he tells her that she went to Portland. Patti complains of dreaming of vitamins and that her life is becoming consumed by vitamins.

A couple of days after the party the narrator invites Donna to a bar called the Off-Broadway for a drink. He describes it as a ""spade"" bar. While there, a man named Benny approaches them. Benny walks over with his friend Nelson, a veteran of Vietnam who has just arrived home. Nelson jokes about how Donna and the narrator are not married and that they must be good friends. To tease them, he pulls out a box with a cut off ear from a Vietnamese soldier. Khaki, the owner of the bar walks over asks if everything is alright. Benny assures him that everything is fine. Nelson then offers Donna a couple hundred dollars to 'french' him (perform oral sex). The narrator and Donna leave, disgusted. While in his car, Donna remarks that she could have used the money and that she is deciding to leave for Portland.

The narrator returns home. He pours himself a glass of Scotch and he takes it into his bathroom. Patti wakes up and runs into the bathroom, fully clothed. She yells at the narrator saying that he let her oversleep and that she has to get to work to sell vitamins. The narrator tells her to go back to sleep. The story ends with the narrator commenting that all the medicine was falling out of the medicine cabinet.

Themes 

Alcohol plays a part in all of the situations with the characters. Alcohol is seen to have negative effect on the lives of all of the characters. Especially with the character of Sheila who passes out on the porch during the party. When the narrator takes Donna to the spade bar, the alcohol plays a part in the scene by setting the tone of the scene as being ""underground"".

The Vitamins can also be interpreted as being metaphors for alcohol. The narrator is seen to be drinking alcohol throughout the story and the vitamins may represent the negative effects played out in the life of his wife, Patti. Patti constantly thinks about vitamins in much the way that an alcoholic thinks about drinking. Patti confides to the narrator that she feels suffocated by vitamins, and that she wants to escape from vitamins. These feelings are similar to ones that an alcoholic feels and in the end, the vitamins are seen to be destroying the marriage.

"Cape serotine

The Cape serotine (Neoromicia capensis) is a species of vesper bat occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa. 'Serotine' is from Latin 'serotinus' meaning ‘of the evening'.

It is found in Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and possibly Djibouti.

Habitat and ecology
Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, dry savanna, and moist savanna, grassland, bushveld and Acacia woodland, and though recorded from more arid areas is absent from desert regions.

Animals roost in small groups of up to about 20 individuals, under the bark of trees, in hollow trees, in cracks in walls and under the eaves and roofs of houses whether thatched, tiled or covered in corrugated iron. Being unobtrusive, their presence is mostly unnoticed. They will readily occupy a bat house.

Small, brownish in colour with a greyish underbelly, and relatively untidy fur. Its colour is quite variable depending on the region where it occurs. Small snout and mouth, with a dome-shaped forehead. Wing membranes are dark in colour with a forearm length of some 29–38 mm with a small wingspan. Weight is between 4-10 grams. Its flying behaviour when foraging appears to be quite playful.
 
They give birth once a year to from 1-4 young between October and November. Food items include beetles, lacewings, moths, mosquitoes, plant-sucking bugs and a variety of other flying insects.

The genome of a close relative of human Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus has been found in a specimen of Neoromicia (Pipistrellus) capensis (previously erroneously assumed to be N. zuluensis).

"John III of Navarre

John III (; 1469 – 14 June 1516) was jure uxoris King of Navarre from 1484 until his death, as husband and co-ruler with Queen Catherine.

He was a son of Alain I, Lord of Albret and his wife Frances, Countess of Périgord.

King of Navarre

Marriage to Queen Catherine and accession to the throne
He became King of Navarre and Count of Foix by virtue of his 1484 marriage to Queen Catherine (1470–1517), successor of her brother Francis Phoebus in 1483. He shared with Catherine tasks related to the government of the kingdom, but his rule was marked by the guardianship of Catherine's mother Magdalena de Valois up to 1494—she died in 1495—and persistent diplomatic and military pressure of Ferdinand II of Aragon over the Crown of Navarre, supported on the ground by the Beaumont party of Navarre.

He and Catherine were crowned as monarchs in Pamplona on 10 January 1494. In the run-up to the ceremony, Louis of Beaumont—count of Lerín—had taken over and ransacked the stronghold. On Christmas 1493, the count blocked the access of the king and queen to the capital city, but after a fleeting peace agreement was reached, the ceremony was held. In the week-long festival following the crowning ceremony, John III and his father are referred to in Basque language verses as Labrit, their usual naming in Navarre—also at Olite in 1493, document written in Romanic language.

The kingdom invaded
In 1512, Navarre was invaded by a combined Castilian-Aragonese army sent by Ferdinand II of Aragon, whose second wife was Germaine de Foix (1490–1538), a cousin of Queen Catherine. The Castilian troops commanded by the duke of Alba crossed the Pyrénées onto Lower Navarre capturing St-Jean-Pied-de-Port on 10 September 1512 and wreaking havoc across much of the merindad. There the Castilians were doggedly opposed by lords loyal to John III and Catherine of Navarre, but the Castilians retained St-Jean-Pied-de-Port and its hinterland. Following the invasion, Navarre south of the Pyrenees was annexed to Castile nominally as an autonomous kingdom (aeque principalis) by the victorious Ferdinand after taking an oath to respect the Navarrese laws and institutions (1515).

The royal family took shelter in Béarn, a royal Pyrenean domain and principality contiguous to Lower Navarre. The Parliament of Navarre and the States-General of Béarn had passed in 1510 a bill to create a confederation with a view to ensuring a better defence against external aggression. The capital city of Béarn was Pau, which John III and Catherine took as their main base along with Orthez and Tarbes in their last period.

Reconquest attempt and death
After the Aragonese king Ferdinand's death in January 1516, the king John III mustered an army in Sauveterre-de-Béarn made up of Navarrese exiles and men from all over his domains, especially from Béarn, but the total figure of combatants amounted to no more than several hundreds. The advance of the two columns led by Pedro, Marshal of Navarre was stopped by the Castilians right on the Pyrénées due to spies informing Cardinal Cisneros. The reconquest attempt was flawed.

Depressed by the defeats and adverse diplomatic results, John III died at the castle of Esgouarrabaque in Monein, Béarn, on 14 June 1516 after lying gripped by fatal fevers. Up to the last moment he struggled to get Navarre back from the Spanish, urging his wife, Queen Catherine, to send a representative to the Cortes of Castile to demand the restoration of the kingdom of Navarre. Despite his wish to be buried at the Santa Maria Cathedral of Pamplona, the permanent Spanish occupation prevented that. His corpse rests instead at the Cathedral of Lescar along with Queen Catherine, who outlived him only a few months.

Family
John was the brother of Charlotte of Albret.

He and Queen Catherine of Navarre were parents to thirteen children—other sources point to fourteen:
Anne (19 May 1492 – 15 August 1532)
Magdalena (29 March 1494 – May 1504)
Catherine (1495 – November 1532), abbess of the Trinity at Caen
Joan (15 June 1496 – last mentioned in November 1496)
Quiteria (1499 – September/October 1536), abbess at Montivilliers
a stillborn son in 1500
Andrew Phoebus (14 October 1501 – 17 April 1503)
Henry II (18 April 1503 – 25 May 1555), King of Navarre 
Buenaventura (14 July 1505 – 1510/1511)
Martin (c. 1506 – last mentioned in 1512)
Francis (1508 – last mentioned in 1512)
Charles (12 December 1510 – September 1528), captured during the Siege of Naples and died as a prisoner of war
Isabella (1513/1514 – last mentioned in 1555), married to Rene I, Viscount of Rohan

"Secularism in Egypt

Secularism in Egypt has had a very important role to play in both the history of Egypt and that of the Middle East. Egypt’s first experience of Secularism started with the British Occupation (1882–1952), the atmosphere which allowed the protection of debate. In this environment pro-secularist intellectuals like Ya'qub Sarruf, Faris Nimr, Nicola Haddad whom sought political asylum from Ottoman Rule were able to publish their work. This debate had then became a burning issue with the work of Egyptian Shaykh Ali Abdel Raziq (1888–1966), “The most momentous document in the crucial intellectual and religious debate of modern Islamic history” 

By 1919 Egypt had its first political secular entity called the Hizb 'Almani (Secular Party) - this name was later changed to the Wafd Party. It combined secular policies with a nationalist agenda and had the majority support in the following years against both the rule of the king and the British influence. The Wafd party supported the allies during World War II and then proceeded to win the 1952 parliamentary elections. Following these elections, the prime minister was overthrown by the King leading to riots. These riots precipitated a military coup after which all political parties were banned including the Wafd Party and the Muslim Brotherhood. The government of Gamal Abdel Nasser was secularist-nationalist in nature which at the time gathers a great deal of support both in Egypt and other Arab states.

Key elements of Nasserism:
Secularist/Nationalist dictatorship; No religious or other political movements allowed to impact government
Modernization
Industrialization
Concentration on Arab values rather than Muslim values

Following the death of Nasser, President Anwar Sadat (1970–1981) continued economic liberalization and maintained the government's secularist policy, even going as far as signing peace agreements with Israel which was a first for any Middle Eastern country. However, following further intensive clampdowns on political opposition, Sadat was assassinated and replaced by Hosni Mubarak who again faces the issue of keeping the Islamist support at bay whilst keeping his power base during increased pressure to be democratic. Nowadays, most proponents of secularism emphasize the link between secularism and ‘national unity’ between Coptic Christians and Muslims.

Following the Egyptian revolution of 2011 as part of the regional Arab Spring protests, Mubarak was ousted and the following year Mohamed Morsi who is backed by the Muslim Brotherhood won Egypt's first democractic elections. In 2013 Morsi was removed from power in a coup led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Sisi has called for religious tolerance and has cracked down and banned the Muslim Brotherhood. He has closed thousands of mosques and has banned 'burkinis' on some beaches. A The Economist report in 2017 stated that Egyptians were turning more secular again, with supporters of sharia law dropping by more than half since 2011, people praying less than before, and gender equality now being widely accepted. The government has also acted to preserve its Jewish heritage through the restoration of the abandoned Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue in Alexandria in 2017.

"Payload Assist Module

The Payload Assist Module (PAM) is a modular upper stage designed and built by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing), using Thiokol Star-series solid propellant rocket motors. The PAM was used with the Space Shuttle, Delta, and Titan launchers and carried satellites from low Earth orbit to a geostationary transfer orbit or an interplanetary course. The payload was spin stabilized by being mounted on a rotating plate.  Originally developed for the Space Shuttle, different versions of the PAM were developed:
 PAM-A (Atlas class), development terminated; originally to be used on both the Atlas and Space Shuttle
 PAM-D (Delta class), uses a Star-48B rocket motor
 PAM-DII (Delta class), uses a Star-63 rocket motor
 PAM-S (Special) as a kick motor for the space probe Ulysses

The PAM-D module, used as the third stage of the Delta II rocket, was the last version in use. As of 2018, no PAM is in active use on any rockets.

2001 re-entry incident 
On January 12, 2001, a PAM-D module re-entered the atmosphere after a ""catastrophic orbital decay"". The PAM-D stage, which had been used to launch the GPS satellite 2A-11 in 1993, crashed in the sparsely populated Saudi Arabian desert, where it was positively identified.

"Ree Drummond

Ann Marie ""Ree"" Drummond (née Smith, born January 6, 1969) is an American blogger, author, food writer, photographer and television personality who lives on a working ranch outside of Pawhuska, Oklahoma. In February 2010, she was listed as No. 22 on Forbes' Top 25 Web Celebrities. Her blog, The Pioneer Woman, which documents Drummond's daily life as a ranch wife and mother, was named Weblog of the Year 2009, 2010 and 2011 at the Annual Weblog Awards (The Bloggies).

Capitalizing on the success of her blog, Drummond currently stars in her own television program, also entitled The Pioneer Woman, on The Food Network which began in 2011. She has also appeared on Good Morning America, Today Show, The View, The Chew and The Bonnie Hunt Show. She has been featured in Ladies' Home Journal, Woman's Day, People and Southern Living. Her first cookbook, The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Recipes from an Accidental Country Girl, was published in October 2009. Her second cookbook, The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Food from My Frontier, was published in March 2012.

Early life
Anne Marie, nicknamed Ree, grew up in a home overlooking the grounds of a country club in the oil town of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, with two brothers, Doug and Mike, and a younger sister, Betsy. She graduated from Bartlesville High School in 1987 after which she left Oklahoma to attend college in Los Angeles, California. She graduated from the University of Southern California in 1991, having first studied journalism before switching to gerontology. After graduation she hoped to attend law school in Chicago, but her plans changed unexpectedly when she met and married her husband, Ladd Drummond.

Her father, William Dale Smith, an orthopedic surgeon, and her mother Gerre Schwert are divorced. ""Bill"" Smith, as he is more commonly known, later married his current wife, Patsy.

Drummond was raised Episcopalian. She is an alumna of Pi Beta Phi fraternity for women.

Blog (ThePioneerWoman.com)
Drummond began blogging in May 2006, initially using the subdomain pioneerwoman.typepad.com within the Typepad blogging service. She registered her own domain – thepioneerwoman.com – on October 18, 2006.

Drummond's blog, titled The Pioneer Woman, was originally titled Confessions of a Pioneer Woman. The latter is now the title of a section within the site. The site is hosted by Rackspace.

Drummond writes about topics such as ranch life and homeschooling.  About a year after launching her blog, she posted her first recipe and a tutorial on ""How to Cook a Steak"". The tutorial was accompanied by 20 photos explaining the cooking process in what she calls ""ridiculous detail"".  Her stories about her husband, family, and country living, and her step-by-step cooking instructions and elaborate food photography, proved highly popular with readers.  Confessions of a Pioneer Woman won honors at the Weblog Awards (also known as the Bloggies) in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010. In 2009 and 2010 it took the top prize as Weblog of the Year.

As of September 2009, Drummond's blog reportedly received 13 million page views per month. On May 9, 2011, the blog's popularity had risen to approximately 23.3 million page views per month and 4.4 million unique visitors. According to an article in The New Yorker, ""This is roughly the same number of people who read The Daily Beast"". An article in the Toronto newspaper The Globe and Mail described it as ""[s]lickly photographed with legions of fans . . . arguably the mother of all farm girl blogs."" The blog has been referenced in the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and BusinessWeek.  In 2009 TIME Magazine named Drummond's Confessions of a Pioneer Woman one of the ""25 Best Blogs"" in the world. Estimates for her site's income suggest she is making a million dollars or more per year from display (advertisement) income alone.

Drummond's blog is especially noted for its visually descriptive recipes and high-quality photography.

Food community (TastyKitchen.com)
In April 2008, Drummond held a giveaway contest in the cooking section of her blog The Pioneer Woman in which she asked readers to share one of their favorite recipes.  The response was an unexpected 5,000+ recipes in less than 24 hours. She realized that she had not only grown a community of loyal readers but a community of food lovers as well. She immediately sought a way to catalog the recipes and make them searchable for all.

A little over a year later, on July 14, 2009, Drummond announced the launch of TastyKitchen.com – a simple and free online community website with the tagline Favorite Recipes from Real Kitchens Everywhere!.

The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Recipes from an Accidental Country Girl
Drummond's first cookbook, The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Recipes from an Accidental Country Girl, was published in October 2009 after reaching the top spot on Amazon.com's preorder list for hardcover books.  A New York Times reviewer described Drummond as ""funny, enthusiastic and self-deprecating"", and commented: ""Vegetarians and gourmands won’t find much to cook here, but as a portrait of a real American family kitchen, it works.""

Black Heels to Tractor Wheels
In 2007, Drummond began writing a series on her blog titled From Black Heels to Tractor Wheels. In the series, she chronicled her personal love story detailing how, in the process of relocating from Los Angeles to Chicago, she wound up settling down with a cowboy on a cattle ranch in rural Oklahoma. In February 2011, the series was compiled into a book and published by William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins. It quickly rose to No. 2 on both The New York Times Best Seller list for hardcover nonfiction and The Wall Street Journal's list.

Charlie the Ranch Dog
In April 2011, Drummond published a children's book titled Charlie the Ranch Dog, featuring her family's beloved Basset Hound Charlie. According to Publishers Weekly, “Adult readers will recognize in Charlie’s voice the understated humor that has made Drummond’s blog so successful; kids should find it irresistible.” The book was illustrated by Diane deGroat, an illustrator of more than 120 children's books.

Television
Drummond made her television debut on an episode of Throwdown! with Bobby Flay  when the celebrity chef was challenged by her (in a change from the show's normal format) to a special Thanksgiving face-off. Flay traveled to her Oklahoma ranch for the event. The episode aired on the Food Network on Wednesday, November 17, 2010. Drummond's home cooking beat Flay's gourmet-style spread in a tight contest. Music artist and fellow Oklahoma resident Trisha Yearwood was one of the judges.

In April 2011, the Food Network announced that Drummond would host her own daytime television series on the network. The Pioneer Woman premiered on Saturday, August 27, 2011.

Film
On March 19, 2010, Drummond confirmed media reports that Columbia Pictures had acquired the film rights to her book From Black Heels to Tractor Wheels. The production company was reported to be in talks with Reese Witherspoon to star as Drummond in a motion picture based on the book. However as of 2019, the movie  has stalled with the project landing in development hell.

Personal life
On September 21, 1996, Drummond married Ladd Drummond, a fourth-generation member of a prominent Osage County cattle ranching family whom she refers to as ""the Marlboro Man"" in her books and her blog. They spent their honeymoon in Australia and live on a remote working cattle ranch approximately 8 miles west of Pawhuska, Oklahoma.  They have four children – Alex, Paige, Bryce and Todd. Alex is a graduate of Texas A&M University, while Paige is currently a sophomore at the University of Arkansas. The Drummonds homeschool their sons in parts of the summer.

In late 2016, the Drummonds opened The Mercantile, a restaurant retail store located in a 100-year-old downtown Pawhuska building that they bought and began renovating in 2012.

In April 2018 the Drummonds also opened a bed and breakfast, called ""The Pioneer Woman Bed and Breakfast"".

"Daniel Garodnick

Daniel Garodnick (born May 5, 1972) is an American lawyer and a former Democratic New York City Councilmember. He is the president and chief executive officer of the Riverside Park Conservancy.

Early life and education
Garodnick was born in New York City and is a graduate of Trinity School (1990). He received his B.A. from Dartmouth College (1994) where he served as class president for each of his four years. He earned a J.D. from the University of Pennsylvania Law School (2000), where he was Editor-in-Chief of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review.

Between college and law school, Garodnick spent time in both Millen, Georgia and Portsmouth, Virginia helping to rebuild African American churches that had been burned by arson. He also spent two years working for the New York Civil Rights Coalition as the director of a program to teach New York City public school ways to combat racial discrimination, and how to use government to effect social change.

Career
An attorney, Garodnick practiced as a litigator at the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison where he focused on securities litigation and internal investigations of companies. While there, he represented the Partnership for New York City in the successful Campaign for Fiscal Equity lawsuit regarding public school funding.

Prior to joining the firm, he served as a law clerk to Judge Colleen McMahon of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. He spent two years working for the New York Civil Rights Coalition.

Personal life
In May 2008, Garodnick married Zoe Segal-Reichlin, senior associate general counsel and director of advocacy of Planned Parenthood. They have two children.

New York City Council
Garodnick was elected to New York City Council in 2005, winning 63 percent of the vote in the general election and defeating both the Republican and Libertarian candidates. In the five-way Democratic primary that year he won 59% of the vote. He won reelection in 2009 and 2013.

During his twelve-year tenure, The New York Times praised Garodnick for his “independent streak” and noted that he had “distinguished himself in the fight to preserve middle-class housing.” The Wall Street Journal has called him “smart and fair” and POLITICO New York noted that he is known as a “policy wonk” who has “bucked the establishment.""

In 2017, City & State called Garodnick a “no-nonsense negotiator.” Garodnick earned this reputation for repeatedly bringing parties to an agreement in difficult negotiations. In 2007, Garodnick successfully stepped in to broker an agreement between renowned Chef Daniel Boulud and the staff at his eponymous restaurant, who sought redress and compensation after Asian and Latino employees had been discriminated against and passed over for promotions. In 2008, when a developer proposed rezoning the largest stretch of undeveloped, privately owned land in Manhattan, Garodnick was able to adjust the plan to reduce the height of the towers, provide for acres of gardens and a school, as well as a $10 million contribution from the developer for a pedestrian bridge over the FDR Drive. In 2015, when the de Blasio administration and Council Member Carlos Menchaca were at a logjam over the $115 million redevelopment of the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, Garodnick helped broker an agreement between both sides.

Garodnick is best known for his work fighting for his childhood home in Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, where he spearheaded the largest housing preservation deal in New York City history in 2015, with 5,000 units for middle-class families. He also negotiated the East Midtown Rezoning in 2017, covering an 80 block area in midtown Manhattan, which is expected to generate new commercial space, and to deliver significant public improvements to the area.

Garodnick's last term as councilman ended on December 31, 2017, when he was succeeded by Keith Powers.

Garodnick authored and passed over 60 laws during his tenure on the New York City Council.

New York City Comptroller campaign
On April 3, 2012 Garodnick announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for New York City Comptroller. On November 28, 2012 Garodnick dropped out of the Comptroller race, and immediately endorsed Scott Stringer, while pledging to run for re-election in District 4. Stringer had previously been running for Mayor. Garodnick was opposed in his bid for re-election by attorney Helene Jnane.

"Lynae Larson

Lynae Larson is an American former marathon runner, who won the 1978 Chicago Marathon. She failed to qualify for the 1976 Summer Olympics.

Personal life and early career
Larson was born in 1953 and studied at Dickinson State College, where she began running. In her sophomore year, Larson set four meeting records at the North Dakota Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women event. She set records in the 440-yard run, long jump, 200-meter low hurdles, and the 880-yard run. In 1975, Larson won the long jump, 50 metres hurdles, 880-yard run and 1-mile run events at the same competition, and set a meeting record in the mile run. From 1976 to 1977, Larson was the coach of the Dickinson State girl's track and field team. The following year, Larson was a high school gym teacher in Brookings, South Dakota. In 2002, Larson worked as a schoolteacher in Saint Paul, Minnesota. She also worked as Women's Athletics Director at Dickinson State College.

Career
Larson failed to qualify for the marathon event at the 1976 Summer Olympics, after withdrawing  into the qualification event due to an injury.

Larson won the 1978 Chicago Marathon, in a time of 2:59:25. She received no prize money, as the event only began awarding prize money in 1982. After the race, other runners were complaining about the 10:30 start, which had most runners finishing in  heat, but Larson instead was concerned that the delayed start time affected her travel home, as she had to drive six hours back to Brookings, South Dakota, to work the next day. A race sponsor said the start time had been chosen to accommodate all entrants who lived outside the city.

Larson competed at the 1979 Chicago Marathon, and was leading until around  from the finish line, when she was overtaken by 15-year-old Laura Michalek. Larson eventually finished around a minute behind Michalek. In the same year, Larson won the second ever Lincoln Marathon, taking 31 minutes off the winning time from the previous year.

In 1984, Larson won the Kaypro Super Run in Las Vegas. The event was only for amateur athletes, one from each of the 50 states of the US. Larson qualified as amateur as she had not competed at the Olympics. The promised prize money was $500,000, awarded as $10,000 per year for 50 years. However Larson only received $40,000 as the sponsor went bust four years later. She was also promised five years of free travel with American Airlines as a prize, but only received two free trips. She also received a Rolex watch.

In 1994, Larson came second in her age category at the Get in Gear race in Minneapolis–Saint Paul. In 2006, Larson came seventh in her age category at a Minnesota Runners of the Year event.

"Battle of Finschhafen

The Battle of Finschhafen was part of the Huon Peninsula campaign during World War II and was fought between Australian and Japanese forces. The fighting took place between 22 September and 24 October 1943 following the landing at Scarlet Beach, which was followed by a two-pronged advance on Finschhafen as the Australian 20th Infantry Brigade advanced on the town from the north, while the 22nd Infantry Battalion drove from the south, having advanced from the landing beaches east of Lae. After the capture of Finschhafen, the Japanese forces in the area withdrew towards Sattelberg where they sought to hold the Australians before launching a counteroffensive, which subsequently threatened the landing beach. This attack was repelled by American and Australian forces, with heavy casualties being inflicted on the Japanese. In the aftermath, the Australians went on the offensive, capturing Sattelberg, and then advancing towards the Wareo plateau.

Background
Finschhafen had been occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army on 10 March 1942 as part of strategic moves to provide protection to Lae, which they had established as an important air base. Throughout early 1943, the Allies had begun offensive operations in the Salamaua area of New Guinea and following the landing at Nadzab and capture of Lae in early September 1943, the Allies attempted to exploit their success with an advance to Finschhafen to begin the Huon Peninsula campaign.

The operation to capture Finschhafen was important to capture the western cape of the Vitiaz Strait for the construction of airfields and naval facilities for the upcoming New Britain campaign as part of Operation Cartwheel. The responsibility for securing the Huon Peninsula was assigned to Major General George Wootten's Australian 9th Division. On 22 September, the Australian 20th Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier Victor Windeyer, supported by artillery from the 2/12th Field Regiment, as well as a field company of engineers and a field ambulance, had landed at Scarlet Beach – about  north of Finschhafen – and proceeded to establish a beachhead there. At the same time, the 22nd Infantry Battalion, an Australian Militia unit that had landed east of Lae in early September to relieve the troops holding the beachhead, began pursuing the Japanese that were withdrawing to the east, marching from Hopoi Mission Station towards Finschhafen, with a view to placing pressure on the Japanese southern flank.

The Japanese had expected an Allied assault on the Finschhafen region from around late July 1943, having appreciated its significance in relation to the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits. The Japanese Eighteenth Army commander, Lieutenant General Hatazo Adachi, had begun moving forces into the region. The majority of these were drawn from the 20th Division, which dispatched a force of about 2,800 men from Madang in August. These forces consisted of the 80th Infantry Regiment, one battalion of the 26th Field Artillery Regiment, and the 7th Naval Base Force. In addition, following the fall of Lae, elements of the 41st Division – primarily the 238th Infantry Regiment – and the 51st Division's 102nd Infantry Regiment, were also moved to the area, and were placed under the command of Major General Eizo Yamada, commander of the 1st Shipping Group. The total number of Japanese in the area was around 4,000 to 5,000, although Allied intelligence estimated a strength of between 350 and 2,100.

Yamada's forces were spread out in a series of outposts that were orientated around a main defensive position established at Sattelberg, an abandoned Lutheran mission situated atop a  mountain that dominated the terrain about  north-west of Finschhafen. The Japanese forces lacked transportation and the road network had not been fully developed. They were low on ammunition for all calibres of weapons, especially artillery, and the majority of stores had to be carried by combat troops, as local carriers had ceased working for the Japanese in response to Allied propaganda. Following the landing at Scarlet Beach, Yamada was ordered to launch an attack on the Australian forces in order to delay them so that further reinforcements could arrive from the 20th Division.

Battle

Australian drive on Finschhafen

After the landing, the Australians began establishing a beachhead several kilometres deep, during which significant actions were fought around Siki Cove and Katika. Late in the day, a large Japanese air raid struck the Allied fleet off shore, but this was eventually defeated by a strong US fighter umbrella that was forewarned by Allied picket ships. The following day, 23 September, the 20th Brigade's drive on Finschhafen began, with two battalions commencing the advance south – the  2/13th and 2/15th supported by the 2/12th Field Regiment as well as engineers from the 2/3rd Field Company  – while the 2/17th was split up, with two companies advancing as part of the brigade's reserve, while another remained to secure the beachhead from a Japanese attack and push it further to the north, and the fourth pushed towards Sattelberg. The 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion remained in the beachhead, working to improve roads, while the 2/8th Field Ambulance set up a main dressing station, which would receive casualties as they were evacuated rearwards from the advanced dressing station that was following the battalions advancing south.

In addition to having to split their forces, the Australians also suffered from supply difficulties during the advance. The terrain over the southerly approaches was quite difficult being primarily dense jungle with numerous water crossings and rugged features. To traverse the ground, the Australians had only limited vehicles, with each infantry battalion possessing four jeeps with trailers for resupply, while the engineers and artillery had several trucks and tractors. The local population, which might have been employed to carry stores, had abandoned the Japanese due to Allied propaganda and their services were also unavailable to the Allies at the initial stages of the campaign. As a result, a large amount of stores had to be carried by combat soldiers, who were diverted to the task. Nevertheless, the Australian advance succeeded in capturing the Heldsbach plantation and the nearby airfield. It continued until the Australians came up against strong resistance around the Bumi River. There a force of around 300 Japanese sailors and marines from the 85th Naval Garrison, reinforced by elements of the 238th Infantry Regiment, established themselves in a blocking position. Although they were under orders to conform to the overall Japanese plan of delaying the Australians and then withdrawing towards Sattelberg to carry out a containment operation, the commander of the naval troops resolved to hold the position, and they subsequently held up the Australian advance on 26 September, until they were overcome through an attack on their flanks by the 2/15th Infantry Battalion.

In response to concerns about the large number of Japanese forces in the area, which had proven to be in larger numbers than Allied intelligence had estimated, Windeyer requested reinforcements. These were initially refused as US naval commanders baulked at the idea of transporting another brigade to Finschhafen due to the risks involved and potential naval losses that might be incurred. In addition, the Allied higher headquarters under General Douglas MacArthur was operating under the mistaken belief that the Japanese defending the area were only very small in number, when in actuality the two forces were roughly equal in size, with the Allied strength after the landing being around 5,300. After much discussion amongst Australian and US commands on 29/30 September the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion arrived to relieve the 2/17th. The South Australians from the 2/43rd were subsequently tasked with defending the beachhead and the surrounding areas including the Heldsbach area, and were ordered to prepare for further actions around Sisi and Sattelberg. Heavy rain fell around this time, and the Australian brigade commander was compelled to use combat troops to carry stores forward from the landing zone to the forward areas as motor transport was unable to transit the primitive track system. Due to concerns about their western flank, the 2/17th extended the Australian perimeter towards Jivevaneng, establishing a company there, but it subsequently came under attack on the Sattelberg Road and west of Katika on 25 and 26 September from the Japanese 80th Infantry Regiment, which was trying to break through to the Heldsbach Plantation on the coast. Over the course of several days, the company from the 2/17th around Jivevaneng held off six Japanese attacks until relieved by the 2/43rd Infantry Battalion on 30 September.

Meanwhile, concerned about their rear, due to the presence of a large number of Japanese troops around Sattelberg, the Australians pushed cautiously to Kakakog, which saw heavy fighting at the end of the month, resulting in around 100 Japanese casualties as the Australians called in artillery fire and air attacks to soften up the Japanese defences prior to an attack by the 2/13th Infantry Battalion, supported by Vickers machine guns from the 2/15th. From the south, the 22nd Infantry Battalion advanced north against limited opposition. On 1 October, they crossed the Mape River adjacent to Langemak Bay, while the forward troops from the 20th Infantry Brigade, overwhelmed a Japanese force around Kakakog, supported by artillery and air power, killing between 80 and 100 defenders. Following this, the Japanese began withdrawing from Finschhafen and the next day, the 20th Infantry Brigade reached their objective, entering Finschhafen in the afternoon after overcoming limited resistance. The two forces married up the following day as troops from the 2/17th contacted the 22nd.

This ended the first phase of the battle. During operations to capture Finschhafen, the Australians lost 73 killed, 285 wounded. Sickness also resulted in a further 391 evacuations. Japanese casualties were reported as ""heavy"", but Allied intelligence assessed that a large number of Japanese forces remained at large and had withdrawn west away from the coast in preparation for further fighting. In the same time, US forces from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment lost eight killed and about 42 wounded, mainly during the landing operations around Scarlet Beach.

Japanese counterattack
Following the capture of Finschhafen, the main part of the Australian 20th Infantry Brigade returned to Scarlet Beach, due to intelligence that the Japanese were about to attack. The 2/13th and 22nd Infantry Battalions were left around Finschhafen, while the 2/15th and 2/17th Infantry Battalions were re-orientated to defend the approaches to Scarlet Beach. Around Jivevaneng,  east of Sattelberg, the 2/43rd had taken up a blocking position and in the early days of October fought a Japanese attack by a battalion from the 80th Infantry Regiment along the coast road to a halt. In an effort to shore up their western flank, the Australian 2/17th Infantry Battalion pressed towards Kumawa, which was met with a fierce response from the Japanese on 5 October when their line of communication from the west was threatened. The battalion continued to fight around Jivevaneng, and on 10 October they secured a piece of high ground called the ""Knoll"" by the Australians, who subsequently defeated 12 attacks to take it back.

On 10/11 October, as it became apparent to the Allies that Japanese were preparing for a major assault, Wootten and his headquarters landed at Finschhafen, along with the remainder of Brigadier Bernard Evans' 24th Infantry Brigade. That day, the bulk of the Japanese 20th Division, under Shigeru Katagiri, arrived in the area, as the size of the Japanese force facing the Australians increased to 12,000; nevertheless, Katagiri decided to hold off on launching his counterattack until stores and ammunition could be stockpiled in sufficient quantities. Meanwhile, the Australian 24th Infantry Brigade was subsequently given responsibility for defence-in-depth around the Heldsbach Plantation and Arndt Point, while the 20th Infantry Brigade defended around the Sattelberg Road and the Mape River, with the 22nd Infantry Battalion on their southern flank around Dreger Harbour. As troops from the 20th Infantry Brigade attempted to push towards Sattelberg, the 24th began patrol actions towards Bonga; during one  of these patrols, the Allies gained a significant intelligence boon when they discovered a Japanese briefcase containing an operational order detailing plans for a coming counterattack; in addition, the Allies intercepted several Japanese radio transmissions, and deduced their intentions based upon reports of troop and ship movements. This allowed the Australians to switch to a defensive strategy instead of continuing to push on towards Sattelberg.

The main Japanese counterattack began on 16 October, signalled by a large bonfire on Sattelberg. The attack was conceptualised as a three-pronged action, involving a diversionary attack by elements of the 79th Infantry Regiment to the north from Bonga, a company-level attack on Scarlet Beach from the sea by elements of the 79th with the Sugino Craft Raiding Unit, and a drive from Sattelberg by the remainder of the 79th and 80th Infantry Regiments orientated upon two lines of advance: one towards Scarlet Beach, conforming with the Song River, and the other striking towards Heldsbach advancing astride the Sattelberg Road. If successful, it was intended that following a regrouping, the two infantry regiments would then clear Finschhafen and Langemak Bay, but Japanese plans went awry from the beginning.

The northern diversion was easily overcome, and failed to confuse the Australians into committing their reserves, while the central drive was launched too early – in fact the day before the assault was scheduled to begin – consequently undermining Japanese attempts to achieve sufficient weight of forces to overcome the defenders. The seaborne landing also suffered a significant setback when more than half of the seven landing craft were destroyed by PT-128 and PT-194 on the night of 8/9 October while on their way to the landing beach. They subsequently suffered heavy casualties during the assault around the beach, with US and Australian troops there mounting a stubborn defence. The beach was guarded by a Bofors 40 mm gun of the 10th Light Anti-Aircraft Battery, 2-pounder anti-tank guns and machine guns of the 2/28th, and two 37 mm guns and two .50-calibre machine guns manned by the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment. One of the .50 calibre machine guns, manned by Private Nathan van Noy, assisted by Corporal Stephen Popa, engaged a group of Japanese led by a bugler and two men with flame-throwers. A Japanese hand grenade landed in their weapon pit, shattering one of van Noy's legs and wounding Popa, but they continued to fire. Another Japanese grenade silenced them. Van Noy was subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor.

The Australians managed to hold key terrain around Jivevaneng and Katika from where the Allies employed their direct and indirect fire support to inflict heavy casualties. Nevertheless, the Japanese achieved a degree of tactical success, albeit briefly. On 18 October, a party of Japanese broke through to Siki Cove, where Australian anti-aircraft gunners and artillerymen were forced to fire over ""open sights"" and fight back with small arms, after coming under fire from troops that had gotten under the guns. That night, the Japanese cut the 2/17th Infantry Battalion's supply route, establishing a road block astride the Jivevaneng–Sattelberg road, and cutting off the Australians defending Jivevaneng. The 2/17th and a number of other Australian units, such as most of the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, as well as part of the 2/28th, became isolated behind Japanese lines.  In order to keep them supplied, emergency air drops of ammunition were flown in by pilots of No. 4 Squadron RAAF. Presented with the ambiguity of the situation, the commander of the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion withdrew one of his outposts, while Brigadier Bernard Evans, commander of the 24th Infantry Brigade, also contracted his position around the beachhead, and in doing so subsequently granted the Japanese the prime position of Katika. The Australian divisional commander, Wootten, was enraged by the decision and subsequently lambasted his commander via radio. In response, the 2/13th Infantry Battalion detached two companies from rear area security and sent them north, while the 2/28th Infantry Battalion launched a counterattack against the Japanese around Katika, which – supported by artillery – successfully regained the position.

Nevertheless, largely the fighting went in favour of the Allies, and finally the Japanese assault ground to a halt. Despite forcing a contraction of the Australian forces defending the beachhead, on 21 October the Japanese withdrew from Siki Cove, although the fighting around Katika continued for four more days as the Japanese attempted to retake it. Fierce resistance from the 2/28th halted them and eventually the attack was called off on 24 October, with the Japanese having suffered heavily due to tactical deficiencies, poor co-ordination and operational security, and a lack of artillery. Meanwhile, the Allied response was hampered by poor working relationships at some of the highest levels between Australian and US commanders – particularly between I Corps commander Lieutenant General Edmund Herring and the VII Amphibious Force commander Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey – the lack of a unified command structure, over cautiousness amongst naval staff, and a poor appreciation of overall Japanese strength and intentions by the highest level of the Allied command who failed to send reinforcements until it was almost too late. Casualties during the attack amounted to at least 679 Japanese killed with another 821 estimated as wounded, while the Australians lost 49 killed and 179 wounded.

Aftermath

Following the conclusion of the fighting around Finschhafen and the defeat of the Japanese counterattack, the Allies began preparing for a concerted assault on the Japanese main defensive position around Sattelberg. In the wake of the Japanese counterattack, the members of the Australian and American staff began working more closely together and reinforcements were quickly approved in the form of the 26th Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier David Whitehead, as well as a squadron of Matilda tanks from the 1st Tank Battalion – whose presence the Australians sought to keep secret for as long as possible – which were landed at Langemak Bay. Supplies were landed by US troops from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, and then brought up and cached around Jivevaneng and Kumawa, but heavy rain hampered the Australian efforts until mid-November.

The Australians subsequently were able to reduce and then secure the Japanese strong hold around Sattelberg against determined resistance following a hard slog through dense jungle, working in concert with the Matilda tanks. Elsewhere, further actions were planned, with the 7th Division preparing to advance through the Markham and Ramu Valleys as part of the inland advance towards Shaggy Ridge and then the north coast, in order to cut off the Japanese withdrawal route from the Huon Peninsula. This drive would ultimately be unsuccessful in preventing the bulk of the Japanese forces on the Huon Peninsula from escaping. At the same time, once Sattelberg was secured, a simultaneous drive was undertaken to clear the Wareo plateau, which provided good observation towards Scarlet Beach as well as serving as a junction for Japanese lines of communication south. Once Wareo was secure, the Allies advanced along the coast towards Sio, while US forces landed at Saidor to follow up the withdrawing Japanese. Nevertheless, the US and Australian forces would come up against the same forces throughout the remainder of the war around Madang and Aitape–Wewak.

Finschhafen was subsequently developed into ""one of the largest bases in the Southwest Pacific area"" according to Garth Pratten. Throughout 1944, the base saw considerable development with the establishment of a staging camp that had a divisional capacity, a wharf, ramps for tank landing ships LSTs ramps and piers. In addition, several airfields were established capable of hosting both fighter and bomber aircraft, as well as several fuel dumps. From Finschhafen, the Allies were able to project air power towards the main Japanese base at Rabaul, and seal off the Vitiaz and Dampier Straits. In addition, the base became an important logistics hub, playing an important role in supplying the American war machine as it advanced through the Philippines in 1944–1945.

In 1961, the battle honour ""Finschhafen"" was awarded to the Australian Army units that had been involved in the capture of Finschhafen. Covering the period 22 September to 8 December 1943, it includes the capture of Scarlet Beach, the Defence of Scarlet Beach, and the fighting for Sattelberg, although separate battle honours were also awarded for these actions.

"PGP word list

The PGP Word List (""Pretty Good Privacy word list"", also called a biometric word list for reasons explained below) is a list of words for conveying data bytes in a clear unambiguous way via a voice channel. They are analogous in purpose to the NATO phonetic alphabet used by pilots, except a longer list of words is used, each word corresponding to one of the 256 unique numeric byte values.

History and structure

The PGP Word List was designed in 1995 by Patrick Juola, a computational linguist, and Philip Zimmermann, creator of PGP.  The words were carefully chosen for their phonetic distinctiveness, using genetic algorithms to select lists of words that had optimum separations in phoneme space.  The candidate word lists were randomly drawn from Grady Ward's Moby Pronunciator list as raw material for the search, successively refined by the genetic algorithms.  The automated search converged to an optimized solution in about 40 hours on a DEC Alpha, a particularly fast machine in that era.

The Zimmermann–Juola list was originally designed to be used in PGPfone, a secure VoIP application, to allow the two parties to verbally compare a short authentication string to detect a man-in-the-middle attack (MiTM).  It was called a biometric word list because the authentication depended on the two human users recognizing each other's distinct voices as they read and compared the words over the voice channel, binding the identity of the speaker with the words, which helped protect against the MiTM attack.  The list can be used in many other situations where a biometric binding of identity is not needed, so calling it a biometric word list may be imprecise.  Later, it was used in PGP to compare and verify PGP public key fingerprints over a voice channel.  This is known in PGP applications as the ""biometric"" representation.  When it was applied to PGP, the list of words was further refined, with contributions by Jon Callas. More recently, it has been used in Zfone and the ZRTP protocol, the successor to PGPfone.

The list is actually composed of two lists, each containing 256 phonetically distinct words, in which each word represents a different byte value between 0 and 255. Two lists are used because reading aloud long random sequences of human words usually risks three kinds of errors: 1) transposition of two consecutive words, 2) duplicate words, or 3) omitted words. To detect all three kinds of errors, the two lists are used alternately for the even-offset bytes and the odd-offset bytes in the byte sequence. Each byte value is actually represented by two different words, depending on whether that byte appears at an even or an odd offset from the beginning of the byte sequence. The two lists are readily distinguished by the number of syllables; the even list has words of two syllables, the odd list has three.  The two lists have a maximum word length of 9 and 11 letters, respectively.  Using a two-list scheme was suggested by Zhahai Stewart.

Examples
Each byte in a bytestring is encoded as a single word. A sequence of bytes is rendered in network byte order, from left to right. For example, the leftmost (i.e. byte 0) is considered ""even"" and is encoded using the PGP Even Word table. The next byte to the right (i.e. byte 1) is considered ""odd"" and is encoded using the PGP Odd Word table. This process repeats until all bytes are encoded. Thus, ""E582"" produces ""topmost Istanbul"", whereas ""82E5"" produces ""miser travesty"".

A PGP public key fingerprint that displayed in hexadecimal as
E582 94F2 E9A2 2748 6E8B
061B 31CC 528F D7FA 3F19
would display in PGP Words (the ""biometric"" fingerprint) as
topmost Istanbul Pluto vagabond
treadmill Pacific brackish dictator
goldfish Medusa afflict bravado
chatter revolver Dupont midsummer
stopwatch whimsical cowbell bottomless

The order of bytes in a bytestring depends on Endianness.

Other word lists for data 

There are several other word lists for conveying data in a clear unambiguous way via a voice channel:
 the NATO phonetic alphabet maps individual letters and digits to individual words
 the S/KEY system maps 64 bit numbers to 6 short words of 1 to 4 characters each from a publicly accessible 2048-word dictionary. The same dictionary is used in RFC 1760 and RFC 2289.
 the Diceware system maps five base-6 random digits (almost 13 bits of entropy) to a word from a dictionary of 7,776 unique words.
 FIPS 181: Automated Password Generator converts random numbers into somewhat pronounceable ""words"".
 mnemonic encoding converts 32 bits of data into 3 words from a vocabulary of 1626 words.
 what3words encodes geographic coordinates in 3 dictionary words.

"Schismatogobius insignus

Schismatogobius insignus is a species of goby endemic to the Philippines. It is a small fish, growing to a maximum length of only . It is found in coastal marine, brackish, and freshwater habitats.

Description
Schismatogobius insignus grows to a maximum length of . It has a laterally compressed head and a protuberant belly. The mouth is oblique and large, situated at the tip of the head with the lower and upper jaws roughly equal in size. It has three rows of slender, erect, and pointed teeth on each jaw.

The first dorsal fin is small and widely separated from the second. The second dorsal fin is roughly the same size as the anal fin. The pectoral and ventral fins are pointed and are about the same lengths.

It has a whitish body with scattered tiny brown spots. Three broad diagonal bars run from its back down to its belly. The pectoral fins have three or four transverse rows of brown spots. Just behind the pectoral fins are a series of stripes. The first dorsal fin has two black or brown longitudinal bands, while the second dorsal fin has four. The caudal fin has a white spot at its base, surrounded by dark brown bands. Two large white spots are present above and below. The rest of the caudal fin is crisscrossed by dark brown bands. The ventral and anal fins are colorless.

Taxonomy and nomenclature
Schismatogobius insignus was first described by the American ichthyologist Albert William Herre in 1927 from specimens recovered in Dumaguete and Negros Oriental, Philippines. It belongs to the genus Schismatogobius of the subfamily Gobionellinae, family Oxudercidae.

The specific name is derived from Latin insignis (""distinguished""), in reference to the handsome coloration of the fish.

Distribution and habitat
Schismatogobius insignus is endemic to the Philippines. It is a demersal fish and can be found in marine, brackish, and freshwater habitats. Its coloration makes it difficult to see in sand and gravel substrates.

Kadambini is a noted Hindi-language literary monthly magazine from Delhi-based Hindustan Times Media. Established in 1960, it is the only Hindi magazine which covers a wide range of subjects including literature, science, history, sociology, politics, films and sports.

History
Through the 1960s, under its founding editor Balkrishna Rao and later under Rajendra Awasthi, Kadambini and a few other leading publications of the time, started publishing short stories (laghu katha) by leading writers like Agyeya, Mahadevi Verma, Kunwar Narayan and Ramanada Doshi. This in time had an important impact on the growth of short story movement (Nayi Kahani) in Hindi literature. Soon, it became a prominent magazine of North India, and flourished through the 1980s, and along with magazines like Dharmyug and Sarika, allowed Hindi-language media to acquire a character of their own.

The magazine also awards, the annual ""Kadambini Prizes"", given after on-the-spot essay and short story competitions.

Nick LaRocca was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the son of poor Sicilian immigrants. His father was Girolamo LaRocca of Salaparuta, Sicily and his mother was Vita De Nina of Poggioreale, Sicily. Young Nick was attracted to the music of the brass bands in New Orleans and covertly taught himself to play cornet against the wishes of his father who hoped his son would go into a more prestigious profession. LaRocca at first worked as an electrician, playing music on the side.

From around 1910 through 1916 he was a regular member of Papa Jack Laine's bands. While not considered as one of the most virtuosic or creative of the Laine players, he was well regarded for playing a solid lead with a strong lip which allowed him to play long parades without let up or to play several gigs in a row on the same day.

In 1916 he was chosen as a last-minute replacement for Frank Christian in Johnny Stein's band to play a job up in Chicago, Illinois. This band became the famous Original Dixieland Jazz Band, making the first commercially issued jazz recordings in New York City in 1917. These recordings were hits and made the band into celebrities.

Soon other New Orleans musicians began following the O.D.J.B.'s path, arriving in New York to play jazz. LaRocca was uneasy about competition. Frank Christian recalled that LaRocca offered him $200 and a return railway ticket to go back home. After a band featuring New Orleans musicians Alcide Nunez, Tom Brown, and Ragbaby Stevens won a battle of the bands against the O.D.J.B., drummer Ragbaby found his drum heads mysteriously slashed.

The band gave LaRocca the nickname ""Joe Blade"", and published a song called ""Joe Blade, Sharp as a Tack"".

LaRocca led this band on tours of England and the United States into the early 1920s, when he suffered a nervous breakdown. He returned to New Orleans and retired from music, going into the construction and contracting business. His chair in the band was taken by Henry Levine, a teenage trumpeter devoted to traditional jazz stylings. Levine later led one of the house bands on NBC's radio series The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street.

In 1936 Nick LaRocca reunited the ODJB for a successful tour and more recordings. LaRocca proclaimed that he and his band were the inventors of the now nationally popular swing music. He and the reunited Original Dixieland Jazz Band performed ""Tiger Rag"" in The March of Time newsreel segment titled ""Birth of Swing,"" released to U.S. theaters February 19, 1937. Personality conflicts broke up the band again in 1937, and LaRocca again retired from music. He died in New Orleans in 1961.

Later life and controversy
In the 1950s, he wrote numerous vehement letters to newspapers, radio, and television shows, stating that he was the true and sole inventor of jazz music, damaging his credibility and provoking a backlash against him and his reputation and career. He made obviously exaggerated claims that he was ""The Creator of Jazz"", ""The Christopher Columbus of Music"", and ""The most lied about person in history since Jesus Christ"" .

When Tulane University established their Archive of New Orleans Jazz, now the Hogan Jazz Archive, in 1958, LaRocca donated his large collection of items related to the O.D.J.B. to Tulane, including several scrapbooks made by LaRocca.

At the same time, he worked with writer H.O. Brunn on the book The Story of the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. In the book, LaRocca claimed that he founded the Original Dixieland Jass Band in 1908. The book was dismissive of the other members of the O.D.J.B. It was perhaps kindest to clarinetist Larry Shields.

Musicologists and historians who seek to assess LaRocca's contributions to jazz are hindered by LaRocca's self-aggrandizement. A balanced assessment would have to acknowledge that Nick LaRocca was an important figure in taking jazz from a regional style to international popularity, the leader of the most influential jazz band of the period from 1917 to 1921, and a good player in a very early jazz style on records such as ""Clarinet Marmalade"". LaRocca's playing and recordings were an important early influence on such later jazz trumpeters as Red Nichols, Bix Beiderbecke and Phil Napoleon. Nick LaRocca's 1917 composition ""Tiger Rag"" was covered by Louis Armstrong in several different versions throughout his career, while Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, and The Mills Brothers also recorded important and influential cover versions of the jazz standard. Additional information about Nick LaRocca and his biographer can be found in Salvatore Mugno's Il biografo di Nick LaRocca. Come entrare nelle storie del jazz, Besa Editrice, Nardò (Lecce), Italia, 2005.

Legacy
Nick LaRocca's 1917 composition ""Tiger Rag"" is one of the most important and influential jazz standards of the twentieth century. There were 136 cover versions of LaRocca's copyrighted composition ""Tiger Rag"" by 1942 alone.

Among the artists who have recorded ""Tiger Rag"" are Louis Armstrong, Charlie Parker, Benny Goodman, Frank Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Kid Ory and his Creole Jazz Orchestra, Bix Beiderbecke, Les Paul, Art Tatum, The Mills Brothers in a No. 1 pop version, and Bob Crosby.

The Original Dixieland Jazz Band is now regarded as one of the seminal groups in the formation and development of jazz. The ODJB compositions have been covered by everyone from Louis Armstrong to Duke Ellington to Joe Jackson. The influence of the ODJB on the history and development of jazz is undeniable.

Honors

In 2006, his 1917 recording of ""Darktown Strutters' Ball"" with the Original Dixieland Jass Band was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

"Pendle witches

The trials of the Pendle witches in 1612 are among the most famous  witch trials in English history, and some of the best recorded of the 17th century. The twelve accused lived in the area surrounding Pendle Hill in Lancashire, and were charged with the murders of ten people by the use of witchcraft. All but two were tried at Lancaster Assizes on 18–19 August 1612, along with the Samlesbury witches and others, in a series of trials that have become known as the Lancashire witch trials. One was tried at York Assizes on 27 July 1612, and another died in prison. Of the eleven who went to trial – nine women and two men – ten were found guilty and executed by hanging; one was found not guilty.

The official publication of the proceedings by the clerk to the court, Thomas Potts, in his The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster, and the number of witches hanged together – nine at Lancaster and one at York – make the trials unusual for England at that time. It has been estimated that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions; this series of trials accounts for more than two per cent of that total.

Six of the Pendle witches came from one of two families, each at the time headed by a woman in her eighties: Elizabeth Southerns (a.k.a. Demdike), her daughter Elizabeth Device, and her grandchildren James and Alizon Device; Anne Whittle (a.k.a. Chattox), and her daughter Anne Redferne. The others accused were Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, Alice Grey, and Jennet Preston. The outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle may demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living by posing as witches. Many of the allegations resulted from accusations that members of the Demdike and Chattox families made against each other, perhaps because they were in competition, both trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion.

Religious and political background 

The accused witches lived in the area around Pendle Hill in Lancashire, a county which, at the end of the 16th century, was regarded by the authorities as a wild and lawless region: an area ""fabled for its theft, violence and sexual laxity, where the church was honoured without much understanding of its doctrines by the common people"". The nearby Cistercian abbey at Whalley had been dissolved by Henry VIII in 1537, a move strongly resisted by the local people, over whose lives the abbey had until then exerted a powerful influence. Despite the abbey's closure, and the execution of its abbot, the people of Pendle remained largely faithful to their Roman Catholic beliefs and were quick to revert to Catholicism on Queen Mary's accession to the throne in 1553.

When Mary's Protestant half-sister Elizabeth came to the throne in 1558 Catholic priests once again had to go into hiding, but in remote areas such as Pendle they continued to celebrate Mass in secret. In 1562, early in her reign, Elizabeth passed a law in the form of An Act Against Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts (5 Eliz. I c. 16). This demanded the death penalty, but only where harm had been caused; lesser offences were punishable by a term of imprisonment. The Act provided that anyone who should ""use, practise, or exercise any Witchcraft, Enchantment, Charm, or Sorcery, whereby any person shall happen to be killed or destroyed"", was guilty of a felony without benefit of clergy, and was to be put to death.

On Elizabeth's death in 1603 she was succeeded by James I. Strongly influenced by Scotland's separation from the Catholic Church during the Scottish Reformation, James was intensely interested in Protestant theology, focusing much of his curiosity on the theology of witchcraft. By the early 1590s he had become convinced that he was being plotted against by Scottish witches. After a visit to Denmark, he had attended the trial in 1590 of the North Berwick witches, who were convicted of using witchcraft to send a storm against the ship that carried James and his wife Anne back to Scotland. In 1597 he wrote a book, Daemonologie, instructing his followers that they must denounce and prosecute any supporters or practitioners of witchcraft. One year after James acceded to the English throne, a law was enacted imposing the death penalty in cases where it was proven that harm had been caused through the use of magic, or corpses had been exhumed for magical purposes. James was, however, sceptical of the evidence presented in witch trials, even to the extent of personally exposing discrepancies in the testimonies presented against some accused witches.

In early 1612, the year of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a criminal offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.

It was perhaps difficult for the judges charged with hearing the trials – Sir James Altham and Sir Edward Bromley – to understand King James's attitude towards witchcraft. The king was head of the judiciary, and Bromley was hoping for promotion to a circuit nearer London. Altham was nearing the end of his judicial career, but he had recently been accused of a miscarriage of justice at the York Assizes, which had resulted in a woman being sentenced to death by hanging for witchcraft. The judges may have been uncertain whether the best way to gain the King's favour was by encouraging convictions, or by ""sceptically testing the witnesses to destruction"".

Events leading up to the trials 

One of the accused, Demdike, had been regarded in the area as a witch for fifty years, and some of the deaths the witches were accused of had happened many years before Roger Nowell started to take an interest in 1612. The event that seems to have triggered Nowell's investigation, culminating in the Pendle witch trials, occurred on 21 March 1612.

On her way to Trawden Forest, Demdike's granddaughter, Alizon Device, encountered John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, and asked him for some pins. Seventeenth-century metal pins were handmade and relatively expensive, but they were frequently needed for magical purposes, such as in healing – particularly for treating warts – divination, and for love magic, which may have been why Alizon was so keen to get hold of them and why Law was so reluctant to sell them to her. Whether she meant to buy them, as she claimed, and Law refused to undo his pack for such a small transaction, or whether she had no money and was begging for them, as Law's son Abraham claimed, is unclear. A few minutes after their encounter Alizon saw Law stumble and fall, perhaps because he suffered a stroke; he managed to regain his feet and reach a nearby inn. Initially Law made no accusations against Alizon, but she appears to have been convinced of her own powers; when Abraham Law took her to visit his father a few days after the incident, she reportedly confessed and asked for his forgiveness.

Alizon Device, her mother Elizabeth, and her brother James were summoned to appear before Nowell on 30 March 1612. Alizon confessed that she had sold her soul to the Devil, and that she had told him to lame John Law after he had called her a thief. Her brother, James, stated that his sister had also confessed to bewitching a local child. Elizabeth was more reticent, admitting only that her mother, Demdike, had a mark on her body, something that many, including Nowell, would have regarded as having been left by the Devil after he had sucked her blood. When questioned about Anne Whittle (Chattox), the matriarch of the other family reputedly involved in witchcraft in and around Pendle, Alizon perhaps saw an opportunity for revenge. There may have been bad blood between the two families, possibly dating from 1601, when a member of Chattox's family broke into Malkin Tower, the home of the Devices, and stole goods worth about £1, equivalent to about £117 as of 2018. Alizon accused Chattox of murdering four men by witchcraft, and of killing her father, John Device, who had died in 1601. She claimed that her father had been so frightened of Old Chattox that he had agreed to give her  of oatmeal each year in return for her promise not to hurt his family. The meal was handed over annually until the year before John's death; on his deathbed John claimed that his sickness had been caused by Chattox because they had not paid for protection.

On 2 April 1612, Demdike, Chattox, and Chattox's daughter Anne Redferne, were summoned to appear before Nowell. Both Demdike and Chattox were by then blind and in their eighties, and both provided Nowell with damaging confessions. Demdike claimed that she had given her soul to the Devil 20 years previously, and Chattox that she had given her soul to ""a Thing like a Christian man"", on his promise that ""she would not lack anything and would get any revenge she desired"". Although Anne Redferne made no confession, Demdike said that she had seen her making clay figures. Margaret Crooke, another witness seen by Nowell that day, claimed that her brother had fallen sick and died after having had a disagreement with Redferne, and that he had frequently blamed her for his illness Based on the evidence and confessions he had obtained, Nowell committed Demdike, Chattox, Anne Redferne and Alizon Device to Lancaster Gaol, to be tried for maleficium – causing harm by witchcraft – at the next assizes.

Meeting at Malkin Tower 
The committal and subsequent trial of the four women might have been the end of the matter, had it not been for a meeting organised by Elizabeth Device at Malkin Tower, the home of the Demdikes, held on Good Friday 10 April 1612. To feed the party, James Device stole a neighbour's sheep.

Friends and others sympathetic to the family attended, and when word of it reached Roger Nowell, he decided to investigate. On 27 April 1612, an inquiry was held before Nowell and another magistrate, Nicholas Bannister, to determine the purpose of the meeting at Malkin Tower, who had attended, and what had happened there. As a result of the inquiry, eight more people were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial: Elizabeth Device, James Device, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, Alice Grey and Jennet Preston. Preston lived across the border in Yorkshire, so she was sent for trial at York Assizes; the others were sent to Lancaster Gaol, to join the four already imprisoned there.

Malkin Tower is believed to have been near the village of Newchurch in Pendle, or possibly in Blacko on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm, and to have been demolished soon after the trials.

Trials 
The Pendle witches were tried in a group that also included the Samlesbury witches, Jane Southworth, Jennet Brierley, and Ellen Brierley, the charges against whom included child murder, cannibalism; Margaret Pearson, the so-called Padiham witch, who was facing her third trial for witchcraft, this time for killing a horse; and Isobel Robey from Windle, accused of using witchcraft to cause sickness.

Some of the accused Pendle witches, such as Alizon Device, seem to have genuinely believed in their guilt, but others protested their innocence to the end. Jennet Preston was the first to be tried, at York Assizes.

York Assizes, 27 July 1612 
Jennet Preston lived in Gisburn, which was then in Yorkshire, so she was sent to York Assizes for trial. Her judges were Sir James Altham and Sir Edward Bromley. Jennet was charged with the murder by witchcraft of a local landowner, Thomas Lister of Westby Hall, to which she pleaded not guilty. She had already appeared before Bromley in 1611, accused of murdering a child by witchcraft, but had been found not guilty. The most damning evidence given against her was that when she had been taken to see Lister's body, the corpse ""bled fresh bloud presently, in the presence of all that were there present"" after she touched it. According to a statement made to Nowell by James Device on 27 April, Jennet had attended the Malkin Tower meeting to seek help with Lister's murder. She was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging; her execution took place on 29 July on the Knavesmire, the present site of York Racecourse.

Lancaster Assizes, 18–19 August 1612 

All the other accused lived in Lancashire, so they were sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the judges were once again Altham and Bromley. The prosecutor was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something that would not have been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.

Nine of the accused – Alizon Device, Elizabeth Device, James Device, Anne Whittle, Anne Redferne, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock and Jane Bulcock – were found guilty during the two-day trial and hanged at Gallows Hill in Lancaster on 20 August 1612; Elizabeth Southerns died while awaiting trial. Only one of the accused, Alice Grey, was found not guilty.

18 August

Anne Whittle (Chattox) was accused of the murder of Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the confession she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.

Elizabeth Device was charged with the murders of James Robinson, John Robinson and, together with Alice Nutter and Demdike, the murder of Henry Mitton. Elizabeth Device vehemently maintained her innocence. Potts records that ""this odious witch"" suffered from a facial deformity resulting in her left eye being set lower than her right. The main witness against Device was her daughter, Jennet, who was about nine years old. When Jennet was brought into the courtroom and asked to stand up and give evidence against her mother, Elizabeth, confronted with her own child making accusations that would lead to her execution, began to curse and scream at her daughter, forcing the judges to have her removed from the courtroom before the evidence could be heard. Jennet was placed on a table and stated that she believed her mother had been a witch for three or four years. She also said her mother had a familiar called Ball, who appeared in the shape of a brown dog. Jennet claimed to have witnessed conversations between Ball and her mother, in which Ball had been asked to help with various murders. James Device also gave evidence against his mother, saying he had seen her making a clay figure of one of her victims, John Robinson. Elizabeth Device was found guilty.

James Device pleaded not guilty to the murders by witchcraft of Anne Townley and John Duckworth. However he, like Chattox, had earlier made a confession to Nowell, which was read out in court. That, and the evidence presented against him by his sister Jennet, who said that she had seen her brother asking a black dog he had conjured up to help him kill Townley, was sufficient to persuade the jury to find him guilty.

19 August

The trials of the three Samlesbury witches were heard before Anne Redferne's first appearance in court, late in the afternoon, charged with the murder of Robert Nutter. The evidence against her was considered unsatisfactory, and she was acquitted.

Anne Redferne was not so fortunate the following day, when she faced her second trial, for the murder of Robert Nutter's father, Christopher, to which she pleaded not guilty. Demdike's statement to Nowell, which accused Anne of having made clay figures of the Nutter family, was read out in court. Witnesses were called to testify that Anne was a witch ""more dangerous than her Mother"". But she refused to admit her guilt to the end, and had given no evidence against any others of the accused. Anne Redferne was found guilty.

Jane Bulcock and her son John Bulcock, both from Newchurch in Pendle, were accused and found guilty of the murder by witchcraft of Jennet Deane. Both denied that they had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower, but Jennet Device identified Jane as having been one of those present, and John as having turned the spit to roast the stolen sheep, the centrepiece of the Good Friday meeting at the Demdike's home.

Alice Nutter was unusual among the accused in being comparatively wealthy, the widow of a tenant yeoman farmer. She made no statement either before or during her trial, except to enter her plea of not guilty to the charge of murdering Henry Mitton by witchcraft. The prosecution alleged that she, together with Demdike and Elizabeth Device, had caused Mitton's death after he had refused to give Demdike a penny she had begged from him. The only evidence against Alice seems to have been that James Device claimed Demdike had told him of the murder, and Jennet Device in her statement said that Alice had been present at the Malkin Tower meeting. Alice may have called in on the meeting at Malkin Tower on her way to a secret (and illegal) Good Friday Catholic service, and refused to speak for fear of incriminating her fellow Catholics. Many of the Nutter family were Catholics, and two had been executed as Jesuit priests, John Nutter in 1584 and his brother Robert in 1600. Alice Nutter was found guilty.

Katherine Hewitt (a.k.a. Mould-Heeles) was charged and found guilty of the murder of Anne Foulds. She was the wife of a clothier from Colne, and had attended the meeting at Malkin Tower with Alice Grey. According to the evidence given by James Device, both Hewitt and Grey told the others at that meeting that they had killed a child from Colne, Anne Foulds. Jennet Device also picked Katherine out of a line-up, and confirmed her attendance at the Malkin Tower meeting.

Alice Grey was accused with Katherine Hewitt of the murder of Anne Foulds. Potts does not provide an account of Alice Grey's trial, simply recording her as one of the Samlesbury witches – which she was not, as she was one of those identified as having been at the Malkin Tower meeting – and naming her in the list of those found not guilty.

Alizon Device, whose encounter with John Law had triggered the events leading up to the trials, was charged with causing harm by witchcraft. Uniquely among the accused, Alizon was confronted in court by her alleged victim, John Law. She seems to have genuinely believed in her own guilt; when Law was brought into court Alizon fell to her knees in tears and confessed. She was found guilty.

The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster 

Almost everything that is known about the trials comes from a report of the proceedings written by Thomas Potts, the clerk to the Lancaster Assizes. Potts was instructed to write his account by the trial judges, and had completed the work by 16 November 1612, when he submitted it for review. Bromley revised and corrected the manuscript before its publication in 1613, declaring it to be ""truly reported"" and ""fit and worthie to be published"".

Although written as an apparently verbatim account, The Wonderfull Discoverie is not a report of what was actually said at the trial but is instead reflecting what happened. Nevertheless, Potts ""seems to give a generally trustworthy, although not comprehensive, account of an Assize witchcraft trial, provided that the reader is constantly aware of his use of written material instead of verbatim reports"".

The trials took place not quite seven years after the Gunpowder Plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament in an attempt to kill King James and the Protestant aristocracy had been foiled. It was alleged that the Pendle witches had hatched their own gunpowder plot to blow up Lancaster Castle, although historian Stephen Pumfrey has suggested that the ""preposterous scheme"" was invented by the examining magistrates and simply agreed to by James Device in his witness statement. It may therefore be significant that Potts dedicated The Wonderfull Discoverie to Thomas Knyvet and his wife Elizabeth; Knyvet was the man credited with apprehending Guy Fawkes and thus saving the King.

Modern interpretation 
It has been estimated that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people were indicted for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.

Pendle was part of the parish of Whalley, an area covering , too large to be effective in preaching and teaching the doctrines of the Church of England: both the survival of Catholicism and the upsurge of witchcraft in Lancashire have been attributed to its over-stretched parochial structure. Until its dissolution, the spiritual needs of the people of Pendle and surrounding districts had been served by nearby Whalley Abbey, but its closure in 1537 left a moral vacuum.

Many of the allegations made in the Pendle witch trials resulted from members of the Demdike and Chattox families making accusations against each other. Historian John Swain has said that the outbreaks of witchcraft in and around Pendle demonstrate the extent to which people could make a living either by posing as a witch, or by accusing or threatening to accuse others of being a witch. Although it is implicit in much of the literature on witchcraft that the accused were victims, often mentally or physically abnormal, for some at least, it may have been a trade like any other, albeit one with significant risks. There may have been bad blood between the Demdike and Chattox families because they were in competition with each other, trying to make a living from healing, begging, and extortion. The Demdikes are believed to have lived close to Newchurch in Pendle, and the Chattox family about  away, near the village of Fence.

Aftermath and legacy 

Altham continued with his judicial career until his death in 1617, and Bromley achieved his desired promotion to the Midlands Circuit in 1616. Potts was given the keepership of Skalme Park by James in 1615, to breed and train the king's hounds. In 1618, he was given responsibility for ""collecting the forfeitures on the laws concerning sewers, for twenty-one years"". Having played her part in the deaths of her mother, brother, and sister, Jennet Device may eventually have found herself accused of witchcraft. A woman with that name was listed in a group of 20 tried at Lancaster Assizes on 24 March 1634, although it cannot be certain that it was the same Jennet Device. The charge against her was the murder of Isabel Nutter, William Nutter's wife. In that series of trials the chief prosecution witness was a ten-year-old boy, Edmund Robinson. All but one of the accused were found guilty, but the judges refused to pass death sentences, deciding instead to refer the case to the king, Charles I. Under cross-examination in London, Robinson admitted that he had fabricated his evidence, but even though four of the accused were eventually pardoned, they all remained incarcerated in Lancaster Gaol, where it is likely that they died. An official record dated 22 August 1636 lists Jennet Device as one of those still held in the prison. These later Lancashire witchcraft trials were the subject of a contemporary play written by Thomas Heywood and Richard Brome, The Late Lancashire Witches.

In modern times the witches have become the inspiration for Pendle's tourism and heritage industries, with local shops selling a variety of witch-motif gifts. Burnley's Moorhouse's produces a beer called Pendle Witches Brew, and there is a Pendle Witch Trail running from Pendle Heritage Centre to Lancaster Castle, where the accused witches were held before their trial. The X43 bus route run by Burnley Bus Company has been branded The Witch Way, with some of the vehicles operating on it named after the witches in the trial. Pendle Hill, which dominates the landscape of the area, continues to be associated with witchcraft, and hosts a hilltop gathering every Halloween.

A petition was presented to UK Home Secretary Jack Straw in 1998 asking for the witches to be pardoned, but it was decided that their convictions should stand. Ten years later another petition was organised in an attempt to obtain pardons for Chattox and Demdike. It followed the Swiss government's pardon earlier that year of Anna Göldi, beheaded in 1782, thought to be the last person in Europe to be executed as a witch.

Literary adaptations and other media 
William Harrison Ainsworth, a Victorian novelist considered in his day the equal of Dickens, wrote a romanticised account of the Pendle witches published in 1849. The Lancashire Witches is the only one of his 40 novels never to have been out of print. The British writer Robert Neill dramatised the events of 1612 in his novel Mist over Pendle, first published in 1951. The writer and poet Blake Morrison treated the subject in his suite of poems Pendle Witches, published in 1996, and in 2011 poet Simon Armitage narrated a documentary on BBC Four, The Pendle Witch Child.

2012 anniversary 

Events to mark the 400th anniversary of the trials in 2012 included an exhibition, ""A Wonderful Discoverie: Lancashire Witches 1612–2012"", at Gawthorpe Hall staged by Lancashire County Council. The Fate of Chattox, a piece by David Lloyd-Mostyn for clarinet and piano, taking its theme from the events leading to Chattox's demise, was performed by Aquilon at the Chorlton Arts Festival.

A life-size statue of Alice Nutter, by sculptor David Palmer, was unveiled in her home village, Roughlee. In August, a world record for the largest group dressed as witches was set by 482 people who walked up Pendle Hill, on which the date ""1612"" had been installed in 400-foot-tall numbers by artist Philippe Handford using horticultural fleece. The Bishop of Burnley, the Rt Rev John Goddard, expressed concern about marking the anniversary on the side of the hill.

Publications in 2012 inspired by the trials include two novellas, The Daylight Gate by Jeanette Winterson and Malkin Child by Livi Michael. Blake Morrison published a volume of poetry, A Discoverie of Witches.

"Christ Church Detroit

Christ Church Detroit is an Episcopal church located at 960 East Jefferson Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. It is also known as  Old Christ Church, Detroit. It is the oldest Protestant church in Michigan still located on its original site. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1970 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

History 
Brothers Robert (Jr.) and William Stead ran a wholesale grocery business at the present site of Christ Church until the year 1844. Christ Church Detroit was founded by a group of Episcopalians in 1845, who decided that St. Paul's Church (now St. Paul's Cathedral) was too crowded. The founders built a small wooden church, designed by Lieutenant Montgomery C. Meigs, as its first place of worship. Fifteen years later, plans were laid for a new building on the same site. In 1861, a chapel was constructed near the original structure for use while a larger church was constructed. The present church, designed by Gordon W. Lloyd, was completed in 1864.

Construction 
The church is built in an American Gothic style, using limestone and sandstone; a massive belfry with a squared-off Germanic roof dominates the front facade. The interior boasts transepts with galleries and hammerbeam trusses supporting the roof. All interior woodwork, save the roof, is made from local butternut. There are two Tiffany windows in the church, with more windows designed by other famous glass companies such as Franz Meyer and Company and J. Wippell and Co..

Current use 
The Christ Church building has been continuously by an Episcopalian congregation since its construction. The current Rector is the Rev. Emily Williams Guffey. The congregation describes themselves as ""a contemporary, well-educated, multi-racial, multi-ethnic congregation carrying out Christ's mission in the world around us, strengthened, nurtured, and guided by the presence of the Holy Spirit."" The next-door Sibley House serves as offices.

"List of the oldest mosques

The designation of the oldest mosques in the world requires careful use of definitions, and must be divided into two parts, the oldest in the sense of oldest surviving building, and the oldest in the sense of oldest mosque congregation. Even here, there is the distinction between old mosque buildings that have been in continuous use as mosques, and those that have been converted to other purposes; and between buildings that have been in continuous use as mosques and those that were shuttered for many decades. In terms of congregations, they are distinguished between early established congregations that have been in continuous existence, and early congregations that ceased to exist. Note that the major regions, such as Africa and Eurasia, are sorted alphabetically, whereas the minor regions, such as Northeast and Northwest Africa in Africa, and Arabia and South Asia in Eurasia, are sorted by the dates in which their first mosques were reportedly established, more or less, barring those that are mentioned by name in the Quran.

To be listed here a site must:
be the oldest mosque in a country, large city (top 50), or oldest of its type (denomination, architectural, etc.);
be the oldest congregation of its type (denomination).

Mentioned in the Quran 
The following are treated as the oldest mosques or sanctuaries mentioned in the Quran:

Africa

Americas

Eurasia 

'Eurasia' is treated here not as a continental landmass, but a combination of European and Asian countries, including island-states such as Japan and the United Kingdom.

"Sangoma (Abdullah Ibrahim album)

Sangoma is a solo piano album by Abdullah Ibrahim. It was recorded in 1973 and released by Sackville Records. Parts of the original release were later issued on compilation albums.

Recording and music
The album was recorded in Toronto on 18 February 1973. Material from the recording session was released on this album and on African Portraits.

""The Aloe and the Wild Rose"" and ""Ancient Africa"" each contain three parts. The other track, ""Fats, Duke and the Monk"", is a six-song suite.

Releases and reception

Sangoma was released by Sackville Records. The AllMusic reviewer concluded that, ""Ibrahim's distinctive percussive style with its emphasis on folk melodies was very much in evidence at this relatively early stage."" The Penguin Guide to Jazz observed that the recording was ""in dramatic close-up"".

Material from Sangoma and African Portraits was later compiled in the album Ancient Africa, which was released by Sackville in 1994. A 2017 CD reissue of this compilation added a previously unreleased track featuring Ibrahim on flute as well as reciting words. It was issued by Delmark Records, which had earlier acquired the Sackville catalogue.

"Chester Gladiators

Chester Gladiators Rugby League Football Club is a rugby league club in Chester, England. They play in the North West Division of the Rugby League Conference, North West Counties and the North West Merit League.

History

Previous clubs in Chester

Although Chester is less than 45 minutes drive from rugby league strongholds such as Warrington, Widnes, Wigan and St Helens but rugby league has traditionally failed to capture the imagination of locals and the sport struggled to maintain a place in the city's sporting calendar.

The most notable attempt at developing the game in Chester was when Chester Wolves entered the Rugby League Conference in 1998. They were crowned champions the following season, after a Grand Final victory over Crawley Jets. Unfortunately, the club were unable to build on this early success.

In 2005, the Chester Wolves name returned to the Conference after Widnes based club West Bank Bears played under this name. However, this venture failed to capture local interest and the club left the Rugby League Conference for a second time at the end of the 2006 season.

Chester Gladiators

A new side, Chester Gladiators Rugby League Football Club, was formed in April 2008 by a group of enthusiasts who shared a belief that the sport could prosper in the area.

The club operated an open age side in the RL Merit League and received significant praise for their efforts both on and off the field; playing a total of seven matches and securing two victories, a 36-28 at North Derbyshire Chargers and a 66-14 hammering of Wolverhampton Warlords. At the end of the debut season they were named RL Merit League Club of the Year and our Chairman Jim Green received the RL Merit League Pioneer of the Year award whilst two players were named in the RL Merit League Dream Team.

The 2009 season saw the launch of a new junior section and a second open age team as the club continued to develop. They won the first Cheshire Challenge Cup final beating Crewe & Nantwich Steamers. Our first team enjoyed a successful season in the RL Merit League, winning ten of their twelve matches and securing a play-off berth for the first time. The newly formed A team also took part in two matches, ensuring that the club was able to provide all of its members with the chance to experience rugby league. The senior sections efforts were rewarded when Alec Read was named as the Kukri RL Merit League Young Player of the Year while the club received an award for their work with the media. At junior level a number of taster days were staged and an under-12s team played five matches, securing two victories.

Chester Gladiators set up a winter side Chester ARLFC to compete in the North West Counties league for 2010-11.

"Mortuary Affairs

Mortuary Affairs is a service within the United States Army Quartermaster Corps tasked with the retrieval, identification, transportation, and burial of deceased American and American-allied military personnel.

The Air Force has a similar facility at Dover AFB in Delaware.

Until 1991, the army's mortuary affairs was known as the Graves Registration Service (GRS or GRREG). The Graves Registration Service was created several months after the United States entered World War I.

The current Army Military Occupational Specialty for the career field is 92A (a general code for officers across the Quartermaster Corps) and 92M for enlisted personnel.

Responsibilities
Mortuary Affairs is responsible for retrieval, identification, transportation, and burial of American soldiers. Retrieval can be further subdivided into:
 Combat Recovery – Recovery while combat is still ongoing.
 Post-Combat Recovery – Recovery of the dead immediately after combat has ceased. Danger from mines and enemy snipers is still quite high. Until the 20th century, it was commonplace for combatants to call battlefield truces, in which combatants would temporarily cease fire to allow for the collection of their dead. This practice has ceased in modern warfare.
 Area/Theater Recovery
 Historical Recovery

The role of the Mortuary Affairs service is legally defined in 10 USC, subtitle A, Chapter 75, Subchapter I, section 1471.

Mortuary Affairs has historically been tied with investigation of war crimes. Following World War II, Graves Registration Personnel were instructed to forward all pathological evidence indicating war crimes to the War Crimes Commission.

The Mortuary Affairs Creed is 'Dignity, Reverence, Respect.'

History

Pre-World War I
In the Seminole Wars and Mexican–American War, American soldiers were buried near where they fell, with no effort made to return and little effort made to identify the dead. The American Civil War marked the first time the United States made a concerted effort to identify fallen soldiers. General Order No. 33 specified that field commanders were responsible for identification and burial efforts. However, these efforts were not well organized or executed, and were often given low priority. (Commanders were more concerned with winning battles than with the disposition of fallen soldiers). After the war, remains of Union soldiers were disinterred and reburied in National Cemeteries.

During the Spanish–American War, the United States initiated a policy of returning soldiers killed on foreign soil back to next-of-kin in the United States, the first country in the world to do so. ""Quartermaster General Marshall I. Ludington spoke words that became a harbinger of U.S. retrieval efforts in major world conflicts only a few years later. He said the efforts of the Quartermaster Corps in the Spanish–American War were most likely the first attempt of a nation to ""disinter the remains of all its soldiers who, in defense of their country, had given up their lives on a foreign shore, and bring them... to their native land for return to their relatives and friends or their reinternment in the beautiful cemeteries which have been provided by our Government for its defenders.""

During the Philippine–American War, the Burial Corps and United States Army Morgue and Office of Identification had overlapping responsibilities for care of the dead.

World War I

The Graves registration service was created by General Order #104, issued on August 7, 1917, several months after the United States entered World War I. It consolidated the existing departments into the Graves Registration Service. At its inception, the Graves registration service consisted of the 301st, 302nd, 303rd, and 304th Grave Registration Units. They were deployed to Europe during the war. Many of the men that served in these units had been incapacitated for field service.

World War II
The Graves Registration Service ceased to exist during Interwar period. This led to difficulties reactivating the service at the beginning of World War II. Despite these initial difficulties, by the end of the war, the Graves Registration service consisted of more than 30 active companies and 11 separately numbered platoons.

At the end of World War II, the Graves Registration service was again effectively disbanded.

Korean War

The sudden onset of the Korean War caused many problems for the Graves Registration Service. Only one platoon was available in the entire theater. ""As the conflict grew in intensity, and deaths of United Nations personnel increased, it became necessary for each combat division to establish and operate its own cemetery, pending the arrival of graves registration companies from the zone of interior to assume this responsibility."" The rugged terrain and difficult lines of communication further hampered Graves Registration Service activities. Shifts in the momentum of the war meant that it was not uncommon for whole cemeteries to be disinterred and moved elsewhere.

Starting on Christmas Day in 1950, the United States made a sweeping change in its policies regarding the handling of soldiers who had been killed in action. Rather than burying them in temporary cemeteries for return at a future date after the conclusion of the war, soldiers killed in action were immediately returned to the United States. This policy, known as concurrent return, remains in effect to this day.

Vietnam War
Better transportation, communication, and laboratory techniques allowed a higher rate of body identification in the Vietnam War than in previous conflicts. 96% of Americans killed in action were recovered, compared to 78% for both World War II and Korea. By the end of the war, only 28 bodies remained unidentified. All but one of them were identified by 1984, when the last one was interred in the Tomb of the Unknowns. (Using mitochondrial DNA, in 1998 the last unknown was identified as Michael Blassie.)

Iraq War and War in Afghanistan

The 54th Quartermaster Company and 111th Quartermaster Company are the Army's only standing, permanent mortuary affairs units. Mortuary affairs training takes place at Fort Lee, Virginia, and lasts about seven weeks. These soldiers search areas for hasty or unmarked graves, unburied dead, personal effects, and identification media. They also assist in preparation, preservation, and shipment of remains.

The Charles C. Carson Center for Mortuary Affairs at Dover Air Force Base is where remains of those killed in action are processed and returned home.  There are currently two U.S. Army Mortuaries located in Germany and Korea.  These locations have U.S. licensed funeral directors and embalmers along with 92M staffing to provide services to all Department of Defense components that are located within their respective areas.

Some of those who have volunteered to work with the dead will serve at collection points in Iraq and Afghanistan; others will work in the port mortuary at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Another small group will work with the 246th or 311th Quartermaster Company from Puerto Rico, a Reserve Mortuary Affairs unit, in Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, at the Joint Personal Effects Depot (JPED). Here, soldiers will receive, inventory, process, clean, filter, and ship all items belonging to deceased or injured soldiers.

The 92Ms have cared for the majority of the more than 4,500 military casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. They operate under a code of conduct that's part scientific and part symbolic. Using the language of a medical examiner, they fill out forms describing and annotating every wound and marking on the remains they receive. They also ""render honors"" to each soldier in their care.

In 2008, the Department of Defense lifted its ban on media coverage (especially photographs) of the return of the remains of fallen service members.  Currently, news media may be present if the survivors of the dead give their consent.  The ban had been in effect for 18 years, having been instituted in 1991, at the time of the Persian Gulf War.  However, the ban was waived on a large number of occasions, to the point that its existence only became widely known in 2004.  When the ban was enforced at that time, it was widely criticized as politically motivated.

Health issues
Studies have shown that mortuary affairs personnel have some of the highest rates of post traumatic stress disorder. ""Analysis has revealed three psychological components of handling remains: ""the gruesomeness,"" ""an emotional link between the viewer and the remains,"" and ""personal threats to the remains handler.""
Anecdotal evidence also suggests that those involved with the removal and disposal of war-dead often have to deal with a great amount of psychological pressure later on in their lives, as well as at the time of their duties.

"1998 Pennsylvania gubernatorial election

The Pennsylvania Gubernatorial election of 1998 was held on November 3, 1998. It was between incumbent Republican Tom Ridge, Democrat Ivan Itkin, Constitutionalist Peg Luksik and Libertarian Ken Krawchuk. Ridge, a popular moderate, won with 57% of the votes cast.

Primary Elections 
Incumbent Governor Ridge ran unopposed for the Republican nomination. State Representative Ivan Itkin from Pittsburgh bested former Auditor General and US Representative Don Bailey from Greensburg and private detective and anti-corruption activist Bill Keisling from York. Itkin, although well not well known in the state, was a powerful figure in the legislature and had the backing of the party establishment, while the conservative Bailey drew strong union support.

Major party candidates

Democratic
Ivan Itkin, State Representative
Running mate: Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, former US Congresswoman

Republican 
Tom Ridge, incumbent Governor
Running mate: Mark Schweiker, incumbent Lieutenant Governor

Minor party candidates

Constitution 
Peg Luksik, director of a pro-life organization
Running mate: Jim Clymer, attorney

Libertarian 
Ken Krawchuk, technology consultant
Running mate: Henry Haller, attorney

Campaign
During this election cycle, Democrats struggled with fundraising issues and had difficulty recruiting a top tier candidate. Itkin, who had little name recognition statewide, was considered to be a sacrificial lamb. Peg Luksik, who was well known as an outspoken opponent of abortion, ran as a strong third party contender for the second consecutive election cycle; she emphasized the pro-choice stances of both candidates and drew votes in the state's rural, conservative center. However, Ridge's victory was never in doubt, as he ran on a generally positive record from his prior term and a combination of traditional Republican strategies (such as his ""tough on crime"" image) combined with his ability to somewhat undercut Democratic support (such as through his labor ties).

After a career-ending injury, he transferred to the University of Georgia, from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in 1952. While a student, he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.  He served in the United States Army during the Korean War. In 1953, Rousakis married Irene Fotopoulos (1933-1985), and they later had four children. Prior to entering politics, he was an insurance agent.

Electoral history

Rousakis was elected to the Chatham County Commission in 1965 and eventually became Vice-Chairperson of that institution.

He ran for Mayor of Savannah in 1970.  He won the Democratic nomination and defeated one-term incumbent and Republican nominee Julius Curtis Lewis, Jr. with 55% of the vote.

He won re-election in 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986.

His fifth term was extended by a year by the Georgia General Assembly, but Rousakis was defeated by Republican contestant Susan Weiner in 1991 with 46% of the vote.

He attempted a political comeback in 1995, but finished third with only 23% of the vote.

Achievements

Under Rousakis' mayorship, River Street was revitalized, the police department and public work activities were modernized and the unpolluting of the Savannah River was undertaken.  However, the situation of public housing worsened and the local crime and murder rates increased.

In 1976, he played the role of a hotel clerk in a scene in the movie ""Gator.""

Later life and death
After his wife's death in 1985, Rousakis married Elizabeth Lattimore Sparks (b. 1948). Rousakis died on December 10, 2000.

"Looking Glass Rock

Looking Glass Rock is a pluton monolith in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, United States.

Description

The mountain is located within Pisgah National Forest about  northwest of Brevard and   southwest of Asheville. Named for the way its granite face reflects the sunshine, it rises from the valley floor to an elevation of almost .

Trails from Forest Service Road 475 and 475B lead to the top of the mountain. It is a moderate/strenuous trail climbing 1700 ft over 3.1 miles to its peak where panoramic views can be seen. There is a flat slab on the top, that can be used as a helipad.

Looking Glass Rock is a popular rock climbing destination. Whether it is free climbing, multi-pitch or aid climbing, dozens of routes traverse the South Face, North Face, Nose Area, Sun Wall, Invisible Wall and Hidden Wall to the top of the mountain.

From the top of Looking Glass Rock, panoramic views can be seen of the Blue Ridge Parkway and surrounding mountains of Transylvania County.

"Mercy Medical Center (Baltimore, Maryland)

Mercy Medical Center is a hospital located in Baltimore, Maryland. Mercy has been recognized as the #2 hospital in the State of Maryland for 2014-15 by U.S. News & World Report.

Current Facility
The landmark McCauley Tower building of the hospital along St. Paul Place to the west of North Calvert Street, opened in 1963 and is located at 301 St. Paul Place. Its form was quite unusual in that the upper two-thirds of the building of tan/light brown bricks spread out fifty yards out above the lower five stories.  Additionally the later Mary Bunting Tower skyscraper buildings and annexes further north along the east side of St. Paul Place and North Calvert Street to East Pleasant Street, and to the next block at the elevated Orleans Street Viaduct (over Bath Street) were built in the mid-2010s with additional parking garages attached to the east along Guilford Avenue.

History

Founding
Historically, Mercy was founded as ""Baltimore City Hospital"" by six Sisters of Mercy, a Roman Catholic order of nuns, on November 11, 1874, which was a merger of the Washington University School of Medicine [not the same institution with a similar name now located in St. Louis, Missouri]; (also known as a later re-incarnation of the Washington Medical College of Baltimore and the College of Physicians and Surgeons,  earlier institutions from 1870, that the Sisters had been invited to assist with by local doctors.  Their buildings were located at the northwest corner of North Calvert and East Saratoga Streets, among which was a former schoolhouse and consisted of a medical dispensary under the later name of ""Baltimore City Hospital"" ((not to be confused with an earlier Baltimore Town and later municipal ""Almshouse"" (founded 1773), which relocated to the eastern city limits and became known as the ""Bay View Asylum"", and later known by the 1930s as ""The Baltimore City Hospitals"" off Eastern Avenue beyond the outer city neighborhoods of Highlandtown, Canton and Greektown. It was west of the large suburban areas in Baltimore County of Essex, Middle River, and northwest of Dundalk and Sparrows Point. It was acquired from the City in  1984 by Johns Hopkins Hospital and Johns Hopkins University at the beginning of their joint expanded statewide medical system, and renamed ""Francis Scott Key Medical Center"", then later Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center)). A collection of Baltimore City Hospitals' papers can be found at the National Library of Medicine.

Expansion
Initially, the Mercy Hospital expanded to the north with buildings along Calvert Street towards East Pleasant Street. By the mid-1950s, the Hospital acquired the structures to the west along St. Paul Street/former Courtland Street, north of East Saratoga and south of East Pleasant Streets, which formerly housed the offices of the Baltimore City Department of Public Welfare (later known as Social Services).  These buildings had served the poor and destitute of Baltimore for several decades and a newer renovated structure was now being created on Greenmount Avenue near East Oliver Streets by the Green Mount Cemetery in the early 1950s. So the old Public Welfare structures were available for Mercy to expand into temporarily and later to replace with a new landmark symbol and tower.

Eventually the Mercy medical hospital and nursing school expanded to the west along East Saratoga Street to the neighboring Saint Paul Place

"Isomeric shift

The isomeric shift (also called isomer shift) is the shift on atomic spectral lines and gamma spectral lines, which occurs as a consequence of replacement of one nuclear isomer by another. It is usually called isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines and Mössbauer isomeric shift respectively. If the spectra also have hyperfine structure the shift refers to the center of gravity of the spectra. The isomeric shift provides important information about the nuclear structure and the physical, chemical or biological environment of atoms. More recently the effect has also been proposed as a tool in the search for the time variation of fundamental constants of nature.

Isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines
The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines is the energy or frequency shift in atomic spectra, which occurs when one replaces one nuclear isomer by another. The effect was predicted by Richard M. Weiner in 1956, whose calculations showed that it should be measurable by atomic (optical) spectroscopy (see also). It was observed experimentally for the first time in 1958. The theory of the atomic isomeric shift is also used in the interpretation of the Mössbauer isomeric shift.

Terminology
The notion of isomer also appears in other fields such as chemistry and meteorology. Therefore, in the first publications devoted to this effect the name nuclear isomeric shift on spectral lines was used. Before the discovery of the Mössbauer effect, the isomeric shift referred exclusively to atomic spectra; this explains the absence of the word atomic in the initial definition of the effect. Subsequently, the isomeric shift was also observed in gamma spectroscopy through the Mössbauer effect and was called Mössbauer isomeric shift. For further details on the history of the isomeric shift and the terminology used, see .

Isotopic versus isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines
Atomic spectral lines are due to transitions of electrons between different atomic energy levels E, followed by emission of photons. Atomic levels are a manifestation of the electromagnetic interaction between electrons and nuclei. The energy levels of two atoms, the nuclei of which are different isotopes of the same element, are shifted one with respect to the other, despite the fact that the electric charges Z of the two isotopes are identical. This is so because isotopes differ by the number of neutrons, and therefore the masses and volumes of two isotopes are different; these differences give rise to the isotopic shift on atomic spectral lines.

In the case of two nuclear isomers, the number of protons and the number of neutrons are identical, but the quantum states and in particular the energy levels of the two nuclear isomers differ. This difference induces a difference in the electric charge distributions of two isomers and thus a difference δφ in the corresponding electrostatic nuclear potentials φ, which ultimately leads to a difference ΔE in the atomic energy levels. The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines is then given by
 
where ψ is the wave function of the electron involved in the transition, e its electric charge, and the integration is performed over the electron coordinates.

The isotopic and the isomeric shift are similar in the sense that both are effects in which the finite size of the nucleus manifests itself and both are due to a difference in the electromagnetic interaction energy between the electrons and the nucleus of the atom. The isotopic shift had been known decades before the isomeric shift and provided useful but limited information about atomic nuclei. Unlike the isomeric shift, the isotopic shift was at first discovered in experiment and then interpreted theoretically (see also ). While in the case of the isotopic shift the determination of the interaction energy between electrons and nuclei is a relatively simple electromagnetic problem, for isomers the problem is more involved, since it is the strong interaction, which accounts for the isomeric excitation of the nucleus and thus for the difference of charge distributions of the two isomeric states. This circumstance explains in part why the nuclear isomeric shift was not discovered earlier: the appropriate nuclear theory and in particular the nuclear shell model were developed only in the late 1940s and early 1950s. As to the experimental observation of this shift, it also had to await the development of a new technique, that permitted spectroscopy with isomers, which are metastable nuclei. This too happened only in the 1950s.

While the isomeric shift is sensitive to the internal structure of the nucleus, the isotopic shift is (in a good approximation) not. Therefore, the nuclear physics information that can be obtained from the investigation of the isomeric shift, is superior to what can be obtained from isotopic-shift studies. The measurements through the isomeric shift of e.g. the difference of nuclear radii of the excited and ground state constitute one of the most sensitive tests of nuclear models. Moreover, combined with the Mössbauer effect, the isomeric shift constitutes at present a unique tool in many other fields besides physics.

The nuclear shell model
According to the nuclear shell model, there exists a class of isomers, for which, in a first approximation, it is sufficient to consider one single nucleon, called the ""optical"" nucleon, to get an estimate of the difference between the charge distributions of the two isomer states, the rest of the nucleons being filtered out. This applies in particular for isomers in odd-proton–even-neutron nuclei, with nearly closed shells. Indium-115, for which the effect was calculated, is such an example. The result of the calculation was that the isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, although rather small, turned out to be two orders of magnitude bigger than a typical natural line width, which constitutes the limit of optical measurability.

The shift measured three years later in Hg-197 was quite close to that calculated for In-115, although in Hg-197, unlike in In-115, the optical nucleon is a neutron instead of a proton, and the electron–free-neutron interaction is much smaller than the electron—free-proton interaction. This is a consequence of the fact that the optical nucleons are not free, but bound particles. Thus the results could be explained within the theory by associating with the odd optical neutron an effective electric charge of Z/A.

The Mössbauer isomeric shift
The Mössbauer isomeric shift is the shift seen in gamma-ray spectroscopy when one compares two different nuclear isomeric states in two different physical, chemical or biological environments, and is due to the combined effect of the recoil-free Mössbauer transition between the two nuclear isomeric states and the transition between two atomic states in those two environments.

The isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines depends on the electron wave function ψ and on the difference δφ of electrostatic potentials φ of the two isomeric states.

For a given nuclear isomer in two different physical or chemical environments (different physical phases or different chemical combinations), the electron wave functions are also different. Therefore, on top of the isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, which is due to the difference of the two nuclear isomer states, there will be a shift between the two environments (because of the experimental arrangement, these are called source (s) and absorber (a)). This combined shift is the Mössbauer isomeric shift, and it is described mathematically by the same formalism as the nuclear isomeric shift on atomic spectral lines, except that instead of one electron wave function, that in the source ψs, one deals with the difference between the electron wave function in the source ψs and the electron wave function in the absorber ψa:
 

The first measurement of the isomeric shift in gamma spectroscopy with the help of the Mössbauer effect was reported in 1960, two years after its first experimental observation in atomic spectroscopy. By measuring this shift, one obtains important and extremely precise information, both about the nuclear isomer states and about the physical, chemical or biological environment of the atoms, represented by the electronic wave functions.

Under its Mössbauer variant, the isomeric shift has found important applications in domains as different as atomic physics, solid-state physics, nuclear physics, chemistry, biology, metallurgy, mineralogy, geology, and lunar research. For further literature, see also .

The nuclear isomeric shift has also been observed in muonic atoms, that is, atoms in which a muon is captured by the excited nucleus and makes a transition from an atomic excited state to the atomic ground state in a time shorter than the lifetime of the excited isomeric nuclear state.

"Sigmund Freud

Sigmund Freud ( ; ; born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 – 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst.

Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austrian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938, Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939.

In founding psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression. On this basis Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id, ego and super-ego. Freud postulated the existence of libido, a sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a death drive, the source of compulsive repetition, hate, aggression and neurotic guilt. In his later works, Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture.

Though in overall decline as a diagnostic and clinical practice, psychoanalysis remains influential within psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy, and across the humanities. It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate with regard to its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or is detrimental to the feminist cause. Nonetheless, Freud's work has suffused contemporary Western thought and popular culture. W. H. Auden's 1940 poetic tribute to Freud describes him as having created ""a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives.""

Biography

Early life and education

Freud was born to Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austrian Empire (later Příbor, Czech Republic), the first of eight children. Both of his parents were from Galicia, a province straddling modern-day West Ukraine and Poland. His father, Jakob Freud (1815–1896), a wool merchant, had two sons, Emanuel (1833–1914) and Philipp (1836–1911), by his first marriage. Jakob's family were Hasidic Jews, and although Jakob himself had moved away from the tradition, he came to be known for his Torah study. He and Freud's mother, Amalia Nathansohn, who was 20 years younger and his third wife, were married by Rabbi Isaac Noah Mannheimer on 29 July 1855. They were struggling financially and living in a rented room, in a locksmith's house at Schlossergasse 117 when their son Sigmund was born. He was born with a caul, which his mother saw as a positive omen for the boy's future.

In 1859, the Freud family left Freiberg. Freud's half brothers emigrated to Manchester, England, parting him from the ""inseparable"" playmate of his early childhood, Emanuel's son, John. Jakob Freud took his wife and two children (Freud's sister, Anna, was born in 1858; a brother, Julius born in 1857, had died in infancy) firstly to Leipzig and then in 1860 to Vienna where four sisters and a brother were born: Rosa (b. 1860), Marie (b. 1861), Adolfine (b. 1862), Paula (b. 1864), Alexander (b. 1866). In 1865, the nine-year-old Freud entered the Leopoldstädter Kommunal-Realgymnasium, a prominent high school. He proved to be an outstanding pupil and graduated from the Matura in 1873 with honors. He loved literature and was proficient in German, French, Italian, Spanish, English, Hebrew, Latin and Greek.

Freud entered the University of Vienna at age 17. He had planned to study law, but joined the medical faculty at the university, where his studies included philosophy under Franz Brentano, physiology under Ernst Brücke, and zoology under Darwinist professor Carl Claus. In 1876, Freud spent four weeks at Claus's zoological research station in Trieste, dissecting hundreds of eels in an inconclusive search for their male reproductive organs. In 1877 Freud moved to Ernst Brücke's physiology laboratory where he spent six years comparing the brains of humans and other vertebrates with those of frogs and invertebrates such as crayfish and lampreys. His research work on the biology of nervous tissue proved seminal for the subsequent discovery of the neuron in the 1890s. Freud's research work was interrupted in 1879 by the obligation to undertake a year's compulsory military service. The lengthy downtimes enabled him to complete a commission to translate four essays from John Stuart Mill's collected works. He graduated with an MD in March 1881.

Early career and marriage
In 1882, Freud began his medical career at the Vienna General Hospital. His research work in cerebral anatomy led to the publication of an influential paper on the palliative effects of cocaine in 1884 and his work on aphasia would form the basis of his first book On the Aphasias: a Critical Study, published in 1891. Over a three-year period, Freud worked in various departments of the hospital. His time spent in Theodor Meynert's psychiatric clinic and as a locum in a local asylum led to an increased interest in clinical work. His substantial body of published research led to his appointment as a university lecturer or docent in neuropathology in 1885, a non-salaried post but one which entitled him to give lectures at the University of Vienna.

In 1886, Freud resigned his hospital post and entered private practice specializing in ""nervous disorders"". The same year he married Martha Bernays, the granddaughter of Isaac Bernays, a chief rabbi in Hamburg. They had six children: Mathilde (b. 1887), Jean-Martin (b. 1889), Oliver (b. 1891), Ernst (b. 1892), Sophie (b. 1893), and Anna (b. 1895). From 1891 until they left Vienna in 1938, Freud and his family lived in an apartment at Berggasse 19, near Innere Stadt, a historical district of Vienna.

In 1896, Minna Bernays, Martha Freud's sister, became a permanent member of the Freud household after the death of her fiancé. The close relationship she formed with Freud led to rumours, started by Carl Jung, of an affair. The discovery of a Swiss hotel log of 13 August 1898, signed by Freud whilst travelling with his sister-in-law, has been presented as evidence of the affair.

Freud began smoking tobacco at age 24; initially a cigarette smoker, he became a cigar smoker. He believed smoking enhanced his capacity to work and that he could exercise self-control in moderating it. Despite health warnings from colleague Wilhelm Fliess, he remained a smoker, eventually suffering a buccal cancer. Freud suggested to Fliess in 1897 that addictions, including that to tobacco, were substitutes for masturbation, ""the one great habit.""

Freud had greatly admired his philosophy tutor, Brentano, who was known for his theories of perception and introspection. Brentano discussed the possible existence of the unconscious mind in his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874). Although Brentano denied its existence, his discussion of the unconscious probably helped introduce Freud to the concept. Freud owned and made use of Charles Darwin's major evolutionary writings, and was also influenced by Eduard von Hartmann's The Philosophy of the Unconscious (1869). Other texts of importance to Freud were by Fechner and Herbart with the latter's Psychology as Science arguably considered to be of underrated significance in this respect. Freud also drew on the work of Theodor Lipps who was one of the main contemporary theorists of the concepts of the unconscious and empathy.

Though Freud was reluctant to associate his psychoanalytic insights with prior philosophical theories, attention has been drawn to analogies between his work and that of both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, both of whom he claimed not to have read until late in life. One historian concluded, based on Freud's correspondence with his adolescent friend Eduard Silberstein, that Freud read Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy and the first two of the Untimely Meditations when he was seventeen. In 1900, the year of Nietzsche's death, Freud bought his collected works; he told his friend, Fliess, that he hoped to find in Nietzsche's works ""the words for much that remains mute in me."" Later, he said he had not yet opened them. Freud came to treat Nietzsche's writings ""as texts to be resisted far more than to be studied."" His interest in philosophy declined after he had decided on a career in neurology.

Freud read William Shakespeare in English throughout his life, and it has been suggested that his understanding of human psychology may have been partially derived from Shakespeare's plays.

Freud's Jewish origins and his allegiance to his secular Jewish identity were of significant influence in the formation of his intellectual and moral outlook, especially with respect to his intellectual non-conformism, as he was the first to point out in his Autobiographical Study. They would also have a substantial effect on the content of psychoanalytic ideas, particularly in respect of their common concerns with depth interpretation and ""the bounding of desire by law"".

Development of psychoanalysis

In October 1885, Freud went to Paris on a three-month fellowship to study with Jean-Martin Charcot, a renowned neurologist who was conducting scientific research into hypnosis. He was later to recall the experience of this stay as catalytic in turning him toward the practice of medical psychopathology and away from a less financially promising career in neurology research. Charcot specialized in the study of hysteria and susceptibility to hypnosis, which he frequently demonstrated with patients on stage in front of an audience.

Once he had set up in private practice back in Vienna in 1886, Freud began using hypnosis in his clinical work. He adopted the approach of his friend and collaborator, Josef Breuer, in a type of hypnosis which was different from the French methods he had studied, in that it did not use suggestion. The treatment of one particular patient of Breuer's proved to be transformative for Freud's clinical practice. Described as Anna O., she was invited to talk about her symptoms while under hypnosis (she would coin the phrase ""talking cure"" for her treatment). In the course of talking in this way, her symptoms became reduced in severity as she retrieved memories of traumatic incidents associated with their onset.

The inconsistent results of Freud's early clinical work eventually led him to abandon hypnosis, having concluded that more consistent and effective symptom relief could be achieved by encouraging patients to talk freely, without censorship or inhibition, about whatever ideas or memories occurred to them. In conjunction with this procedure, which he called ""free association"", Freud found that patients' dreams could be fruitfully analyzed to reveal the complex structuring of unconscious material and to demonstrate the psychic action of repression which, he had concluded, underlay symptom formation. By 1896 he was using the term ""psychoanalysis"" to refer to his new clinical method and the theories on which it was based.

Freud's development of these new theories took place during a period in which he experienced heart irregularities, disturbing dreams and periods of depression, a ""neurasthenia"" which he linked to the death of his father in 1896 and which prompted a ""self-analysis"" of his own dreams and memories of childhood. His explorations of his feelings of hostility to his father and rivalrous jealousy over his mother's affections led him to fundamentally revise his theory of the origin of the neuroses.

On the basis of his early clinical work, Freud had postulated that unconscious memories of sexual molestation in early childhood were a necessary precondition for the psychoneuroses (hysteria and obsessional neurosis), a formulation now known as Freud's seduction theory. In the light of his self-analysis, Freud abandoned the theory that every neurosis can be traced back to the effects of infantile sexual abuse, now arguing that infantile sexual scenarios still had a causative function, but it did not matter whether they were real or imagined and that in either case they became pathogenic only when acting as repressed memories.

This transition from the theory of infantile sexual trauma as a general explanation of how all neuroses originate to one that presupposes an autonomous infantile sexuality provided the basis for Freud's subsequent formulation of the theory of the Oedipus complex.

Freud described the evolution of his clinical method and set out his theory of the psychogenetic origins of hysteria, demonstrated in a number of case histories, in Studies on Hysteria published in 1895 (co-authored with Josef Breuer). In 1899 he published The Interpretation of Dreams in which, following a critical review of existing theory, Freud gives detailed interpretations of his own and his patients' dreams in terms of wish-fulfillments made subject to the repression and censorship of the ""dream work"". He then sets out the theoretical model of mental structure (the unconscious, pre-conscious and conscious) on which this account is based. An abridged version, On Dreams, was published in 1901. In works which would win him a more general readership, Freud applied his theories outside the clinical setting in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (1901) and Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious (1905). In Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, published in 1905, Freud elaborates his theory of infantile sexuality, describing its ""polymorphous perverse"" forms and the functioning of the ""drives"", to which it gives rise, in the formation of sexual identity. The same year he published Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria, which became one of his more famous and controversial case studies.

Relationship with Fliess

During this formative period of his work, Freud valued and came to rely on the intellectual and emotional support of his friend Wilhelm Fliess, a Berlin-based ear, nose and throat specialist whom he had first met 1887. Both men saw themselves as isolated from the prevailing clinical and theoretical mainstream because of their ambitions to develop radical new theories of sexuality. Fliess developed highly eccentric theories of human biorhythms and a nasogenital connection which are today considered pseudoscientific. He shared Freud's views on the importance of certain aspects of sexuality — masturbation, coitus interruptus, and the use of condoms — in the etiology of what were then called the ""actual neuroses,"" primarily neurasthenia and certain physically manifested anxiety symptoms. They maintained an extensive correspondence from which Freud drew on Fliess's speculations on infantile sexuality and bisexuality to elaborate and revise his own ideas. His first attempt at a systematic theory of the mind, his Project for a Scientific Psychology was developed as a metapsychology with Fliess as interlocutor. However, Freud's efforts to build a bridge between neurology and psychology were eventually abandoned after they had reached an impasse, as his letters to Fliess reveal, though some ideas of the Project were to be taken up again in the concluding chapter of The Interpretation of Dreams.

Freud had Fliess repeatedly operate on his nose and sinuses to treat ""nasal reflex neurosis"", and subsequently referred his patient Emma Eckstein to him. According to Freud, her history of symptoms included severe leg pains with consequent restricted mobility, as well as stomach and menstrual pains. These pains were, according to Fliess's theories, caused by habitual masturbation which, as the tissue of the nose and genitalia were linked, was curable by removal of part of the middle turbinate. Fliess's surgery proved disastrous, resulting in profuse, recurrent nasal bleeding – he had left a half-metre of gauze in Eckstein's nasal cavity - the subsequent removal of which left her permanently disfigured. At first, though aware of Fliess's culpability – Freud fled from the remedial surgery in horror – he could only bring himself to delicately intimate in his correspondence to Fliess the nature of his disastrous role and in subsequent letters maintained a tactful silence on the matter or else returned to the face-saving topic of Eckstein's hysteria. Freud ultimately, in light of Eckstein's history of adolescent self-cutting and irregular nasal (and menstrual) bleeding, concluded that Fliess was ""completely without blame"", as Eckstein's post-operative haemorrhages were hysterical ""wish-bleedings"" linked to ""an old wish to be loved in her illness"" and triggered as a means of ""rearousing [Freud's] affection"". Eckstein nonetheless continued her analysis with Freud. She was restored to full mobility and went on to practice psychoanalysis herself.

Freud, who had called Fliess ""the Kepler of biology"", later concluded that a combination of a homoerotic attachment and the residue of his ""specifically Jewish mysticism"" lay behind his loyalty to his Jewish friend and his consequent over-estimation of both his theoretical and clinical work. Their friendship came to an acrimonious end with Fliess angry at Freud's unwillingness to endorse his general theory of sexual periodicity and accusing him of collusion in the plagiarism of his work. After Fliess failed to respond to Freud's offer of collaboration over publication of his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in 1906, their relationship came to an end.

Early followers

In 1902, Freud at last realised his long-standing ambition to be made a university professor. The title ""professor extraordinarius"" was important to Freud for the recognition and prestige it conferred, there being no salary or teaching duties attached to the post (he would be granted the enhanced status of ""professor ordinarius"" in 1920). Despite support from the university, his appointment had been blocked in successive years by the political authorities and it was secured only with the intervention of one of his more influential ex-patients, a Baroness Marie Ferstel, who (supposedly) had to bribe the minister of education with a valuable painting.

With his prestige thus enhanced, Freud continued with the regular series of lectures on his work which, since the mid-1880s as a docent of Vienna University, he had been delivering to small audiences every Saturday evening at the lecture hall of the university's psychiatric clinic.

From the autumn of 1902, a number of Viennese physicians who had expressed interest in Freud's work were invited to meet at his apartment every Wednesday afternoon to discuss issues relating to psychology and neuropathology. This group was called the Wednesday Psychological Society (Psychologische Mittwochs-Gesellschaft) and it marked the beginnings of the worldwide psychoanalytic movement.

Freud founded this discussion group at the suggestion of the physician Wilhelm Stekel. Stekel had studied medicine at the University of Vienna under Richard von Krafft-Ebing. His conversion to psychoanalysis is variously attributed to his successful treatment by Freud for a sexual problem or as a result of his reading The Interpretation of Dreams, to which he subsequently gave a positive review in the Viennese daily newspaper Neues Wiener Tagblatt.

The other three original members whom Freud invited to attend, Alfred Adler, Max Kahane, and Rudolf Reitler, were also physicians and all five were Jewish by birth. Both Kahane and Reitler were childhood friends of Freud. Kahane had attended the same secondary school and both he and Reitler went to university with Freud. They had kept abreast of Freud's developing ideas through their attendance at his Saturday evening lectures. In 1901, Kahane, who first introduced Stekel to Freud's work, had opened an out-patient psychotherapy institute of which he was the director in Bauernmarkt, in Vienna. In the same year, his medical textbook, Outline of Internal Medicine for Students and Practicing Physicians, was published. In it, he provided an outline of Freud's psychoanalytic method. Kahane broke with Freud and left the Wednesday Psychological Society in 1907 for unknown reasons and in 1923 committed suicide. Reitler was the director of an establishment providing thermal cures in Dorotheergasse which had been founded in 1901. He died prematurely in 1917. Adler, regarded as the most formidable intellect among the early Freud circle, was a socialist who in 1898 had written a health manual for the tailoring trade. He was particularly interested in the potential social impact of psychiatry.

Max Graf, a Viennese musicologist and father of ""Little Hans"", who had first encountered Freud in 1900 and joined the Wednesday group soon after its initial inception, described the ritual and atmosphere of the early meetings of the society:

The gatherings followed a definite ritual. First one of the members would present a paper. Then, black coffee and cakes were served; cigar and cigarettes were on the table and were consumed in great quantities. After a social quarter of an hour, the discussion would begin. The last and decisive word was always spoken by Freud himself. There was the atmosphere of the foundation of a religion in that room. Freud himself was its new prophet who made the heretofore prevailing methods of psychological investigation appear superficial.

By 1906, the group had grown to sixteen members, including Otto Rank, who was employed as the group's paid secretary. In the same year, Freud began a correspondence with Carl Gustav Jung who was by then already an academically acclaimed researcher into word-association and the Galvanic Skin Response, and a lecturer at Zurich University, although still only an assistant to Eugen Bleuler at the Burghölzli Mental Hospital in Zürich. In March 1907, Jung and Ludwig Binswanger, also a Swiss psychiatrist, travelled to Vienna to visit Freud and attend the discussion group. Thereafter, they established a small psychoanalytic group in Zürich. In 1908, reflecting its growing institutional status, the Wednesday group was reconstituted as the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society with Freud as President, a position he relinquished in 1910 in favor of Adler in the hope of neutralizing his increasingly critical standpoint.

The first woman member, Margarete Hilferding, joined the Society in 1910 and the following year she was joined by Tatiana Rosenthal and Sabina Spielrein who were both Russian psychiatrists and graduates of the Zürich University medical school. Prior to the completion of her studies, Spielrein had been a patient of Jung at the Burghölzli and the clinical and personal details of their relationship became the subject of an extensive correspondence between Freud and Jung. Both women would go on to make important contributions to the work of the Russian Psychoanalytic Society founded in 1910.

Freud's early followers met together formally for the first time at the Hotel Bristol, Salzburg on 27 April 1908. This meeting, which was retrospectively deemed to be the first International Psychoanalytic Congress, was convened at the suggestion of Ernest Jones, then a London-based neurologist who had discovered Freud's writings and begun applying psychoanalytic methods in his clinical work. Jones had met Jung at a conference the previous year and they met up again in Zürich to organize the Congress. There were, as Jones records, ""forty-two present, half of whom were or became practicing analysts."" In addition to Jones and the Viennese and Zürich contingents accompanying Freud and Jung, also present and notable for their subsequent importance in the psychoanalytic movement were Karl Abraham and Max Eitingon from Berlin, Sándor Ferenczi from Budapest and the New York-based Abraham Brill.

Important decisions were taken at the Congress with a view to advancing the impact of Freud's work. A journal, the Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische und psychopathologishe Forschungen, was launched in 1909 under the editorship of Jung. This was followed in 1910 by the monthly Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse edited by Adler and Stekel, in 1911 by Imago, a journal devoted to the application of psychoanalysis to the field of cultural and literary studies edited by Rank and in 1913 by the Internationale Zeitschrift für Psychoanalyse, also edited by Rank. Plans for an international association of psychoanalysts were put in place and these were implemented at the Nuremberg Congress of 1910 where Jung was elected, with Freud's support, as its first president.

Freud turned to Brill and Jones to further his ambition to spread the psychoanalytic cause in the English-speaking world. Both were invited to Vienna following the Salzburg Congress and a division of labour was agreed with Brill given the translation rights for Freud's works, and Jones, who was to take up a post at the University of Toronto later in the year, tasked with establishing a platform for Freudian ideas in North American academic and medical life. Jones's advocacy prepared the way for Freud's visit to the United States, accompanied by Jung and Ferenczi, in September 1909 at the invitation of Stanley Hall, president of Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, where he gave five lectures on psychoanalysis.

The event, at which Freud was awarded an Honorary Doctorate, marked the first public recognition of Freud's work and attracted widespread media interest. Freud's audience included the distinguished neurologist and psychiatrist James Jackson Putnam, Professor of Diseases of the Nervous System at Harvard, who invited Freud to his country retreat where they held extensive discussions over a period of four days. Putnam's subsequent public endorsement of Freud's work represented a significant breakthrough for the psychoanalytic cause in the United States. When Putnam and Jones organised the founding of the American Psychoanalytic Association in May 1911 they were elected president and secretary respectively. Brill founded the New York Psychoanalytic Society the same year. His English translations of Freud's work began to appear from 1909.

Resignations from the IPA
Some of Freud's followers subsequently withdrew from the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) and founded their own schools.

From 1909, Adler's views on topics such as neurosis began to differ markedly from those held by Freud. As Adler's position appeared increasingly incompatible with Freudianism, a series of confrontations between their respective viewpoints took place at the meetings of the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society in January and February 1911. In February 1911, Adler, then the president of the society, resigned his position. At this time, Stekel also resigned his position as vice president of the society. Adler finally left the Freudian group altogether in June 1911 to found his own organization with nine other members who had also resigned from the group. This new formation was initially called Society for Free Psychoanalysis but it was soon renamed the Society for Individual Psychology. In the period after World War I, Adler became increasingly associated with a psychological position he devised called individual psychology.

In 1912, Jung published Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (published in English in 1916 as Psychology of the Unconscious) making it clear that his views were taking a direction quite different from those of Freud. To distinguish his system from psychoanalysis, Jung called it analytical psychology. Anticipating the final breakdown of the relationship between Freud and Jung, Ernest Jones initiated the formation of a secret Committee of loyalists charged with safeguarding the theoretical coherence and institutional legacy of the psychoanalytic movement. Formed in the autumn of 1912, the Committee comprised Freud, Jones, Abraham, Ferenczi, Rank, and Hanns Sachs. Max Eitingon joined the Committee in 1919. Each member pledged himself not to make any public departure from the fundamental tenets of psychoanalytic theory before he had discussed his views with the others. After this development, Jung recognised that his position was untenable and resigned as editor of the Jarhbuch and then as president of the IPA in April 1914. The Zürich Society withdrew from the IPA the following July.

Later the same year, Freud published a paper entitled ""The History of the Psychoanalytic Movement"", the German original being first published in the Jahrbuch, giving his view on the birth and evolution of the psychoanalytic movement and the withdrawal of Adler and Jung from it.

The final defection from Freud's inner circle occurred following the publication in 1924 of Rank's The Trauma of Birth which other members of the committee read as, in effect, abandoning the Oedipus Complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytic theory. Abraham and Jones became increasingly forceful critics of Rank and though he and Freud were reluctant to end their close and long-standing relationship the break finally came in 1926 when Rank resigned from his official posts in the IPA and left Vienna for Paris. His place on the committee was taken by Anna Freud. Rank eventually settled in the United States where his revisions of Freudian theory were to influence a new generation of therapists uncomfortable with the orthodoxies of the IPA.

Early psychoanalytic movement

After the founding of the IPA in 1910, an international network of psychoanalytical societies, training institutes and clinics became well established and a regular schedule of biannual Congresses commenced after the end of World War I to coordinate their activities.

Abraham and Eitingon founded the Berlin Psychoanalytic Society in 1910 and then the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute and the Poliklinik in 1920. The Poliklinik's innovations of free treatment, and child analysis and the Berlin Institute's standardisation of psychoanalytic training had a major influence on the wider psychoanalytic movement. In 1927 Ernst Simmel founded the Schloss Tegel Sanatorium on the outskirts of Berlin, the first such establishment to provide psychoanalytic treatment in an institutional framework. Freud organised a fund to help finance its activities and his architect son, Ernst, was commissioned to refurbish the building. It was forced to close in 1931 for economic reasons.

The 1910 Moscow Psychoanalytic Society became the Russian Psychoanalytic Society and Institute in 1922. Freud's Russian followers were the first to benefit from translations of his work, the 1904 Russian translation of The Interpretation of Dreams appearing nine years before Brill's English edition. The Russian Institute was unique in receiving state support for its activities, including publication of translations of Freud's works. Support was abruptly annulled in 1924, when Joseph Stalin came to power, after which psychoanalysis was denounced on ideological grounds.

After helping found the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1911, Ernest Jones returned to Britain from Canada in 1913 and founded the London Psychoanalytic Society the same year. In 1919, he dissolved this organisation and, with its core membership purged of Jungian adherents, founded the British Psychoanalytical Society, serving as its president until 1944. The Institute of Psychoanalysis was established 1924 and the London Clinic of Psychoanalysis established in 1926, both under Jones's directorship.

The Vienna Ambulatorium (Clinic) was established in 1922 and the Vienna Psychoanalytic Institute was founded in 1924 under the directorship of Helene Deutsch. Ferenczi founded the Budapest Psychoanalytic Institute in 1913 and a clinic in 1929.

Psychoanalytic societies and institutes were established in Switzerland (1919), France (1926), Italy (1932), the Netherlands (1933), Norway (1933) and in Palestine (Jerusalem, 1933) by Eitingon, who had fled Berlin after Adolf Hitler came to power. The New York Psychoanalytic Institute was founded in 1931.

The 1922 Berlin Congress was the last Freud attended. By this time his speech had become seriously impaired by the prosthetic device he needed as a result of a series of operations on his cancerous jaw. He kept abreast of developments through a regular correspondence with his principal followers and via the circular letters and meetings of the secret Committee which he continued to attend.

The Committee continued to function until 1927 by which time institutional developments within the IPA, such as the establishment of the International Training Commission, had addressed concerns about the transmission of psychoanalytic theory and practice. There remained, however, significant differences over the issue of lay analysis – i.e. the acceptance of non-medically qualified candidates for psychoanalytic training. Freud set out his case in favour in 1926 in his The Question of Lay Analysis. He was resolutely opposed by the American societies who expressed concerns over professional standards and the risk of litigation (though child analysts were made exempt). These concerns were also shared by some of his European colleagues. Eventually an agreement was reached allowing societies autonomy in setting criteria for candidature.

In 1930 Freud was awarded the Goethe Prize in recognition of his contributions to psychology and to German literary culture.

Patients
Freud used pseudonyms in his case histories. Some patients known by pseudonyms were Cäcilie M. (Anna von Lieben); Dora (Ida Bauer, 1882–1945); Frau Emmy von N. (Fanny Moser); Fräulein Elisabeth von R. (Ilona Weiss); Fräulein Katharina (Aurelia Kronich); Fräulein Lucy R.; Little Hans (Herbert Graf, 1903–1973); Rat Man (Ernst Lanzer, 1878–1914); Enos Fingy (Joshua Wild, 1878–1920); and Wolf Man (Sergei Pankejeff, 1887–1979). Other famous patients included Prince Pedro Augusto of Brazil (1866–1934); H.D. (1886–1961); Emma Eckstein (1865–1924); Gustav Mahler (1860–1911), with whom Freud had only a single, extended consultation; Princess Marie Bonaparte; Edith Banfield Jackson (1895–1977); and Albert Hirst (1887–1974).

Cancer
In February 1923, Freud detected a leukoplakia, a benign growth associated with heavy smoking, on his mouth. He initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, telling him that the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the dermatologist Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism ""a bad leukoplakia"" instead of the technical diagnosis epithelioma. Deutsch advised Freud to stop smoking and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a rhinologist whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's outpatient department. Freud bled during and after the operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.

Escape from Nazism
In January 1933, the Nazi Party took control of Germany, and Freud's books were prominent among those they burned and destroyed. Freud remarked to Ernest Jones: ""What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now, they are content with burning my books."" Freud continued to underestimate the growing Nazi threat and remained determined to stay in Vienna, even following the Anschluss of 13 March 1938, in which Nazi Germany annexed Austria, and the outbreaks of violent antisemitism that ensued. Jones, the then president of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA), flew into Vienna from London via Prague on 15 March determined to get Freud to change his mind and seek exile in Britain. This prospect and the shock of the arrest and interrogation of Anna Freud by the Gestapo finally convinced Freud it was time to leave Austria. Jones left for London the following week with a list provided by Freud of the party of émigrés for whom immigration permits would be required. Back in London, Jones used his personal acquaintance with the Home Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare, to expedite the granting of permits. There were seventeen in all and work permits were provided where relevant. Jones also used his influence in scientific circles, persuading the president of the Royal Society, Sir William Bragg, to write to the Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, requesting to good effect that diplomatic pressure be applied in Berlin and Vienna on Freud's behalf. Freud also had support from American diplomats, notably his ex-patient and American ambassador to France, William Bullitt. Bullitt alerted U.S. President Roosevelt to the increased dangers facing the Freuds, resulting in the American consul-general in Vienna, John Cooper Wiley, arranging regular monitoring of Berggasse 19. He also intervened by phone call during the Gestapo interrogation of Anna Freud.

The departure from Vienna began in stages throughout April and May 1938. Freud's grandson Ernst Halberstadt and Freud's son Martin's wife and children left for Paris in April. Freud's sister-in-law, Minna Bernays, left for London on 5 May, Martin Freud the following week and Freud's daughter Mathilde and her husband, Robert Hollitscher, on 24 May.

By the end of the month, arrangements for Freud's own departure for London had become stalled, mired in a legally tortuous and financially extortionate process of negotiation with the Nazi authorities. Under regulations imposed on its Jewish population by the new Nazi regime, a Kommissar was appointed to manage Freud's assets and those of the IPA whose headquarters were nearby Freud's home. Freud was allocated to Dr. Anton Sauerwald, who had studied chemistry at Vienna University under Professor Josef Herzig, an old friend of Freud's. Sauerwald read Freud's books to further learn about him and became sympathetic towards his situation. Though required to disclose details of all Freud's bank accounts to his superiors and to arrange the destruction of the historic library of books housed in the offices of the IPA, Sauerwald did neither. Instead he removed evidence of Freud's foreign bank accounts to his own safe-keeping and arranged the storage of the IPA library in the Austrian National Library where it remained until the end of the war.

Though Sauerwald's intervention lessened the financial burden of the ""flight"" tax on Freud's declared assets, other substantial charges were levied in relation to the debts of the IPA and the valuable collection of antiquities Freud possessed. Unable to access his own accounts, Freud turned to Princess Marie Bonaparte, the most eminent and wealthy of his French followers, who had travelled to Vienna to offer her support and it was she who made the necessary funds available. This allowed Sauerwald to sign the necessary exit visas for Freud, his wife Martha and daughter Anna. They left Vienna on the Orient Express on 4 June, accompanied by their housekeeper and a doctor, arriving in Paris the following day where they stayed as guests of Marie Bonaparte before travelling overnight to London arriving at London Victoria station on 6 June.

Among those soon to call on Freud to pay their respects were Salvador Dalí, Stefan Zweig, Leonard Woolf, Virginia Woolf and H. G. Wells. Representatives of the Royal Society called with the Society's Charter for Freud, who had been elected a Foreign Member in 1936, to sign himself into membership. Marie Bonaparte arrived towards the end of June to discuss the fate of Freud's four elderly sisters left behind in Vienna. Her subsequent attempts to get them exit visas failed and they would all die in Nazi concentration camps.

In early 1939 Sauerwald arrived in London in mysterious circumstances where he met Freud's brother Alexander. He was tried and imprisoned in 1945 by an Austrian court for his activities as a Nazi Party official. Responding to a plea from his wife, Anna Freud wrote to confirm that Sauerwald ""used his office as our appointed commissar in such a manner as to protect my father"". Her intervention helped secure his release from jail in 1947.

In the Freuds' new home, 20 Maresfield Gardens, Hampstead, North London, Freud's Vienna consulting room was recreated in faithful detail. He continued to see patients there until the terminal stages of his illness. He also worked on his last books, Moses and Monotheism, published in German in 1938 and in English the following year and the uncompleted An Outline of Psychoanalysis which was published posthumously.

Death

By mid-September 1939, Freud's cancer of the jaw was causing him increasingly severe pain and had been declared to be inoperable. The last book he read, Balzac's La Peau de chagrin, prompted reflections on his own increasing frailty and a few days later he turned to his doctor, friend and fellow refugee, Max Schur, reminding him that they had previously discussed the terminal stages of his illness: ""Schur, you remember our 'contract' not to leave me in the lurch when the time had come. Now it is nothing but torture and makes no sense."" When Schur replied that he had not forgotten, Freud said, ""I thank you,"" and then ""Talk it over with Anna, and if she thinks it's right, then make an end of it."" Anna Freud wanted to postpone her father's death, but Schur convinced her it was pointless to keep him alive and on 21 and 22 September administered doses of morphine that resulted in Freud's death around 3 am on 23 September 1939. However, discrepancies in the various accounts Schur gave of his role in Freud's final hours, which have in turn led to inconsistencies between Freud's main biographers, has led to further research and a revised account. This proposes that Schur was absent from Freud's deathbed when a third and final dose of morphine was administered by Dr Josephine Stross, a colleague of Anna Freud, leading to Freud's death around midnight on 23 September 1939.

Three days after his death Freud's body was cremated at the Golders Green Crematorium in North London, with Harrods acting as funeral directors, on the instructions of his son, Ernst. Funeral orations were given by Ernest Jones and the Austrian author Stefan Zweig. Freud's ashes were later placed in the crematorium's Ernest George Columbarium (see ""Freud Corner""). They rest on a plinth designed by his son, Ernst, in a sealed ancient Greek bell krater painted with Dionysian scenes that Freud had received as a gift from Marie Bonaparte and which he had kept in his study in Vienna for many years. After his wife, Martha, died in 1951, her ashes were also placed in the urn.

Ideas

Early work
Freud began his study of medicine at the University of Vienna in 1873. He took almost nine years to complete his studies, due to his interest in neurophysiological research, specifically investigation of the sexual anatomy of eels and the physiology of the fish nervous system, and because of his interest in studying philosophy with Franz Brentano. He entered private practice in neurology for financial reasons, receiving his M.D. degree in 1881 at the age of 25. Amongst his principal concerns in the 1880s was the anatomy of the brain, specifically the medulla oblongata. He intervened in the important debates about aphasia with his monograph of 1891, Zur Auffassung der Aphasien, in which he coined the term agnosia and counselled against a too locationist view of the explanation of neurological deficits. Like his contemporary Eugen Bleuler, he emphasized brain function rather than brain structure.

Freud was also an early researcher in the field of cerebral palsy, which was then known as ""cerebral paralysis"". He published several medical papers on the topic, and showed that the disease existed long before other researchers of the period began to notice and study it. He also suggested that William John Little, the man who first identified cerebral palsy, was wrong about lack of oxygen during birth being a cause. Instead, he suggested that complications in birth were only a symptom.

Freud hoped that his research would provide a solid scientific basis for his therapeutic technique. The goal of Freudian therapy, or psychoanalysis, was to bring repressed thoughts and feelings into consciousness in order to free the patient from suffering repetitive distorted emotions.

Classically, the bringing of unconscious thoughts and feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so. Another important element of psychoanalysis is transference, the process by which patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud had come to see it as an essential part of the therapeutic process.

The origin of Freud's early work with psychoanalysis can be linked to Josef Breuer. Freud credited Breuer with opening the way to the discovery of the psychoanalytical method by his treatment of the case of Anna O. In November 1880, Breuer was called in to treat a highly intelligent 21-year-old woman (Bertha Pappenheim) for a persistent cough that he diagnosed as hysterical. He found that while nursing her dying father, she had developed a number of transitory symptoms, including visual disorders and paralysis and contractures of limbs, which he also diagnosed as hysterical. Breuer began to see his patient almost every day as the symptoms increased and became more persistent, and observed that she entered states of absence. He found that when, with his encouragement, she told fantasy stories in her evening states of absence her condition improved, and most of her symptoms had disappeared by April 1881. Following the death of her father in that month her condition deteriorated again. Breuer recorded that some of the symptoms eventually remitted spontaneously, and that full recovery was achieved by inducing her to recall events that had precipitated the occurrence of a specific symptom. In the years immediately following Breuer's treatment, Anna O. spent three short periods in sanatoria with the diagnosis ""hysteria"" with ""somatic symptoms"", and some authors have challenged Breuer's published account of a cure. Richard Skues rejects this interpretation, which he sees as stemming from both Freudian and anti-psychoanalytical revisionism, that regards both Breuer's narrative of the case as unreliable and his treatment of Anna O. as a failure. Psychologist Frank Sulloway contends that ""Freud's case histories are rampant with censorship, distortions, highly dubious 'reconstructions,' and exaggerated claims.""

Seduction theory
In the early 1890s, Freud used a form of treatment based on the one that Breuer had described to him, modified by what he called his ""pressure technique"" and his newly developed analytic technique of interpretation and reconstruction. According to Freud's later accounts of this period, as a result of his use of this procedure most of his patients in the mid-1890s reported early childhood sexual abuse. He believed these stories, which he used as the basis for his seduction theory, but then he came to believe that they were fantasies. He explained these at first as having the function of ""fending off"" memories of infantile masturbation, but in later years he wrote that they represented Oedipal fantasies, stemming from innate drives that are sexual and destructive in nature.

Another version of events focuses on Freud's proposing that unconscious memories of infantile sexual abuse were at the root of the psychoneuroses in letters to Fliess in October 1895, before he reported that he had actually discovered such abuse among his patients. In the first half of 1896, Freud published three papers, which led to his seduction theory, stating that he had uncovered, in all of his current patients, deeply repressed memories of sexual abuse in early childhood. In these papers, Freud recorded that his patients were not consciously aware of these memories, and must therefore be present as unconscious memories if they were to result in hysterical symptoms or obsessional neurosis. The patients were subjected to considerable pressure to ""reproduce"" infantile sexual abuse ""scenes"" that Freud was convinced had been repressed into the unconscious. Patients were generally unconvinced that their experiences of Freud's clinical procedure indicated actual sexual abuse. He reported that even after a supposed ""reproduction"" of sexual scenes the patients assured him emphatically of their disbelief.

As well as his pressure technique, Freud's clinical procedures involved analytic inference and the symbolic interpretation of symptoms to trace back to memories of infantile sexual abuse. His claim of one hundred percent confirmation of his theory only served to reinforce previously expressed reservations from his colleagues about the validity of findings obtained through his suggestive techniques. Freud subsequently showed inconsistency as to whether his seduction theory was still compatible with his later findings. In an addendum to The Aetiology of Hysteria he stated: ""All this is true [the sexual abuse of children]; but it must be remembered that at the time I wrote it I had not yet freed myself from my overvaluation of reality and my low valuation of phantasy"". Some years later Freud explicitly rejected the claim of his colleague Ferenczi that his patients' reports of sexual molestation were actual memories instead of fantasies, and he tried to dissuade Ferenczi from making his views public. Karin Ahbel-Rappe concludes in her study ""'I no longer believe': did Freud abandon the seduction theory?"": ""Freud marked out and started down a trail of investigation into the nature of the experience of infantile incest and its impact on the human psyche, and then abandoned this direction for the most part.""

Cocaine
As a medical researcher, Freud was an early user and proponent of cocaine as a stimulant as well as analgesic. He believed that cocaine was a cure for many mental and physical problems, and in his 1884 paper ""On Coca"" he extolled its virtues. Between 1883 and 1887 he wrote several articles recommending medical applications, including its use as an antidepressant. He narrowly missed out on obtaining scientific priority for discovering its anesthetic properties of which he was aware but had mentioned only in passing. (Karl Koller, a colleague of Freud's in Vienna, received that distinction in 1884 after reporting to a medical society the ways cocaine could be used in delicate eye surgery.) Freud also recommended cocaine as a cure for morphine addiction. He had introduced cocaine to his friend Ernst von Fleischl-Marxow, who had become addicted to morphine taken to relieve years of excruciating nerve pain resulting from an infection acquired after injuring himself while performing an autopsy. His claim that Fleischl-Marxow was cured of his addiction was premature, though he never acknowledged that he had been at fault. Fleischl-Marxow developed an acute case of ""cocaine psychosis"", and soon returned to using morphine, dying a few years later still suffering from intolerable pain.

The application as an anesthetic turned out to be one of the few safe uses of cocaine, and as reports of addiction and overdose began to filter in from many places in the world, Freud's medical reputation became somewhat tarnished. After the ""Cocaine Episode"" Freud ceased to publicly recommend use of the drug, but continued to take it himself occasionally for depression, migraine and nasal inflammation during the early 1890s, before discontinuing its use in 1896.

The Unconscious

The concept of the unconscious was central to Freud's account of the mind. Freud believed that while poets and thinkers had long known of the existence of the unconscious, he had ensured that it received scientific recognition in the field of psychology.

Freud states explicitly that his concept of the unconscious as he first formulated it was based on the theory of repression. He postulated a cycle in which ideas are repressed, but remain in the mind, removed from consciousness yet operative, then reappear in consciousness under certain circumstances. The postulate was based upon the investigation of cases of hysteria, which revealed instances of behaviour in patients that could not be explained without reference to ideas or thoughts of which they had no awareness and which analysis revealed were linked to the (real or imagined) repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. In his later re-formulations of the concept of repression in his 1915 paper 'Repression' (Standard Edition XIV) Freud introduced the distinction in the unconscious between primary repression linked to the universal taboo on incest ('innately present originally') and repression ('after expulsion') that was a product of an individual's life history ('acquired in the course of the ego's development') in which something that was at one point conscious is rejected or eliminated from consciousness.

In his account of the development and modification of his theory of unconscious mental processes he sets out in his 1915 paper 'The Unconscious' (Standard Edition XIV), Freud identifies the three perspectives he employs: the dynamic, the economic and the topographical.

The dynamic perspective concerns firstly the constitution of the unconscious by repression and secondly the process of ""censorship"" which maintains unwanted, anxiety inducing thoughts as such. Here Freud is drawing on observations from his earliest clinical work in the treatment of hysteria.

In the economic perspective the focus is upon the trajectories of the repressed contents ""the vicissitudes of sexual impulses"" as they undergo complex transformations in the process of both symptom formation and normal unconscious thought such as dreams and slips of the tongue. These were topics Freud explored in detail in The Interpretation of Dreams and The Psychopathology of Everyday Life.

Whereas both these former perspectives focus on the unconscious as it is about to enter consciousness, the topographical perspective represents a shift in which the systemic properties of the unconscious, its characteristic processes and modes of operation such as condensation and displacement, are placed in the foreground.

This ""first topography"" presents a model of psychic structure comprising three systems:

The System Ucs - the unconscious: ""primary process"" mentation governed by the pleasure principle characterised by ""exemption from mutual contradiction,... mobility of cathexes, timelessness and replacement of external by psychical reality."" ('The Unconscious' (1915) Standard Edition XIV).
The System Pcs - the preconscious in which the unconscious thing-presentations of the primary process are bound by the secondary processes of language (word presentations), a prerequisite for their becoming available to consciousness.
The System Cns - conscious thought governed by the reality principle.

In his later work, notably in The Ego and the Id (1923), a second topography is introduced comprising id, ego and super-ego, which is superimposed on the first without replacing it. In this later formulation of the concept of the unconscious the id comprises a reservoir of instincts or drives a portion of them being hereditary or innate, a portion repressed or acquired. As such, from the economic perspective, the id is the prime source of psychical energy and from the dynamic perspective it conflicts with the ego and the super-ego which, genetically speaking, are diversifications of the id.

Dreams

Freud believed the function of dreams is to preserve sleep by representing as fulfilled wishes that would otherwise awaken the dreamer.

In Freud's theory dreams are instigated by the daily occurrences and thoughts of everyday life. In what Freud called the ""dream-work"", these ""secondary process"" thoughts (""word presentations""), governed by the rules of language and the reality principle, become subject to the ""primary process"" of unconscious thought (""thing presentations"") governed by the pleasure principle, wish gratification and the repressed sexual scenarios of childhood. Because of the disturbing nature of the latter and other repressed thoughts and desires which may have become linked to them, the dream-work operates a censorship function, disguising by distortion, displacement and condensation the repressed thoughts so as to preserve sleep.

In the clinical setting Freud encouraged free association to the dream's manifest content, as recounted in the dream narrative, so as to facilitate interpretative work on its latent content – the repressed thoughts and fantasies – and also on the underlying mechanisms and structures operative in the dream-work. As Freud developed his theoretical work on dreams he went beyond his theory of dreams as wish-fulfillments to arrive at an emphasis on dreams as ""nothing other than a particular form of thinking.... It is the dream-work that creates that form, and it alone is the essence of dreaming"".

Psychosexual development

Freud's theory of psychosexual development proposes that, following on from the initial polymorphous perversity of infantile sexuality, the sexual ""drives"" pass through the distinct developmental phases of the oral, the anal, and the phallic. Though these phases then give way to a latency stage of reduced sexual interest and activity (from the age of five to puberty, approximately), they leave, to a greater or lesser extent, a ""perverse"" and bisexual residue which persists during the formation of adult genital sexuality. Freud argued that neurosis or perversion could be explained in terms of fixation or regression to these phases whereas adult character and cultural creativity could achieve a sublimation of their perverse residue.

After Freud's later development of the theory of the Oedipus complex this normative developmental trajectory becomes formulated in terms of the child's renunciation of incestuous desires under the fantasised threat of (or phantasised fact of, in the case of the girl) castration. The ""dissolution"" of the Oedipus complex is then achieved when the child's rivalrous identification with the parental figure is transformed into the pacifying identifications of the Ego ideal which assume both similarity and difference and acknowledge the separateness and autonomy of the other.

Freud hoped to prove that his model was universally valid and turned to ancient mythology and contemporary ethnography for comparative material arguing that totemism reflected a ritualized enactment of a tribal Oedipal conflict.

Id, ego, and super-ego

Freud proposed that the human psyche could be divided into three parts: Id, ego and super-ego. Freud discussed this model in the 1920 essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle, and fully elaborated upon it in The Ego and the Id (1923), in which he developed it as an alternative to his previous topographic schema (i.e., conscious, unconscious and preconscious). The id is the completely unconscious, impulsive, childlike portion of the psyche that operates on the ""pleasure principle"" and is the source of basic impulses and drives; it seeks immediate pleasure and gratification.

Freud acknowledged that his use of the term Id (das Es, ""the It"") derives from the writings of Georg Groddeck. The super-ego is the moral component of the psyche, which takes into account no special circumstances in which the morally right thing may not be right for a given situation. The rational ego attempts to exact a balance between the impractical hedonism of the id and the equally impractical moralism of the super-ego; it is the part of the psyche that is usually reflected most directly in a person's actions. When overburdened or threatened by its tasks, it may employ defence mechanisms including denial, repression, undoing, rationalization, and displacement. This concept is usually represented by the ""Iceberg Model"". This model represents the roles the id, ego, and super- ego play in relation to conscious and unconscious thought.

Freud compared the relationship between the ego and the id to that between a charioteer and his horses: the horses provide the energy and drive, while the charioteer provides direction.

Life and death drives

Freud believed that the human psyche is subject to two conflicting drives: the life drive or libido and the death drive. The life drive was also termed ""Eros"" and the death drive ""Thanatos"", although Freud did not use the latter term; ""Thanatos"" was introduced in this context by Paul Federn. Freud hypothesized that libido is a form of mental energy with which processes, structures and object-representations are invested.

In Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920), Freud inferred the existence of a death drive. Its premise was a regulatory principle that has been described as ""the principle of psychic inertia"", ""the Nirvana principle"", and ""the conservatism of instinct"". Its background was Freud's earlier Project for a Scientific Psychology, where he had defined the principle governing the mental apparatus as its tendency to divest itself of quantity or to reduce tension to zero. Freud had been obliged to abandon that definition, since it proved adequate only to the most rudimentary kinds of mental functioning, and replaced the idea that the apparatus tends toward a level of zero tension with the idea that it tends toward a minimum level of tension.

Freud in effect readopted the original definition in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, this time applying it to a different principle. He asserted that on certain occasions the mind acts as though it could eliminate tension entirely, or in effect to reduce itself to a state of extinction; his key evidence for this was the existence of the compulsion to repeat. Examples of such repetition included the dream life of traumatic neurotics and children's play. In the phenomenon of repetition, Freud saw a psychic trend to work over earlier impressions, to master them and derive pleasure from them, a trend was prior to the pleasure principle but not opposed to it. In addition to that trend, there was also a principle at work that was opposed to, and thus ""beyond"" the pleasure principle. If repetition is a necessary element in the binding of energy or adaptation, when carried to inordinate lengths it becomes a means of abandoning adaptations and reinstating earlier or less evolved psychic positions. By combining this idea with the hypothesis that all repetition is a form of discharge, Freud reached the conclusion that the compulsion to repeat is an effort to restore a state that is both historically primitive and marked by the total draining of energy: death.

Melancholia

In his 1917 essay ""Mourning and Melancholia"", Freud drew a distinction between mourning, painful but an inevitable part of life, and ""melancholia"", his term for pathological refusal of a mourner to ""decathect"" from the lost one. Freud claimed that, in normal mourning, the ego was responsible for narcissistically detaching the libido from the lost one as a means of self-preservation, but that in ""melancholia"", prior ambivalence towards the lost one prevents this from occurring. Suicide, Freud hypothesized, could result in extreme cases, when unconscious feelings of conflict became directed against the mourner's own ego.

Femininity and female sexuality
Initiating what became the first debate within psychoanalysis on femininity, Karen Horney of the Berlin Institute set out to challenge Freud's account of the development of feminine sexuality. Rejecting Freud's theories of the feminine castration complex and penis envy, Horney argued for a primary femininity and penis envy as a defensive formation rather than arising from the fact, or ""injury"", of biological asymmetry as Freud held. Horney had the influential support of Melanie Klein and Ernest Jones who coined the term ""phallocentrism"" in his critique of Freud's position.

In defending Freud against this critique, feminist scholar Jacqueline Rose has argued that it presupposes a more normative account of female sexual development than that given by Freud. She notes that Freud moved from a description of the little girl stuck with her 'inferiority' or 'injury' in the face of the anatomy of the little boy to an account in his later work which explicitly describes the process of becoming 'feminine' as an 'injury' or 'catastrophe' for the complexity of her earlier psychic and sexual life.

According to Freud, ""Elimination of clitoral sexuality is a necessary precondition for the development of femininity, since it is immature and masculine in its nature."" Freud postulated the concept of ""vaginal orgasm"" as separate from clitoral orgasm, achieved by external stimulation of the clitoris. In 1905, he stated that clitoral orgasms are purely an adolescent phenomenon and that, upon reaching puberty, the proper response of mature women is a change-over to vaginal orgasms, meaning orgasms without any clitoral stimulation. This theory has been criticized on the grounds that Freud provided no evidence for this basic assumption, and because it made many women feel inadequate when they could not achieve orgasm via vaginal intercourse alone.

Religion

Freud regarded the monotheistic God as an illusion based upon the infantile emotional need for a powerful, supernatural pater familias. He maintained that religion – once necessary to restrain man's violent nature in the early stages of civilization – in modern times, can be set aside in favor of reason and science. ""Obsessive Actions and Religious Practices"" (1907) notes the likeness between faith (religious belief) and neurotic obsession. Totem and Taboo (1913) proposes that society and religion begin with the patricide and eating of the powerful paternal figure, who then becomes a revered collective memory. These arguments were further developed in The Future of an Illusion (1927) in which Freud argued that religious belief serves the function of psychological consolation. Freud argues the belief of a supernatural protector serves as a buffer from man's ""fear of nature"" just as the belief in an afterlife serves as a buffer from man's fear of death. The core idea of the work is that all of religious belief can be explained through its function to society, not for its relation to the truth. This is why, according to Freud, religious beliefs are ""illusions"". In Civilization and Its Discontents (1930), he quotes his friend Romain Rolland, who described religion as an ""oceanic sensation"", but says he never experienced this feeling. Moses and Monotheism (1937) proposes that Moses was the tribal pater familias, killed by the Jews, who psychologically coped with the patricide with a reaction formation conducive to their establishing monotheist Judaism; analogously, he described the Roman Catholic rite of Holy Communion as cultural evidence of the killing and devouring of the sacred father.

Moreover, he perceived religion, with its suppression of violence, as mediator of the societal and personal, the public and the private, conflicts between Eros and Thanatos, the forces of life and death. Later works indicate Freud's pessimism about the future of civilization, which he noted in the 1931 edition of Civilization and its Discontents.

In a footnote of his 1909 work, Analysis of a Phobia in a Five year old Boy, Freud theorized that the universal fear of castration was provoked in the uncircumcised when they perceived circumcision and that this was ""the deepest unconscious root of anti-Semitism"".

Legacy

Freud's legacy, though a highly contested area of controversy, was described by Stephen Frosh as ""one of the strongest influences on twentieth-century thought, its impact comparable only to that of Darwinism and Marxism."" Henri Ellenberger stated that its range of influence permeated ""all the fields of culture ... so far as to change our way of life and concept of man.""

Psychotherapy
Though not the first methodology in the practice of individual verbal psychotherapy, Freud's psychoanalytic system came to dominate the field from early in the twentieth century, forming the basis for many later variants. While these systems have adopted different theories and techniques, all have followed Freud by attempting to achieve psychic and behavioral change through having patients talk about their difficulties. Psychoanalysis is not as influential as it once was in Europe and the United States, though in some parts of the world, notably Latin America, its influence in the later 20th century expanded substantially. Psychoanalysis also remains influential within many contemporary schools of psychotherapy and has led to innovative therapeutic work in schools and with families and groups. There is a substantial body of research which demonstrates the efficacy of the clinical methods of psychoanalysis and of related psychodynamic therapies in treating a wide range of psychological disorders.

The neo-Freudians, a group including Alfred Adler, Otto Rank, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich Fromm, rejected Freud's theory of instinctual drive, emphasized interpersonal relations and self-assertiveness, and made modifications to therapeutic practice that reflected these theoretical shifts. Adler originated the approach, although his influence was indirect due to his inability to systematically formulate his ideas. Neo-Freudian analysis places more emphasis on the patient's relationship with the analyst and less on exploration of the unconscious.

Carl Jung believed that the collective unconscious, which reflects the cosmic order and the history of the human species, is the most important part of the mind. It contains archetypes, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the anima (a man's suppressed female self), the animus (a woman's suppressed male self), or the shadow (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.

Jacques Lacan approached psychoanalysis through linguistics and literature. Lacan believed Freud's essential work had been done prior to 1905 and concerned the interpretation of dreams, neurotic symptoms, and slips, which had been based on a revolutionary way of understanding language and its relation to experience and subjectivity, and that ego psychology and object relations theory were based upon misreadings of Freud's work. For Lacan, the determinative dimension of human experience is neither the self (as in ego psychology) nor relations with others (as in object relations theory), but language. Lacan saw desire as more important than need and considered it necessarily ungratifiable.

Wilhelm Reich developed ideas that Freud had developed at the beginning of his psychoanalytic investigation but then superseded but never finally discarded. These were the concept of the Actualneurosis and a theory of anxiety based upon the idea of dammed-up libido. In Freud's original view, what really happened to a person (the ""actual"") determined the resulting neurotic disposition. Freud applied that idea both to infants and to adults. In the former case, seductions were sought as the causes of later neuroses and in the latter incomplete sexual release. Unlike Freud, Reich retained the idea that actual experience, especially sexual experience, was of key significance. By the 1920s, Reich had ""taken Freud's original ideas about sexual release to the point of specifying the orgasm as the criteria of healthy function."" Reich was also ""developing his ideas about character into a form that would later take shape, first as ""muscular armour"", and eventually as a transducer of universal biological energy, the ""orgone"".""

Fritz Perls, who helped to develop Gestalt therapy, was influenced by Reich, Jung and Freud. The key idea of gestalt therapy is that Freud overlooked the structure of awareness, ""an active process that moves toward the construction of organized meaningful wholes... between an organism and its environment."" These wholes, called gestalts, are ""patterns involving all the layers of organismic function – thought, feeling, and activity."" Neurosis is seen as splitting in the formation of gestalts, and anxiety as the organism sensing ""the struggle towards its creative unification."" Gestalt therapy attempts to cure patients through placing them in contact with ""immediate organismic needs."" Perls rejected the verbal approach of classical psychoanalysis; talking in gestalt therapy serves the purpose of self-expression rather than gaining self-knowledge. Gestalt therapy usually takes place in groups, and in concentrated ""workshops"" rather than being spread out over a long period of time; it has been extended into new forms of communal living.

Arthur Janov's primal therapy, which has been an influential post-Freudian psychotherapy, resembles psychoanalytic therapy in its emphasis on early childhood experience, but has also differences with it. While Janov's theory is akin to Freud's early idea of Actualneurosis, he does not have a dynamic psychology but a nature psychology like that of Reich or Perls, in which need is primary while wish is derivative and dispensable when need is met. Despite its surface similarity to Freud's ideas, Janov's theory lacks a strictly psychological account of the unconscious and belief in infantile sexuality. While for Freud there was a hierarchy of danger situations, for Janov the key event in the child's life is awareness that the parents do not love it. Janov writes in The Primal Scream (1970) that primal therapy has in some ways returned to Freud's early ideas and techniques.

Ellen Bass and Laura Davis, co-authors of The Courage to Heal (1988), are described as ""champions of survivorship"" by Frederick Crews, who considers Freud the key influence upon them, although in his view they are indebted not to classic psychoanalysis but to ""the pre-psychoanalytic Freud... who supposedly took pity on his hysterical patients, found that they were all harboring memories of early abuse... and cured them by unknotting their repression."" Crews sees Freud as having anticipated the recovered memory movement by emphasizing ""mechanical cause-and-effect relations between symptomatology and the premature stimulation of one body zone or another"", and with pioneering its ""technique of thematically matching a patient's symptom with a sexually symmetrical 'memory.'"" Crews believes that Freud's confidence in accurate recall of early memories anticipates the theories of recovered memory therapists such as Lenore Terr, which in his view have led to people being wrongfully imprisoned or involved in litigation.

Science
Research projects designed to test Freud's theories empirically have led to a vast literature on the topic. American psychologists began to attempt to study repression in the experimental laboratory around 1930. In 1934, when the psychologist Saul Rosenzweig sent Freud reprints of his attempts to study repression, Freud responded with a dismissive letter stating that ""the wealth of reliable observations"" on which psychoanalytic assertions were based made them ""independent of experimental verification."" Seymour Fisher and Roger P. Greenberg concluded in 1977 that some of Freud's concepts were supported by empirical evidence. Their analysis of research literature supported Freud's concepts of oral and anal personality constellations, his account of the role of Oedipal factors in certain aspects of male personality functioning, his formulations about the relatively greater concern about loss of love in women's as compared to men's personality economy, and his views about the instigating effects of homosexual anxieties on the formation of paranoid delusions. They also found limited and equivocal support for Freud's theories about the development of homosexuality. They found that several of Freud's other theories, including his portrayal of dreams as primarily containers of secret, unconscious wishes, as well as some of his views about the psychodynamics of women, were either not supported or contradicted by research. Reviewing the issues again in 1996, they concluded that much experimental data relevant to Freud's work exists, and supports some of his major ideas and theories.

Other viewpoints include those of Hans Eysenck, who writes in Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (1985) that Freud set back the study of psychology and psychiatry ""by something like fifty years or more"", and Malcolm Macmillan, who concludes in Freud Evaluated (1991) that ""Freud's method is not capable of yielding objective data about mental processes"". Morris Eagle states that it has been ""demonstrated quite conclusively that because of the epistemologically contaminated status of clinical data derived from the clinical situation, such data have questionable probative value in the testing of psychoanalytic hypotheses"". Richard Webster, in Why Freud Was Wrong (1995), described psychoanalysis as perhaps the most complex and successful pseudoscience in history. Crews believes that psychoanalysis has no scientific or therapeutic merit.

I.B. Cohen regards Freud's Interpretation of Dreams as a revolutionary work of science, the last such work to be published in book form.
In contrast Allan Hobson believes that Freud, by rhetorically discrediting 19th century investigators of dreams such as Alfred Maury and the Marquis de Hervey de Saint-Denis at a time when study of the physiology of the brain was only beginning, interrupted the development of scientific dream theory for half a century. The dream researcher G. William Domhoff has disputed claims of Freudian dream theory being validated.

The philosopher Karl Popper, who argued that all proper scientific theories must be potentially falsifiable, claimed that Freud's psychoanalytic theories were presented in unfalsifiable form, meaning that no experiment could ever disprove them. The philosopher Adolf Grünbaum argues in The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984) that Popper was mistaken and that many of Freud's theories are empirically testable, a position with which others such as Eysenck agree. The philosopher Roger Scruton, writing in Sexual Desire (1986), also rejected Popper's arguments, pointing to the theory of repression as an example of a Freudian theory that does have testable consequences. Scruton nevertheless concluded that psychoanalysis is not genuinely scientific, on the grounds that it involves an unacceptable dependence on metaphor. The philosopher Donald Levy agrees with Grünbaum that Freud's theories are falsifiable but disputes Grünbaum's contention that therapeutic success is only the empirical basis on which they stand or fall, arguing that a much wider range of empirical evidence can be adduced if clinical case material is taken into consideration.

In a study of psychoanalysis in the United States, Nathan Hale reported on the ""decline of psychoanalysis in psychiatry"" during the years 1965–1985. The continuation of this trend was noted by Alan Stone: ""As academic psychology becomes more 'scientific' and psychiatry more biological, psychoanalysis is being brushed aside."" Paul Stepansky, while noting that psychoanalysis remains influential in the humanities, records the ""vanishingly small number of psychiatric residents who choose to pursue psychoanalytic training"" and the ""nonanalytic backgrounds of psychiatric chairpersons at major universities"" among the evidence he cites for his conclusion that ""Such historical trends attest to the marginalisation of psychoanalysis within American psychiatry."" Nonetheless Freud was ranked as the third most cited psychologist of the 20th century, according to a Review of General Psychology survey of American psychologists and psychology texts, published in 2002. It is also claimed that in moving beyond the ""orthodoxy of the not so distant past... new ideas and new research has led to an intense reawakening of interest in psychoanalysis from neighbouring disciplines ranging from the humanities to neuroscience and including the non-analytic therapies"".

Research in the emerging field of neuropsychoanalysis, founded by neuroscientist and psychoanalyst Mark Solms, has proved controversial with some psychoanalysts criticising the very concept itself. Solms and his colleagues have argued for neuro-scientific findings being ""broadly consistent"" with Freudian theories pointing out brain structures relating to Freudian concepts such as libido, drives, the unconscious, and repression. Neuroscientists who have endorsed Freud's work include David Eagleman who believes that Freud ""transformed psychiatry"" by providing "" the first exploration of the way in which hidden states of the brain participate in driving thought and behavior"" and Nobel laureate Eric Kandel who argues that ""psychoanalysis still represents the most coherent and intellectually satisfying view of the mind.""

Philosophy

Psychoanalysis has been interpreted as both radical and conservative. By the 1940s, it had come to be seen as conservative by the European and American intellectual community. Critics outside the psychoanalytic movement, whether on the political left or right, saw Freud as a conservative. Fromm had argued that several aspects of psychoanalytic theory served the interests of political reaction in his The Fear of Freedom (1942), an assessment confirmed by sympathetic writers on the right. In Freud: The Mind of the Moralist (1959), Philip Rieff portrayed Freud as a man who urged men to make the best of an inevitably unhappy fate, and admirable for that reason. In the 1950s, Herbert Marcuse challenged the then prevailing interpretation of Freud as a conservative in Eros and Civilization (1955), as did Lionel Trilling in Freud and the Crisis of Our Culture and Norman O. Brown in Life Against Death (1959). Eros and Civilization helped make the idea that Freud and Karl Marx were addressing similar questions from different perspectives credible to the left. Marcuse criticized neo-Freudian revisionism for discarding seemingly pessimistic theories such as the death instinct, arguing that they could be turned in a utopian direction. Freud's theories also influenced the Frankfurt School and critical theory as a whole.

Freud has been compared to Marx by Reich, who saw Freud's importance for psychiatry as parallel to that of Marx for economics, and by Paul Robinson, who sees Freud as a revolutionary whose contributions to twentieth century thought are comparable in importance to Marx's contributions to nineteenth century thought. Fromm calls Freud, Marx, and Einstein the ""architects of the modern age"", but rejects the idea that Marx and Freud were equally significant, arguing that Marx was both far more historically important and a finer thinker. Fromm nevertheless credits Freud with permanently changing the way human nature is understood. Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari write in Anti-Oedipus (1972) that psychoanalysis resembles the Russian Revolution in that it became corrupted almost from the beginning. They believe this began with Freud's development of the theory of the Oedipus complex, which they see as idealist.

Jean-Paul Sartre critiques Freud's theory of the unconscious in Being and Nothingness (1943), claiming that consciousness is essentially self-conscious. Sartre also attempts to adapt some of Freud's ideas to his own account of human life, and thereby develop an ""existential psychoanalysis"" in which causal categories are replaced by teleological categories. Maurice Merleau-Ponty considers Freud to be one of the anticipators of phenomenology, while Theodor W. Adorno considers Edmund Husserl, the founder of phenomenology, to be Freud's philosophical opposite, writing that Husserl's polemic against psychologism could have been directed against psychoanalysis. Paul Ricœur sees Freud as one of the three ""masters of suspicion"", alongside Marx and Nietzsche, for their unmasking 'the lies and illusions of consciousness'. Ricœur and Jürgen Habermas have helped create a ""hermeneutic version of Freud"", one which ""claimed him as the most significant progenitor of the shift from an objectifying, empiricist understanding of the human realm to one stressing subjectivity and interpretation."" Louis Althusser drew on Freud's concept of overdetermination for his reinterpretation of Marx's Capital. Jean-François Lyotard developed a theory of the unconscious that reverses Freud's account of the dream-work: for Lyotard, the unconscious is a force whose intensity is manifest via disfiguration rather than condensation. Jacques Derrida finds Freud to be both a late figure in the history of western metaphysics and, with Nietzsche and Heidegger, a precursor of his own brand of radicalism.

Several scholars see Freud as parallel to Plato, writing that they hold nearly the same theory of dreams and have similar theories of the tripartite structure of the human soul or personality, even if the hierarchy between the parts of the soul is almost reversed. Ernest Gellner argues that Freud's theories are an inversion of Plato's. Whereas Plato saw a hierarchy inherent in the nature of reality, and relied upon it to validate norms, Freud was a naturalist who could not follow such an approach. Both men's theories drew a parallel between the structure of the human mind and that of society, but while Plato wanted to strengthen the super-ego, which corresponded to the aristocracy, Freud wanted to strengthen the ego, which corresponded to the middle class. Paul Vitz compares Freudian psychoanalysis to Thomism, noting St. Thomas's belief in the existence of an ""unconscious consciousness"" and his ""frequent use of the word and concept 'libido' – sometimes in a more specific sense than Freud, but always in a manner in agreement with the Freudian use."" Vitz suggests that Freud may have been unaware his theory of the unconscious was reminiscent of Aquinas.

Literature and literary criticism
The poem ""In Memory of Sigmund Freud"" was published by British poet W. H. Auden in his 1940 collection Another Time. Auden describes Freud as having created ""a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives.""

Literary critic Harold Bloom has been influenced by Freud. Camille Paglia has also been influenced by Freud, whom she calls ""Nietzsche's heir"" and one of the greatest sexual psychologists in literature, but has rejected the scientific status of his work in her Sexual Personae (1990), writing, ""Freud has no rivals among his successors because they think he wrote science, when in fact he wrote art.""

Feminism

The decline in Freud's reputation has been attributed partly to the revival of feminism. Simone de Beauvoir criticizes psychoanalysis from an existentialist standpoint in The Second Sex (1949), arguing that Freud saw an ""original superiority"" in the male that is in reality socially induced. Betty Friedan criticizes Freud and what she considered his Victorian view of women in The Feminine Mystique (1963). Freud's concept of penis envy was attacked by Kate Millett, who in Sexual Politics (1970) accused him of confusion and oversights. Naomi Weisstein writes that Freud and his followers erroneously thought his ""years of intensive clinical experience"" added up to scientific rigor.

Freud is also criticized by Shulamith Firestone and Eva Figes. In The Dialectic of Sex (1970), Firestone argues that Freud was a ""poet"" who produced metaphors rather than literal truths; in her view, Freud, like feminists, recognized that sexuality was the crucial problem of modern life, but ignored the social context and failed to question society itself. Firestone interprets Freud's ""metaphors"" in terms of the facts of power within the family. Figes tries in Patriarchal Attitudes (1970) to place Freud within a ""history of ideas"". Juliet Mitchell defends Freud against his feminist critics in Psychoanalysis and Feminism (1974), accusing them of misreading him and misunderstanding the implications of psychoanalytic theory for feminism. Mitchell helped introduce English-speaking feminists to Lacan. Mitchell is criticized by Jane Gallop in The Daughter's Seduction (1982). Gallop compliments Mitchell for her criticism of feminist discussions of Freud, but finds her treatment of Lacanian theory lacking.

Some French feminists, among them Julia Kristeva and Luce Irigaray, have been influenced by Freud as interpreted by Lacan. Irigaray has produced a theoretical challenge to Freud and Lacan, using their theories against them to put forward a ""psychoanalytic explanation for theoretical bias"". Irigaray, who claims that ""the cultural unconscious only recognizes the male sex"", describes how this affects ""accounts of the psychology of women"".

Psychologist Carol Gilligan writes that ""The penchant of developmental theorists to project a masculine image, and one that appears frightening to women, goes back at least to Freud."" She sees Freud's criticism of women's sense of justice reappearing in the work of Jean Piaget and Lawrence Kohlberg. Gilligan notes that Nancy Chodorow, in contrast to Freud, attributes sexual difference not to anatomy but to the fact that male and female children have different early social environments. Chodorow, writing against the masculine bias of psychoanalysis, ""replaces Freud's negative and derivative description of female psychology with a positive and direct account of her own.""

Toril Moi has developed a feminist perspective on psychoanalysis proposing that it is a discourse that ""attempts to understand the psychic consequences of three universal traumas: the fact that there are others, the fact of sexual difference, and the fact of death"". She replaces Freud's term of castration with Stanley Cavell's concept of ""victimization"" which is a more universal term that applies equally to both sexes. Moi regards this concept of human finitude as a suitable replacement for both castration and sexual difference as the traumatic ""discovery of our separate, sexed, mortal existence"" and how both men and women come to terms with it.

"An American Moment

An American Moment was a syndicated short-form television series, created by Dr. Prentice Meador, James R. Kirk and Neal Spelce, initially hosted by newsman Charles Kuralt and later by actor James Earl Jones.

The show consisted of 90-second vignettes, generally intended for use as inserts during local news programs, and focused on ""small town America"" and overlooked news stories. It was produced by an Austin, Texas based production company headed by Spelce, a longtime local newsman, based on an earlier similar program called Breakthrough that featured Prentice Meador, a Dallas minister and professor.  
It was carried by more than 70 stations throughout the United States.  Kuralt, the series's first host, came out of retirement to take on the series.  Kuralt described the program's content as ""New England stone walls, cowboy hats, the birth of a foal on a ranch, totem poles and barber poles.""

Kuralt died in 1997. He was replaced by James Earl Jones, who continued as host of the program until production ended in 1999.  Charles Kuralt's American Moments , a compilation of vignettes from the series, was published by Simon & Schuster in 1998.  Kirkus Reviews described the book as ""[j]ust as hokey and sentimental as Kuralt’s broadcasts.""  

The Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin holds an archive of materials relating to the series.

"Mayrtup

Mayrtup (, ) is a village (selo) in Kurchaloyevsky District, Chechnya.

Administrative and municipal status 
Municipally, Mayrtup is incorporated as Mayrtupskoye rural settlement. It is the administrative center of the municipality and the only settlement included in it.

Geography 

Mayrtup is located on the left bank of the Gums River, at the confluence of the Isnerk River. It is on the outskirts of the town of Kurchaloy and is  south-east of the city of Grozny.

The nearest settlements to Mayrtup are Ilaskhan-Yurt in the north-west, Bachi-Yurt in the north-east, Dzhigurty in the south-east, Khidi-Khutor in the south, and the town of Kurchaloy in the west.

History 
Between 1818 and 1826, Mayrtup was the center of an uprising led by a resident of the village, named Beybulat Taimiev. The village also became a social and political center where the national council, ""Mekhk-Khel"" occurred.

On May 24, 1821, an announcement took place at the national convention in the mosque of Mayrtup. At that time, the mosque was a spiritual center of Chechnya.

On May 25, 1825, the All-Chechen congress gathered in the village. An election was made at the congress by the Imam of Chechnya of Magoma Kuduklinsky.

In 1834, at the next All-Chechen congress in the village of Mayrtup, Tashav-Khadzhi was elected as the leader of Chechnya, as an imam.

The village suffered greatly in the Caucasian War and was often ravaged by Russian invaders. One notable incident occurred in November of 1840, when the villages of Mayrtup and Aki-Yurt were heavily raided. After the war ended, the farms around Mayrtup were liquidated and their populations were resettled to Mayrtup, under Tsarist policies.

In 1877, during the ""Alibek-Haji Uprising"", the first major battle of the uprising occurred near the northern outskirts of Mayrtup. As a result, the village was partially destroyed.

In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Mayrtup was renamed to Sulebkent, and settled by people from the neighbouring republic of Dagestan, particularly, by ethnic Dargins.

In 1957, when the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old Chechen name, Mayrtup.

Population 
 2002 Census: 10,754
 2010 Census: 11,838
 2018 estimate: 13,395

According to the 2010 Census, the majority of residents of Mayrtup (11,777) were ethnic Chechens, with 61 people from other ethnic backgrounds.

"The Big Hurt (song)

""The Big Hurt"" is a pop song that was a hit for Toni Fisher (billed as ""Miss Toni Fisher"") in 1959.  The song was written by Wayne Shanklin. The song went to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart in the United States. ""The Big Hurt"" is notable because it featured phasing effects which at that time were rare in popular music; DJ Dick Biondi on WKBW would introduce the record as ""Toni Fisher's weird one.""

Music
The 45 rpm plays in C major, even though on the sheet music (copyright 1959 by Music Productions, Hollywood, CA), the song is in the key of F major.  The time signature is 4/4, and the tempo is indicated as ""Moderate Beguine Tempo."" The melody begins with a triplet on beats three and four, a motif that appears throughout the song in every second measure. In the other measures, however, the duple meter is reinforced by using eighth notes in the same location, presumably to prevent the tune from becoming a waltz. Although Miss Toni Fisher does use the triplet in her performance on the record, she takes liberties with it and often uses some form of duple rhythm. She also deviates here and there from the notes as written, but well within the usual range employed by singers for expressive purposes.

The main harmonic idea uses the tonic chord alternating with the Neapolitan chord (the flattened supertonic major chord). (The sheet music has an error that occurs three times, but in the chord symbols only, not in actual piano notation: the A flat diminished chord should really be the E major chord with a G# bass note.) The release (contrasting middle section) is in the key of A flat.

Effects
American music industry veterans David S. Gold and Stan Ross, founders of the renowned Gold Star Studios in Hollywood, claim that ""The Big Hurt"" was the first commercial recording to feature a technique (or effect) now known as flanging. This ""jet plane-like"" sound effect may also be familiar to those who have listened to long-distance shortwave radio music broadcasts.  (In radio, this effect was the result of multipath interference and varying propagation times.)  To some, the flanging effect made this record sound like a distant shortwave broadcast.

Covers
The song was covered numerous times in the mid-to-late-1960s, by artists as diverse as jazz musician Bobby Hutcherson, Scott Walker and Del Shannon.
 Del Shannon's 1966 version reached No. 94 on the Hot 100 (his only charted single on Liberty Records). Shannon's version, produced by Snuff Garrett, also included the phasing effects.
In 1984, the San Francisco-based, dance group, Bearesssense had a minor club hit with their version.

Ocypode brevicornis is a species of ghost crab native to the Indian Ocean, from the Gulf of Oman to the Nicobar Islands. They are relatively large ghost crabs with a somewhat trapezoidal body. The carapace reaches a length of  and a width of . They are a mottled brown to yellow in coloration. Like other ghost crabs, one of their claws is much larger than the other. Their eyestalks are large and elongated, tipped with prolongations at the tip known as styles. They are common inhabitants of open sandy beaches, living in burrows in the intertidal zone.

Taxonomy
Ocypode brevicornis was first described by the French zoologist Henri Milne-Edwards in 1837. However, his type specimens consisted only of two juvenile individuals from Pondicherry, India. In 1852, he again described the same species from adult specimens recovered from the same area as Ocypode platytarsis. In 1880, the American zoologist John Sterling Kingsley synonymized Ocypode brevicornis with Ocypode ceratophthalma. As a result, only Ocypode platytarsis was regarded as valid for the entirety of the 20th century. And most literature concerning the species refer to it as Ocypode platytarsis. In 2013, the Japanese carcinologist Katsushi Sakai and German carcinologist Michael Türkay discovered that the type specimens of Ocypode brevicornis and Ocypode platytarsis belonged to the same species. They restored the validity of the earlier name Ocypode brevicornis.

Ocypode brevicornis has also been frequently confused with Ocypode ceratophthalma, due to the fact that both species possess elongations of their eyestalks (styles). The variety Ocypode brevicornis var. longicornuta described by the American zoologist James Dwight Dana is now known to be a synonym of Ocypode ceratophthalma.

Ocypode brevicornis belongs to the genus Ocypode of the ghost crab subfamily Ocypodinae in the family Ocypodidae.

Description
Ocypode brevicornis are large ghost crabs with deep bodies. The carapace in adults ranges from  in length, and  in width. It is almost trapezoidal in shape, with the rear end distinctly narrower than the front. It is wider than it is long and covered with scattered rough bumps (tubercles). The upper margins of the eye sockets slant forwards on the inner half and backwards for the outer half. The edges of the eye sockets are rectangular.

The eyestalks are large and swollen with the cornea occupying most of the bottom half. The eyestalks exhibit prolongations (styles) on the tips like some other members of the genus. The styles may be absent or much shorter in juvenile specimens, as it only starts growing when the crab is around  in length.

Like other ghost crabs, one of the claw appendages (chelipeds, the first pereiopod pair) of Ocypode brevicornis is much bigger than the other. The palm of the larger cheliped is long with a rough bumpy texture on the upper surface. The upper edges of the palm are covered with small bumps while the bottom edge is serrated. The inner surface of the palm of the larger claw in both sexes features stridulating (sound-producing) ridges, which is important for identifying different species within the subfamily Ocypodinae. In Ocypode brevicornis, the stridulating ridge is composed of a row of 23 to 28 tubercles. The smaller cheliped tapers towards a pointed end.

The first gonopod (appendages modified into sexual organs) of the male is stem-like. Its cross-section has three sides on the base ending in a slightly curving tip. A broad and flat palp is present. The covering (operculum) of the female genital opening is oriented lengthwise with a thick straight rim slanting backwards.

Adult Ocypode brevicornis are a mottled yellow to brown in coloration. Males have been observed to display brighter yellow colors, especially on their legs. Juveniles have almost perfect cryptic camouflage, making it very difficult to pick them out from their surroundings.

Ecology

Like other ghost crabs, Ocypode brevicornis live in deep burrows near the intertidal zone of open sandy beaches. They are generalists, scavenging carrion and debris as well as preying on small animals.

They are primarily nocturnal, though they may emerge during the day. They are swift runners, darting away to their burrows at the slightest sign of danger, even when the intruder sighted is still  away. However, they can be approached much more closely at night, though they may still try to escape if illuminated.

Males of Ocypode brevicornis exhibit elaborate territorial displays. Like other ghost crabs, they produce sound and vibration by rapping their larger claws against the ground. They may also display ""dances"" on the approach of another ghost crab. Beginning with a rearing posture, the males conduct increasingly complex sideways movements ending by running around the intruder in circles until it retreats.

Distribution
Ocypode brevicornis are restricted to the Indian Ocean. They can be found from the Gulf of Oman to India, Sri Lanka, and the Nicobar Islands. They are one of six ghost crab species found in the Indian subcontinent, the others being Ocypode ceratophthalma, Ocypode cordimanus, Ocypode macrocera, Ocypode pallidula, and Ocypode rotundata.

}}Eucithara  is a genus of small to quite large sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Mangeliidae.

This genus has been a convenient dumping ground for many Indo-Pacific species. A profound study is still lacking and polyphyly probably occurs, as shown by the radulae of the few species examined.

Description
Species in this genus show a rather solid turreted-fusiform shell, sculptured by bold longitudinal ribs, over-run by dense spiral threads, and decussated by an even finer radial striatum. The aperture is as long, or longer, than the spire, fortified externally by a stout varix which ascends the previous whorl, includes a semi-circular sinus, and extends a free edge over the mouth. Within the outer lip are a series of short entering ridges, and the columella bears a corresponding series of deeply entering horizontal bars.

Distribution
This genus has a wide distribution in the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the East China Sea; off Australia (Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia).

"Minnesota State Highway 64

Minnesota State Highway 64 (MN 64) is a  highway in north-central Minnesota, which runs from its         
intersection with State Highway 210 in Motley and continues north to its northern terminus at its intersection with State Highway 200 near Laporte and Kabekona.

Determined as an important alternate route to congestion-plagued Highway 371, this road has been designated a Minnesota Regional Corridor along its entire length.

Route description
State Highway 64 serves as a north–south route in north-central Minnesota between Motley, Akeley, and Hendrickson Township.

Highway 64 passes through the following forests:

Foot Hills State Forest in Cass County
Badoura State Forest in southeast Hubbard County 
Paul Bunyan State Forest in Hubbard County

This route is often used by motorists as a shortcut between Bemidji and the Twin Cities to avoid congestion on nearby Highway 371.  Highway 64 parallels Highway 371.

U.S. Highway 10 is four blocks from the southern terminus of Highway 64 in Motley at State Highway 210.

History
Highway 64 was authorized between Motley and Akeley in 1933. The part of the route from Akeley to State Highway 200 was authorized in 1949, but not constructed until the mid-1960s.

Highway 64 was still a primitive road in 1940. The original section was completely paved by the late 1950s. The section of the route between Akeley and Highway 200 was built as a new road by 1965.

Highway 64 was reconstructed in 1998 between its junctions with State Highway 87. A sharp 90 degree turn along this stretch was smoothed out, and the road widened through a swampy area that had steep dropoffs on either side leading to water-filled ditches.

"Nippon (song)

""Nippon"" is a song by Japanese musician Ringo Sheena. It was released as a single on June 11, 2014, two weeks after her self-cover album Gyakuyunyū: Kōwankyoku and a year after her previous solo single ""Irohanihoheto"" / ""Kodoku no Akatsuki"". The song is being used as the 2014 soccer theme song for NHK.

Background and development 

In 2013 and 2014, Sheena had celebrated her 15th anniversary since her debut single ""Kōfukuron"". She began with the single ""Irohanihoheto/Kodoku no Akatsuki"" in May, following this up in November with two compilation albums, Ukina and Mitsugetsu-shō, and a series of lives entitled . She finished the anniversary year on the day with an album called Gyakuyunyū: Kōwankyoku, which featured new versions of songs she had given to other musicians.

In previous years, NHK had selected Superfly's ""Tamashii Revolution"" (2010), Radwimps' ""Kimi to Hitsuji to Ao"" (2011–2012) and Sakanaction's ""Aoi"" (2013–2014) as their soccer broadcast theme song. ""Tamashii Revolution"" in particular was commercially successful, being certified gold twice by the RIAJ for digital downloads.

Writing and production 

The song was written for NHK after they requested a song by Sheena for their soccer broadcasts. NHK asked Sheena to create the song in March, and she quickly produced it at the start of April. NHK requested a song that expressed the samurai and nadeshiko spirit of Japan that could also be used for broadcasts featuring other teams, and asked if the song could feature ""blue"" in the lyrics (i.e. the colour of the Japan national football team) Sheena wanted to use the Tokyo Jihen song ""Gunjō Biyori"" due to its mention of blue and its well-fitting tempo and chords, however created a new song after considering's specific requests for the song they desired. The song was inspired by her time living in Shimizu, Shizuoka, which she considers the ""soccer kingdom"" of Japan. It was also inspired by everything she experienced with her band Tokyo Jihen, such as their 2010 sports-themed album Sports and the song ""Atarashii Bunmeimaika"" (2011).  Sheena felt a lot of pressure, as she does not consider herself seen as a sporty musician.

The B-side ""Sakasa ni Kazoete"" was also given the Spanish language title ""Cuenta atrás"" (""count back""), her second song title in Spanish after  ""Paisaje"" on Gyakuyunyū: Kōwankyoku. Contrasting ""Nippon"", a song about special occasions, Sheena wrote the song dealing with everyday things.

The song featured three guitarists: Sheena, Shinichi Ubukata of the bands Ellegarden and Nothing's Carved in Stone, and studio musician Yukio Nagoshi, who had collaborated in 2009 with Sheena on her song ""Yokyō"". Additional members included Hitoshi Watanabe of the 1980s band Shi-Shonen on bass, Muzai Moratorium drummer Noriyasu Kawamura and programming by Nobuhiko Nakayama. Great Eida Strings performed an orchestral backing, led by conductor Neko Saito. Several of these musicians had collaborated with Sheena on Gyakuyunyū: Kōwankyoku: Ubukata and Kawamura had performed together on ""Amagasa"", while Nagoshi has performed on ""Cappuccino"". Nakayama had produced the song ""Ketteiteki Sanpunkan"", while Great Eida Strings had performed ""Bōenkyō no Soto no Keshiki"".

Promotion and release 

NHK timed the switch over of theme songs from Sakanaction's ""Aoi"" to ""Nippon"" to coincide with the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Sheena performed ""Nippon"" on NHK on June 8, first airing on the NHK BS premium program Soccer World Cup Kōfun wa Oto to Tomo ni and the clip again on Music Japan. It featured 300 people performing the song, including Sheena, a traditional rock band, a string orchestra and a cheer-squad. The song was performed again at CDTV on June 14, and at Music Station on June 20, in a special 2014 FIFA World Cup-themed broadcast, including News' ""One (For the Win)"" and Naoto Inti Raymi's ""The World Is Ours!"". Sheena performed the song at the 65th Kōhaku Uta Gassen on December 31, 2014, therein titled ""NIPPON -Kōhaku Borderless Edit-"", again featuring a cheer squad.

Sheena appeared on Seiji Kameda's radio corner Behind the Melody: FM Kameda on the J-Wave radio program Beat Corner, on June 9, 10, 11 and 12, making it the first time the pair have worked together publicly since the break-up of Tokyo Jihen in 2012.

For the release of Gyakuyunyū: Kōwankyoku, Sheena performed a four date tour called . She performed ""Sakasa ni Kazoete"" at these lives as one of the encore songs.

On June 10, 2014, a music video was released for the song. The Yuichi Kodama-directed music video featured scenes of Sheena and her bandmates performing the song in greyscale, in a studio.

The B-side ""Sakasa ni Kazoete"" was successful enough to chart at number 91 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100.

Critical reception 

Tomoko Imai from Rockin' On Japan praised the song, calling it ""reassuringly catchy rock"" with ""vuvuzela-like sounds on top of a Ramones-like tough beat"". She praised the addition of Ubukata and Nagoshi on guitars, and felt like the song was perfect for a soccer anthem. CDJournal reviewers described the song as ""straight pitch rock 'n' roll overflowing with feelings of speed"". They noted the song's overlaying of Sheena, the ""elegant"" large scale strings section and the ""raging"" band sound.

Internet commentators felt that the song came across as overly nationalist and right-wing, especially after an incident in March where banners reading ""Japanese Only"" had been placed at a game between the Urawa Red Diamonds and Sagan Tosu. Asahi Shimbun commented that the lyric  made the Japanese national soccer team colour equivalent to blood purity.

Music critic Takayuki Ishiguro felt the Japan-based lyrics were a high risk for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, given that it was predicted that Japan would be knocked out early, and that it was an inappropriate song to play during matches that did not involve Japan. Journalist Yoshiaki Sei felt that the song was a misunderstanding of what soccer culture was, as he considered soccer a ""symbol of mixing peoples and cultures"". Music critic Akimasa Munetaka argued that the song was not political, noting that Sheena was a musician who had incorporated traditional Japanese aspects since her debut. Munetaka felt that the song was just an exaggeration of these aspects.

"Back to Love (Jolina Magdangal album)

Back to Love is the eighth studio album by Filipino singer-actress Jolina Magdangal originally released by Star Music on November 20, 2015 through digital downloading and streaming containing seven original songs. An expanded edition was released on February 2016, this time both on digital and physical forms. The album serves as Magdangal's comeback album after a seven-year hiatus in the recording industry, as well as a homecoming in Star Music.

Two weeks after its release, it was certified with Gold from the Philippine Association of the Record Industry.

In the 8th PMPC Star Awards for Music, Magdangal won Best Female Recording Artist of the Year and Back To Love was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Album Cover.

Critical response
Back to Love received positive reviews from music critics with Rito P. Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer generally praising the selections and Magdangal's delivery as ""love songs that are as emotively arranged as they are lovingly rendered"". In particular, Asilo lauds Magdangal's technical singing in the album's carrier single ""Ikaw Ba 'Yon"" saying ""[it] is a love-on-the-rocks ditty that allows [Magdangal] to display her gorgeous notes as she scales the tune’s ascending melody. But, the songstress’ triumph goes beyond technical singing in this particular track, she effectively delineates contrasting emotions that require her to shuttle between 'holding on' and 'letting go'. While in ""Kaya Mo Pa Ba"", Asilo praised Magdangal's straightforward singing.

Commercial performance
Back to Love received a gold record certification from the Philippine Association of the Record Industry two weeks after its release in physical form.

"Ham Home-cum-Hamgreen Woods

Ham Home-cum-Hamgreen Woods is a 23.2 hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest in KIngswood near Grendon Underwood in Buckinghamshire. It is composed of two separate areas, Ham Home Wood and Hamgreen Wood, and is a small part of the formerly extensive Bernwood Forest.

The site is woodland on clay, and although most of it has been coppiced at different times, it has a varied structure, and rich variety of flora and invertebrates. These factors, together with the presence of wild service trees, show that the woods are ancient. The main tree is oak, with and understorey which includes wych elm, crab apple and guelder rose. Flowers include primroses and bluebells, and in wetter areas there are ragged robin and marsh bedstraw. The woods have the largest British breeding colony of the nationally rare black hairstreak butterfly.

"Ruth Janetta Temple

Ruth Janetta Temple (1892–1984) was an American physician who was a leader in providing free and affordable healthcare and education to underserved communities in Los Angeles, California. She and her husband, Otis Banks, established the Temple Health Institute in East Los Angeles, which became a model for community-based health clinics across the country.

Early life
Ruth Janetta Temple was born in Natchez, Mississippi, in 1892 to Amy Morton and Richard Jason Temple. She was her parents' second-born child. Her siblings included Walter, Vivian, Richard, Ethel, and Lanier Temple. Two other siblings died at a young age.

Temple's parents stressed the importance of education and humanism. Her father, a Baptist minister and graduate of Denison University, especially stressed the importance of looking beyond racial barriers and therefore made his home to be a place where people of all backgrounds could congregate. He even shared his personal collection of books written in Greek and Hebrew with Jewish, Catholic and Protestant theologians who needed them for research. Her father felt that, ""People will come into our house. All people, all kinds of people, of all race all creeds, all colors, and all educational backgrounds. Our children will learn love before they learn hate."" His perspective on race had a strong impact on Temple's life and made it easier for her to work in integrated spaces in her adult life. Temple's mother shared her husband's community spirit. She frequently invited people who were less fortunate into their home for food and clothing.

Two years after her father died in 1902, Temple and her family moved to southeast Los Angeles. Originally her mother had homeschooled her children, but she had to go back to work as a nurse to provide for her family. So Ruth had to act as a mother while she was gone. When Temple was 13, her oldest brother Walter, was experimenting with gunpowder outside. He put it into a hose and lit it, causing the gunpowder to blow up in his face. Ruth ran over to her brother who was lying on the ground, grabbed his head and turned it to her. Brushed the soot and powder off his face. She realized he hadn't done much damage, except from a singed eyebrow. After this she saw the possibility of helping others and taking pain away, from then on she wanted to be a physician. In another event Ruth was even more determined to be a physician. One day the Temple's neighbors son, Ernie Fennell, fell into an oil ditch in the area and was carried away for a quarter of a mile. When he was rescued he was covered with oil and wasn't breathing. Ruth knelt down and gave Ernie CPR. After a few moments he began coughing and breathing. One day Juliette Estelle Troy an African American Seventh-day Adventist witnessed to the Temple family. The Troy family and Temple family became the founding members of the Furlong Track Church, the first African American Seventh-day Adventist church in the West, founded in 1908.

Education
Temple enrolled in the College of Medical Evangelists (Loma Linda University) in 1913 and became the first African American woman to graduate from this institution. Temple's family could not afford to fund her college education, but T.W. Troy, a prominent member of the Los Angeles Forum, a black men's civic organization, arranged for the group to pay Temple's tuition. Troy continued to sponsor her education until she graduated with a bachelor's degree in medicine in 1918. She then interned in 1921 at the Los Angeles City Health Department, where she specialized in obstetrics and gynecology. After over twenty years of service in the medical profession, Temple was accepted in the Public Health master's program at Yale University in 1941, and the Los Angeles City Health Department awarded her with a scholarship to support her advanced educational endeavors.

Career
Upon graduation from Loma Linda, Temple began working to create public health services to underserved low-income communities in Los Angeles. She opened the first medical clinic in Southeast Los Angeles, a city of 250,000 people. Funding for the clinic was scarce, so she and her husband Otis Banks turned their newly purchased five-bedroom bungalow into the Temple Health Institute. The institute was a free medical clinic that discussed common community issues such as substance abuse, immunization, nutrition and sex education. Temple found it important to educate adults and children; she wanted people to be self-sufficient, so that nothing would prevent them from getting the resources they need to maintain a healthy life.

She developed, within the institute, community-based programs like the Total Health Program, the Health Study Center, and the Health Study Club. These programs were designed to educate patients and other local residents about the resources available not only in her clinic, but also in the larger community. These services were offered in schools, PTAs, YWCAs, churches, synagogues, service agencies, private medical practices, study clubs, block-to-block trainings, and local health information centers. Her program gained national attention with acronyms like ABC, which stands for ""Acquiring basic health knowledge, Bringing into practice what is learned, and Communicating it to contacts"". Even after her retirement in 1962 Temple continued to work in the public health service.

Temple was a member of the American Medical Association, the Women's University Club, the California Medical Association, the California Congress of Parents and Teachers, and Alpha Kappa Alpha.

Legacy
Temple died in 1984 at age 91. A year prior to her death, the East Los Angeles Health Center was renamed the Dr. Ruth Temple Center in her honor.

"Temple Beth El (Madison, Wisconsin)

Temple Beth El, also known as Temple Beth-El, is a Reform synagogue in Madison, Wisconsin, in the United States. The synagogue was founded in 1939.

History
The synagogue's founding rabbi was Dr. Manfred Swarsensky. He was a Holocaust survivor who emigrated from Berlin, Germany, to the United States in 1939, established the synagogue, and was the rabbi of Temple Beth El for 36 years, until he retired. At the beginning, the synagogue had 12 members.

In 1950, when the synagogue had 150–200 families as members, it built the present synagogue building on land it had purchased on Arbor Drive, and dedicated the new building. By the end of Swarsensky's tenure, the synagogue had 400 families as members. The synagogue after his death created in his honor an annual lectureship, known as the ""Swarsensky Weekend"".

Rabbi Kenneth Roseman, who has a Ph.D. in Jewish history, was the rabbi of the synagogue following Swarsensky, from 1976 to 1985. He was followed by Rabbi Jan Brahms, who served for nineteen years before deciding in 2004 to take a post at a smaller congregation in The Woodlands, Texas. Brahms was known for his interfaith activities and for his many columns on religious topics for The Capital Times newspaper.  During Brahms' tenure the congregation grew from 480 families to about 700.
After Brahms,  Daryl Crystal served as rabbi on an interim basis until the current rabbi, Jonathan Biatch, took the position in 2005.

Lawrence Kohn served as Education Director for 35 years, starting in 1979. Henry James Cargas was the first Rabbi Manfred Swarsensky Scholar at the synagogue, in 1982.

In 2008, the Madison Jewish Community Day School opened in rented space at Temple Beth El. Beginning in February 2014, the synagogue hosted Beth Israel Center’s after-school services while renovations were underway at Beth Israel for six months. The synagogue had to postpone a planned group trip to Israel scheduled for August 2014 due to fighting in Israel.  Rabbi Biatch said: ""There's a great deal of disappointment. But there is optimism that we will go eventually.""

National Football League player Gabe Carimi, now a guard and tackle for the Atlanta Falcons, and his family attended the synagogue as he grew up. Carimi celebrated his bar mitzvah at the synagogue, and helped in the synagogue's Hebrew school when he was in high school.

In 2014, the synagogue had 650 member families. The congregation is a member of the Union for Reform Judaism.  Its members reflect Madison’s demographic as the seat of state and county government, home of the University of Wisconsin, and a regional center for medical care, scientific research, and business.

"John Doucette

John Arthur Doucette (January 21, 1921 – August 16, 1994) was an American character actor who performed in more than 280 film and television productions between 1941 and 1987. A man of stocky build who possessed a deep, rich voice, he proved equally adept at portraying characters in Shakespearean plays as well as in Westerns and in modern crime dramas. He is perhaps best remembered, however, for his villainous roles as a movie and television ""tough guy"".

Early years
John Doucette was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, the eldest of three children of Nellie S. (née Bishop) and Arthur J. Doucette. During his childhood, his family moved frequently as his father sought work during the Great Depression. He completed grammar school in Haverhill, Massachusetts; graduated from Lincoln High School in Los Angeles, California; and later, in April 1943, he enlisted in the United States Army and served in Europe as an infantry rifleman during World War II. With regard to Doucette's early experience and training as an actor, he began to perform on stage at the age of 15 in plays at his high school. He subsequently performed at the Pasadena Playhouse before being cast in Hollywood films in the early 1940s.

Film career 
Doucette's film debut, in an uncredited role as a reporter, in Footsteps in the Dark in 1941. He appeared uncredited in at least two other movies before his budding film career was interrupted by his military service during World War II. Following his discharge, he resumed acting in Hollywood, where he soon began to receive more substantial, credited roles in releases by smaller production companies, such as The Burning Cross and The Road to the Big House for Somerset Pictures Corporation in 1947. Doucette continued to progress in obtaining dramatic roles for larger studios, including a small part as an architect in The Fountainhead in 1949 and in the 1970 epic Patton when he portrays 3rd Infantry Division Commander Major General Lucian K. Truscott. His other notable performances include bit parts in High Noon, The Robe, Sierra, and the mega-budget Cleopatra. More familiarly, Doucette also appears in the John Wayne films The Sea Chase, The Sons of Katie Elder, True Grit, and Big Jake.

Television
Many baby boomers first saw Doucette as the bad guy on television in several episodes of The Lone Ranger. Performing as an outlaw proved to be a natural role for him, considering his rough looks, commanding presence, and skill with a gun. He was considered by many to be among the fastest draws in Hollywood. His roles, however, went well beyond that stereotype. He appeared on a variety of television shows, including The Time Tunnel, Racket Squad, The Range Rider, The Roy Rogers Show, The Fugitive, The Adventures of Kit Carson, The Cisco Kid, City Detective, Annie Oakley, The Joseph Cotten Show: On Trial, My Friend Flicka, Sky King, The Californians, Broken Arrow, The People's Choice, Sheriff of Cochise, Behind Closed Doors, The Texan, Lawman, The Everglades, Mackenzie's Raiders, Bonanza, The Wild Wild West, The Virginian, Have Gun - Will Travel, Kung Fu, The Rat Patrol, Hogan's Heroes, Adventures of Superman, Sea Hunt, Science Fiction Theatre, Walt Disney Presents, and Tales of Wells Fargo.

Doucette portrayed police Lieutenant Tom Gregory on the television version of Big Town. Between 1959-1961, he also played police Lieutenant Weston on the series Lock-Up, the character Aaron William Andrews in the comedy The Partners, and the bounty hunter Lou Gore in the episode ""Dead Aim"" on the series Colt .45

Doucette was cast  on television as the Apache Chief Geronimo: for the 1958 episode ""Geronimo"" on the Western series Tombstone Territory. He was also cast in 1961 as Captain Cardiff in The Americans, a 17-episode NBC series, starring Darryl Hickman, about how the American Civil War divided families.

Personal life and death
John Doucette in 1948 married opera singer Katherine Sambles, with whom he had eight children. Katherine died in 1991; and three years later, on August 16, 1994, John died at age 73 at his home in Banning, California. His mausoleum is at Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

"SønderjyskE Ishockey

SønderjyskE (Ice hockey) is a professional ice hockey team playing in the top Danish ice hockey league Metal Ligaen. The team is part of SønderjyskE which is a sports umbrella with football, handball and ice hockey teams. The team plays home games in Vojens, a small town in the southernmost part of Jutland. SønderjyskE is the only team in Denmark which home arena has a narrow sized rink (common in North America and the NHL), whereas all other rinks in the country are standard IIHF sized rinks. Most of the club's foreign players are also originating from North America. SønderjyskE Ishockey Support is the fan club and the biggest icehockey fan club in Denmark with more than 800 members.

History
Vojens Ishockey Klub (VIK) was founded January 5, 1963 by Jens Peder Hansen on Fuglesøen, at that time an icy lake in Vojens. In 25 years Jens Peder Hansen ran the club as chairman. In the early years he was goalie and later coach for the elite team.

In 1965 the club was promoted to the top league in Denmark - 1. Division. In 1973 the club started to play indoor in the new Vojens Skøjtehal. After winning 3 championships with key players as Egon Kahl, Steen Schou, and George Galbraith, the club began to struggle in the 1980s and was relegated in 1987. Promotion in 1989 was followed by relegation the next year, but since 1992 the club has played in the top league in Denmark. Since 2004 as part of the SønderjyskE organisation.

SønderjyskE as an organisation was formed in 2004. In the 2003-04 season the hockey club was named IK Sønderjylland, from 1997 to 2003 Vojens Lions and prior to this Vojens Ishockey Klub (founded 1963). VIK still is the owner of the league license and runs the amateur teams in the club. In January 2011 the team moved to the new Syd Energi Arena (5,000 spectators, in 2018 named Frøs Arena) that is built in connection to their secondary arena Vojens Skøjtehal (2,300).

The top goalscorer in the club is Egon Kahl. Kim Lykkeskov is the record holder for most games played (811 games). Former goalie Alfie Michaud has picked up several club records and in 2010 a Danish league record for time played without goals against. Alfie Michaud managed to play 360 minutes and 58 seconds without any goals against.

"Otto von Bressensdorf

Ottone Eugeno Camelio Bresselau, who claimed to be Otto von Bressensdorf, was a German-born fraudster in United States. The family name of the Austrian noble von Bressendorfs is Bresselau, Otto is a nickname for Ottone.

In the 1980s, Baron Otto von Bressendorf created an investment house that he named Lyons Capital. Lyons Capital attracted entrepreneurs who were looking for capital to start a business or expand their existing business. The company required a finder's fee of $10,000 - 30,000 and claimed a 70% success rate.

In fact, according to later FBI indictment, none of the customers received any financing. The company earned about $1 million a year. The Bressendorfs used the money to furnish their house. Some of the businesses went bankrupt and unsuccessfully sued Lyons Capital.

In 1993, the Bressendorfs moved to Richmond, Virginia and moved their business there. They also joined the local high society.

On January 21, 1998, the FBI indicted them for 209 counts of fraud, wire fraud and money laundering. At the time, even the citizenship of his wife was in doubt. In October of that same year, von Bressensdorf and his wife were sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison.

"Bacurius the Iberian

Bacurius () was a Roman general and a member of the royal family of Iberia (modern Georgia) mentioned by several Greco-Roman authors of the 4th and 5th centuries. It is accepted, but not universally, that all these refer to the same person, an Iberian ""king"" or ""prince"", who joined the Roman military ranks. Scholarly opinion is divided whether Bacurius can be identified with one of the kings named Bakur (), attested in medieval Georgian annals, who might have taken refuge in territories obtained by the Eastern Roman Empire during the Roman–Persian Wars that were fought over the Caucasus.  

Ammianus Marcellinus, Tyrannius Rufinus, and Zosimus report that Bacurius was ""king of Iberians"", but Gelasius of Caesarea does not call him king, but merely scion of the kings of Iberia. Bacurius was a tribunus sagittariorum at the Battle of Adrianople with the Goths in 378 and then served as dux Palaestinae and comes domesticorum until 394, when he became magister militum and commanded a ""barbarian"" contingent in Emperor Theodosius I’s (r. 379–395) campaign against the Roman usurper Eugenius and met his death, according to Zosimus, at the Battle of the Frigidus. According to Socrates of Constantinople, Bacurius had also fought in Theodosius's earlier campaign against Magnus Maximus.

All contemporary sources are unequivocal in praising Bacurius's military skills and courage. Rufinus, whom Bacurius visited several times on the Mount of Olives and served him as a source of Christianization of Iberia, describes the general as a pious Christian, while the rhetorician Libanius, with whom Bacurius held correspondence, evidently regards him as a pagan and praises him both as a soldier and a man of culture. The oldest Georgian Bir el Qutt inscriptions mention Bacurius.

"B. H. Carroll Theological Institute

B. H. Carroll Theological Institute is an accredited Christian Baptist institution in Irving, Texas with multiple sources of funding and a self-perpetuating board of governors. It is named after Benajah Harvey Carroll and teaches Baptist principles and practices. It operates in cooperation primarily with Baptist churches, and also cooperates with other Great Commission Christians. The institution offers classes in both conventional classroom settings and by innovative means. It trains students in ""“teaching churches” located in multiple Texas cities, as well as through interactive lessons taught over the Internet"", with 20 such ""teaching churches"" in operation throughout Texas as of November 2006. The school plans to focus on the use of distance education to make it easier for students to obtain theological education. As of 2006, the school's second year of operation, B. H. Carroll Theological Institute had 300 students taking courses and an additional 300 students auditing courses. Bruce Corley was Carroll's first president; Gene Wilkes is Carroll's second president.

In January 2007, the Institute was certified to grant degrees by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, and was later exempted from such certification through a ruling of the Texas State Supreme Court. In late February 2012, B. H. Carroll Theological Institute received accreditation status from the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE). Carroll is listed among Institutions and Programs accredited by recognized U.S. Accrediting Organizations by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation(CHEA).. In 2017, Carroll received accreditation as a member of the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada (ATS)..

History

The Institute's founding chancellor is Russell H. Dilday, a former president of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary of the Southern Baptist Convention. Dilday was fired from Southwestern in March 1994 by what had become majority conservative-leaning board of trustees during the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence.

Dilday wrote of a 'lively renaissance of Baptist theological education at the edge of a new millennium' prior to the launch of the Institute. At the 2006 installation of the Institute's president and first administrators, Dilday indicated that 'the time is right for such a school as the Carroll Institute.'

The four inaugural faculty members at Carroll all formerly taught at Southwestern. including Corley, who was a professor of New Testament and Greek and the Dean of the School of Theology there. Corley was awarded both a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) and Doctor of Theology (Th. D.) from Southwestern. The Institute's representatives express no competition existing between the residential-model of education exemplified by Southwestern and their own non-residential model. In a guest post for the National Association of Baptist Professors of Religion Southwest Region NABPR-SW blog, Corley suggests schools like the Institute can help 'bridge the gap between where the seminaries are and what their publics need.'

Corley stepped down as President in October, 2013; Dr. Gene Wilkes of Legacy Church of Plano, Texas, was elected as Carroll's 2nd President in October 2013 and was inaugurated in February 2014.
With both Baylor and Southwestern's historic links to the man, some contention developed over the adoption of the name of B.H. Carroll by the Institute, as Carroll was the founding president of Southwestern Seminary. Writing long before the controversy, Leon McBeth testifies to the importance of Benajah Harvey Carroll's legacy to Baylor University and Southern Seminary as well as to modern Baptist history, describing the man as 'the John Wayne of Texas Baptists.'

After headquartering in Arlington, Texas for several years, the Institute moved to its ""first permanent location"" in Irving beginning in May 2015.

Academics and Accreditation
According to the Carroll Institute's website, ""the institute is a graduate-level community of faith and learning dedicated to equipping men and women called to serve Christ in the diverse and global ministries of His church"". Carroll applied for accreditation with the Association of Theological Schools (ATS) and was accredited by ATS in 2017.. Previously, Carroll applied for accreditation with the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE)in 2010, and was accredited by the Association in 2012. Prior to this step, the Institute was granted a Certificate of Authority to offer master's and doctoral degrees by state of Texas'Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) in 2007. With its THECB certification, the school began offering programs leading to a Master of Divinity degree with major in Christian Ministry, Master of Music degree with major in Christian Ministry or a Master of Arts degree with majors in Theology, Education, and Music. When THECB ceased regulating degree-granting religious institutions in 2008, Carroll was granted exemption from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.

Library
The institute's library received a donation of nearly 5,000 volumes from Eddie Belle Newport, widow of John Newport, longtime academic vice president at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. An additional 500 volumes were donated by Lois Hendricks, widow of longtime theology professor William Hendricks. In addition to its print materials, the Carroll webpage discusses a 'NexLearn Online Library' consisting of electronic resources available to students via their online classroom environment.

"Gerber format

The Gerber format is an open ASCII vector format for printed circuit board (PCB) designs. It is the de facto standard used by PCB industry software to describe the printed circuit board images: copper layers, solder mask, legend, drill data, etc.

The official website contains the specification, test files, notes and the Reference Gerber Viewer to support users and especially developers of Gerber software.

Gerber is used in PCB fabrication data. PCBs are designed on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems output PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the fabrication data contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.

There are two major generations of Gerber format:
 Extended Gerber, or RS-274X. This is the current Gerber format. In 2014, the graphics format was extended with the option to add meta-information to the graphics objects. Files with attributes are called X2 files; those without attributes are X1 files.
 Standard Gerber, or RS-274-D. This obsolete format was revoked.

The standard file extension is .GBR or .gbr though other extensions are also used.

PCB fabrication data

PCBs are designed on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems then outputs PCB fabrication data to allow fabrication of the board. Fabrication data contains a Gerber file for each image layer and drill span (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...)  though for historic reasons the Excellon format is also sometimes used for drilled hole information(though Gerber files usually contain data this format lacks). Typically, all these files are ""zipped"" into a single archive that is sent to the PCB bare board fabrication shop. The  fabricator loads them into a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) system to prepare data for each step of the PCB production process.

The .FileFunction attribute is the standardized method to link each layer in the PCB with its corresponding Gerber file in the fabrication data. If attributes are not supported only informal methods are available. A simple informal method is to express the file function clearly in the file name. Sometimes the file extension is abused to indicate the file function - e.g. .BOT for the bottom layer rather than the standard extension .GBR.  In industry this is considered poor practice and engineers should use the appropriate X2 attribute instead.

PCB Fabrication Data must comply with a number of rules: all layers must be aligned, a profile layer must be included, etc.

The CAD netlist can be embedded in the Gerber files. However, for historic reasons, netlists often are described in a separate file in IPC-D-356A, an electrical test format.

The material stack up, components and finishes are typically provided in informal text files or drawings. In 2018 Ucamco has published a specification for an extension of the Gerber format to cover this fabrication documentation.

Extended Gerber
RS-274X, extended Gerber or X-Gerber, was originally released in September 1998.

It is a human readable ASCII format. It consists of a stream of commands generating an ordered stream of graphics objects. The graphics objects can be positive or negative. Superimposed in the correct order they create the final image.

A Gerber file contains the complete description of a PCB layer image without requiring any external files. It has all the imaging operators needed for a PCB image. Any aperture shape can be defined. Planes and pads can be specified without the need to paint or vector-fill as in Standard Gerber. (However some implementations still use painting, problematical for the users of those files.)

Released in February 2014, Gerber X2 adds additional metadata to the image. Attributes allow to add metadata to a Gerber file. Attributes are akin to labels providing information associated with image files, or features within them. Examples of metadata conveyed by attributes are:
 The function of the file. Is the file the top solder mask, or the bottom copper layer, etc.?
 The part represented by the file. Does it represent a single PCB, an array, a coupon?
 The function of a pad. Is the flash an SMD pad, or a via pad, or a fiducial, etc.
For more information about attributes see X2 FAQ or intro video in the external links.

Fabrication documentation such as finish, overall thickness and materials is specified in a separate Gerber Job File.

Standard Gerber (revoked)
Standard Gerber was a numerical control (NC) format designed by Gerber Systems Corp to drive their vector photo plotters for the PCB industry in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a subset of the Electronic Industries Association RS-274-D specification, a format to drive mechanical NC machines in a wide range of industries. It was widely used to drive vector plotters.

Standard Gerber was revoked in 2014 by its developer, Ucamco. It is obsolete since 1998, when the Extended Gerber specification was published. It is superseded by extended Gerber X1 or X2. 

Standard Gerber was a simple ASCII format consisting of commands and XY coordinates.

A Standard Gerber is not an image description standard but only an NC standard: essential image information such the coordinate unit and the apertures definitions are not standardized. (Apertures are the basic shapes, similar to fonts in a PDF file.) The unit and apertures are described in a free-format text file, called an aperture file or a wheel file, intended for human reading. There are no standards for wheel files. The sender and receiver of Standard Gerber files have to agree on these case-by-case. 

Standard Gerber supports only the simple imaging operators that a vector plotter is capable of - drawing tracks and flashing apertures. This is insufficient for efficient PCB fabrication data. Copper pours must be created by painting (aka stroking or vector-filling) them with a vast number of tracks.  All but the simplest pads are also painted because of the cost of describing and creating a corresponding physical aperture. Painting creates the intended image but results in very large files that take long time to process and need error-prone manual work in CAM. 

Standard Gerber was intended for a manual workflow using an NC machine called a vector photoplotter: the plotter operator loads the paper tape with the Standard Gerber file on the plotter, manually sets the coordinate unit on the machine console and mounts the aperture wheel described in the accompanying wheel file. (An aperture wheel is a rotating disk on which physical apertures are mounted, and by rotating the wheel the photoplotter selects the aperture to use.) Standard Gerber  is not suitable for automated data transfer between PCB designers and manufacturers.

History
The Gerber file format was originally developed by the Gerber Systems Corp., a division of Gerber Scientific, founded by Joseph Gerber. The Gerber file format is now owned by Ucamco through its acquisition of Barco ETS, a company that previously acquired Gerber Systems Corp. The specification can be freely downloaded.

In 1980 the first edition of the Gerber Format: a subset of EIA RS-274-D; plot data format reference book was published by Gerber Systems Corporation, the pioneer of vector photoplotters. Gerber Scientific Corporation used a subset of EIA RS-274-D to drive their line of vector photoplotters. This format became known as Standard Gerber. In the 1980s, Standard Gerber was adopted by several other photoplotter vendors and also  systems for PCB manufacturing. It became the de facto standard image format.

In 1991 with the availability of the more capable raster photoplotters, the Gerber format was extended for polygon areas and ""mass parameters"". It became a superset of RS-274-D standard Gerber. These allow the user to dynamically define apertures of different shapes and sizes, as well as defining polygon area fills without the need for ""painting"". This created a family of input formats, each one dedicated to the capabilities of the different Gerber plotter models. The impetus to develop the Extended Mass Parameters was provided by AT&T.

In September 1998 the RS-274X Format User's Guide was published by Barco – Gerber Systems Corporation. (Gerber Systems Corporation had been taken over by Barco in April 1998 and operated under the name Barco- Gerber System Corporation. Barco's PCB division is now called Ucamco). This specification unified the family of formats to a single image format, revoking a large number of model-specific constructs. The format became known as Extended Gerber or GerberX. Extended Gerber quickly superseded Standard Gerber as the de facto standard for PCB image data. It is sometimes called ""the backbone of the electronics industry"". A series of revisions clarifying the specification was published over the years, ending with revision H of January 2012.

In the course of 2012 the format was comprehensively reviewed in the great reform. A representative library of 10,000 files from all over the world was investigated to establish current practice. Constructs that were rarely or never used were deprecated or revoked. Constructs with conflicting interpretations were clarified. The specification document was re-organized and its quality improved. This resulted in revision I1 to I4 of the specification, published from December 2012 on. The result was a simple, but powerful format, focused on the current needs of the PCB industry. This version of the Gerber format was developed by Karel Tavernier and Rik Breemeersch from Ucamco.

In June 2013 Ucamco published a proposal to add three new commands to the Gerber format which allow inclusion of image attributes conveying metadata attached to the image and its components. It invited feedback from the Gerber users before committing these ideas to a firm specification. This process resulted in revision J1 on February 2014, updated with further revisions until revision 2015.07. Including metadata adds intelligence to the format. It converts a mere image description format to a full-fledged PCB data transfer format. This is called the second extension and results what is known as Gerber X2, Gerber X1 being the pure image format. Gerber X2 is fully backward compatible with X1, as the attributes do not affect the image. Gerber X2 was developed by Karel Tavernier, Ludek Brukner and Thomas Weyn.

In September 2014 Ucamco revoked Standard Gerber.

In August 2015 Ucamco published a draft specification adding nested step and repeat and block apertures to make panel descriptions more efficient, calling for comments from the user community. The final specification was published in November 2016 after substantial input. This revision was developed by Karel Tavernier and Rik Breemeersch. Shortly afterwards the Cuprum Gerber viewer developed the first implementation.

In July 2016 Ucamco published a draft specification to include netlist information in Gerber, calling for input from the user community. After a number of revisions of the draft triggered by input from users, the draft was finalized on 2 October 2016.

In March 2017 Ucamco published a draft specification to include fabrication documentation in Gerber calling for input from the user community. There was a lively discussion, the draft went through seven public revisions before being finalized early April 2018.

In June 2017 a free online Reference Gerber Viewer was made available by Ucamco as a complement to the specification. It is updated with new functionality from time to time. 

In October 2019 Ucamco published a draft specification to include component information in Gerber data, calling for comments from the user community. The proposal re-uses existing syntax and hence is backward compatible. Although it does not introduce new syntax it extends Gerber into a new domain, and the name Gerber X3 is suggested. The draft specification was developed by Karel Tavernier.

Related formats 
Over the years there have been several attempts to replace Gerber by formats containing more information than just the layer image, e.g. netlist or component information. None of these attempts have been widely accepted within the electronics manufacturing industry, probably because the formats are complex. Gerber remains the most widely used data transfer format.

"Robert Lewis Koehl

Robert Lewis Koehl (6 March 1922 – 6 July 2015) was an American U.S. Army Intelligence surveyor in Nazi German-occupied Europe during World War II, author, and a Professor Emeritus of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

After the end of the war, Koehl made a name for himself for his research on national socialism, notably of studies on Heinrich Himmler as Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood, as well as a pioneering work on the Nazi German :de:Volkstumspolitik during the Occupation of Poland (1939–1945). Koehl coined the term ""neofeudalism"" for the characterization of the national socialist rule, and completed an account of the history of the SS in 1983.

Biography 
Robert Lewis Koehl was born on 6 March 1922 in Chicago, Illinois. He studied in at Harvard University, where he was admitted as member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. In 1943, Koehl married Lieselotte Franziska Eisenhardt, who had emigrated from Nazi Germany in 1939, and the couple had three children.

During the World War II he interrupted his studies for the war service, serving as surveyor and interpreter for the U.S. Army Intelligence in Nazi German-occupied Europe.

Back in Harvard he acquired his Master of Arts in 1947 with the work A Prelude to the Third Reich. In 1950, he earned his Doctor degree on Heinrich Himmler as Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood. He subsequently taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, at University of Nebraska in Lincoln and from 1964 until his retirement 1997 in the Department of Educational Policy Studies of University of Wisconsin-Madison in Madison, a department of which he was an early founder.

Research 
Koehl's work focused on European history, especially the history of national socialism. His doctorate thesis, published in revised form in 1957, was mainly based on material of the RuSHA trial, and for a long time was one of few papers on the National Socialist Settlement and Population Policy in the German occupation of Poland.

Inspired by the feudalism concept, Koehl coined the term ""neofeudalism"" to describe national socialism. He wanted in particular to grasp the domination conditions in the German-occupied East, where German rule was personalized and local commanders had absolute power.<ref>Hans Mommsen: 'Cumulative radicalization and progressive self-destruction as structural determinants of the Nazi dictatorship . In: Ian Kershaw & Moshe Lewin (Hg.):  Stalinism and Nazism. Dictatorship in Comparison .</ref> This was an early attempt to understand the irrational aspects of national socialism. In pointing out the similarities between the charismatic elements of medieval and national socialist rule, Koehl opposed later attempts to conceive of national socialism as charismatic rule in the sense of Max Weber. However, recent research does not follow Koehl's assumption that the feudalist power relations originated from the atavistic ideology of national socialism.

Koehl also referred back to the term ""Concentration Camp - SS"". He thus designated a group of SS members in the concentration camps, which were not seconded to battlefields of the Waffen-SS. According to :de:Karin Orth, Koehl's concept of historical reality corresponds to a national socialist functioneer elite. For Koehl, SS perpetrators were ""social engineers"". In 1983 he presented a complete version of the SS.

"Jeyranbatan Ultrafiltration Water Treatment Plants Complex



Introduction 
Jeyranbatan Ultrafiltration Water Treatment Plants Complex (UF) which was designed to supply of Baku and Absheron Peninsula with drinking water, was put into operation on October 28, 2015. The capacity of the UF treatment plant is 6.6 cubic meters per second (570 000 cubic meters per day). The plants complex were chosen one of the most important water projects in the world in Global Water Summit in Abu Dhabi in 2016. Companies from the US, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Turkey and the Republic of Korea, as well as up to 30 local contractor organizations were involved in the construction of the complex.

Treatment technology of the UF treatment plant 

UF treatment plant processes water which is naturally purified in the Jeyranbatan reservoir with capacity of 186 million cubic meters. The raw water is primarily treated in the coarse screen building by using 7Nos 3000-micron automatic self-cleaning filters. Water transmitted from the raw water tank is treated at the highest level within 20 seconds passing through 200 micron filters firstly and then 0.02 micron filter modules. The treatment of the water is carried out in 5280 membrane filters.  This process is performed mechanically closed environment by application of automation controls without implementing any chemical treatment and natural mineral content of the water is fully preserved. Water produced in the pants meets the standards accepted by the World Health Organization as well as other international organizations.

Some quality indicators of water processed in the filters (chlorine residue, cloudiness, pH, TOC) are controlled online. More parameters of raw and treated water are studied and quality indicators are fully controlled in the laboratory of the complex. The volume, pressure of the water transmitted to the plant, each stage of process of water, storing, and transportation processes are fully automated. All technological processes are managed in the SCADA control center.

Processed water is collected in the treated water tank with capacity of 10.000 cubic meters and is pumped to the Absheron reservoir which locates at 118 meters above sea level and water is distributed to the networks by gravity.

Jeyranbatan-Zira transmission main with total length of 83,5km (DN1600-1000mm), and Saray, Balakhani, Ramana, Gala, Zira reservoirs with a total capacity of 90,000 cubic meters which are located along the route of Jeyranbatan-Zira transmission main were constructed in order to provide water to Baku and other residential areas. More than 1 million inhabitants of peninsula have been provided with high quality and sustainable drinking water by this infrastructure.

Structure of the UF treatment plant 

The UF treatment plant include 5280 filter modules with capacity of 1,25 l/sec each, 13 thousand valves and equipment, 116 pumps, 6 transformers, flow meters, backwash and chemical dosing pumps, ventilation, heating and cooling systems, energy block, generator, transformer, as well as working rooms, conference hall, SCADA control room. 

3Nos intake pipelines (DN1600mm) were constructed for taking water from the reservoir by applying tunnel boring machine method. A water distribution chamber was built on the shore of the reservoir in order to control volume of the supplied water and adjust raw water capacity to meet the needs of the plants. 4 pipelines with diameter of 1400 mm were laid from the water distribution chamber to the UF treatment plant.

30km of pipelines of in varied diameter range, 242 km of electrical and 13 km of fiber optic cables, 7120 tons rebar, 3000 ton steel structure, 65 thousand cubic meters concrete were used during construction of the complex. Approximately 700,000 cubic meters of earthworks was performed, 19500 square meters of area was covered with asphalt and greenery work has been carried out in the area of 28000 square meters.

The Japan Under-19 cricket team represents Japan in Under-19 cricket players at the international level.

Japan participated in the East Asia-Pacific Regional Under-19 Qualifier for the first time since 2011. In their three prior appearances - 2007, 2009 and 2011 - Japan had only won one of 11 matches, a 24-run win over Fiji.

It took part in the 2020 Under-19 Cricket World Cup qualification ICC East Asia-Pacific tournament as hosts, held at Sano International Cricket Ground in Sano, Japan  Japan defeated Samoa by 174 runs in the first game, Vanuatu by 70 runs in the second game, and Fiji by 4 wickets in the third game to be undefeated heading into the final round-robin game against Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea was also undefeated, meaning the winner would go through to the Under-19 World Cup. Before the match, 11 PNG players were suspended by Cricket PNG for violating the code of conduct. This meant that Papua New Guinea had to forfeit the game and Japan qualified for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup for the first time in their history. They finished in 16th and last place in the tournament, losing all their matches, apart from the fixture against New Zealand which was washed out.

"HM Prison Chelmsford

HM Prison Chelmsford is a Category B men's prison and Young Offenders Institution, located in Chelmsford, Essex, England. The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service.

History
Chelmsford Prison began as a county jail in 1830 before transforming into a Category B prison, a young person's prison, and a local prison. It was expanded in 1996.

In 1999 the management at Chelmsford Prison were severely criticised by the Chief Inspector of Prisons, after findings that staff were failing to respond to cell alarms five years after a prisoner was beaten to death by his cell-mate. The prison was also criticised for unacceptably bad conditions of cleanliness. A further inspection a year later confirmed these failings at the prison. In 2002, ""conditions at Chelmsford...[were] condemned as 'poor and cramped' by the gaol's board of visitors.""

However, in 2005, Chelmsford was praised in its inspection for improving standards and procedures for inmates at the prison. This was confirmed a year later by the Independent Monitoring Board which praised the new management at the prison.

On 25 December 2007, 18-year-old Abdullah Hagar Idris hanged himself in the prison after he was told that he was going to be deported.

In January 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that older parts of Chelmsford prison will close, with a reduction of 132 places at the goal.

In December 2015 a riot lead to six members of staff needing hospital treatment.

The prison today
Chelmsford Prison accepts adult male prisoners and Young Offenders, convicted or on remand direct from courts within its local catchment area.

Education at the prison is contracted to Milton Keynes College, and courses offered include literacy, numeracy, information technology, art, barbering, journalism, cookery, ESOL as well as social and life programs. The prison's gym also offers physical education with industry-related qualifications, as well as recreational gym.

In addition, the prison has links to, and facilities provided by, organisations such as the Job Centre and the Samaritans. There is also a Prison Visitor Centre operated by the Ormiston Children and Families Trust.

Staffing at the prison has been reduced by 25%. According to the Independent Monitoring Board bullying, violence and self-harm have increased markedly at the prison due to staff shortages.  Budget cuts and the inability of the prison service to recruit and retain staff lead to fears for prison safety.  The prison is becoming more dangerous and less effective.  Prison health care provided by Care UK is considered poor, there were delays in getting medication and reliance on agency staff to fill vacancies.

There is insufficient secure mental health accommodation outside’ the prison for the most vulnerable inmates. The Independent Monitoring Board stated that the ""level of service being provided to care for prisoners’ physical and mental health needs remains inadequate""  Due to staff shortages the staff were unable to provide engagement work or education for prisoners.  Illegal drugs are a problem. Use of force by staff is increasing and there is insufficient monitoring if this use is appropriate.  Prisoners must spend too long in their cells.  Physical and mental health services for prisoners were found to be inadequate.  The staff try to engage prisoners. Money is not available for needed renovation of the Victorian building.

Following the death of a vulnerable inmate in January 2017 and criticism by the Prison Ombudsman, Care UK announced it would end its healthcare contract there as the level of resource the prison service made available was insufficient.

Drug use is a serious problem at HMP Chelmsford according to HM Inspectorate of Prisons (42.6% of prisoners failed drug tests) and organised gangs supply prohibited items.  Inspectors describe, ""significant concerns about safety"" and excessive levels of violence, much of the violence is due to supply and use of prohibited substances.  Overcrowding and under-resourcing are blamed.  Peter Clarke said the rising violence, suicides, accessibility of drugs and bad living conditions made him consider using the Urgent Notification protocol, which would make the Justice Secretary take action.  In one month, prison authorities seized £15,000 worth of illegal goods.  There were 17 suicides at Chelmsford during the 8 years to 2018 and 5 of them were since the inspection in 2016.  For examples of suicides, see Notable former inmates.  Deborah Coles of Inquest said the prison was, ""incredibly unsafe [the rate of suicides] suggests that the plethora of recommendations following previous self-inflicted deaths have not been implemented. Inquests repeatedly identify the same systemic failings with dismal regularity.  Recent inquests into deaths at Chelmsford prison have highlighted failures around the management of self-harm procedures, a lack of staff training in mental health awareness, inadequate risk assessments and failures in responding to bullying.  The failure to implement existing guidelines on the care of those at risk indicates a lack of care, neglect and inhuman treatment from punitive and often inflexible prison regimes.""  Coles urged the setting up of a national group to supervise how lessons from inquests and reports are carried out, the group to be accountable to Parliament.  Problems inspectors drew attention to included that 40% of prisoners who did not take part in activities were locked in their cells for up to 22 hours a day and items including mattresses and pillows were in short supply.  The Howard League for Penal Reform maintain Chelmsford was designed to hold 521 men but the prison actually held 700 men when it was inspected.

Notable former inmates
 Ian Wright, former footballer
 Alfred George Hinds
 Warren Sampson, hanged himself in Chelmsford Prison on 4 September 2015.  Sampson's mother contacted the prison hours before his death because she was worried about messages he had sent her but the prison failed to safeguard Sampson.  The prison ombudsman said suicide and self-harm procedures, ""did not operate fully effectively"" and ""staff missed signs that Mr Sampson's vulnerability and risk of suicide had increased"".  Following a mental health review, a counsellor was worried about his anxiety and over a noose he had made, but prison staff did not, ""explore this further"".  The charity Inquest said Chelmsford Prison, with one of the highest suicide rates in the nation, made, ""the same systemic failings with dismal regularity"".
 Dean Saunders, 25, killed himself at HMP Chelmsford in January 2016.  An Inquest jury found Saunders was downgraded from continuous watch to half hour checks for financial reasons and neglect contributed to his death.  Care UK, a private company running healthcare at Chelmsford, ""treated financial consideration as a significant reason to reduce the level of observations"" although they were warned repeatedly about Dean's mental condition.  Dean's mother pleaded with staff to keep him under constant watch. The jury stated Mr Saunders ""and his family were let down by serious failings by mental health services and prison system"" and that assessing his mental health needs was ""not adequately conducted"" with ""multiple failings in recording and passing on information"".  Dean's family stated,  ""Hospital, not prison, is where Dean deserved and needed to be. We as a family, together with our lawyers and Inquest, want Dean's death to mark the end of empty promises and the start of change."" The Prison Ombudsman also found significant risk factors were ignored when observation of Dean Saunders was cut back.  The ombudsman found those trying to care for Dean felt he should be in a mental health facility rather than prison.  The ombudsman added,  ""I am also concerned that there appears to have been some confusion at Chelmsford about the process for transferring mentally ill prisoners to hospital, which meant that an opportunity to transfer Mr Saunders in December [of 2015] was missed.  Sadly, the criminal justice system did too little to protect this very vulnerable man."" Dean's father, Mark Saunders said, ""There was no proper medical structure there [in prison] to help him. We were lied to and mislead all the way through. We were devastated.""

"Tony Gigot

Tony Gigot (born 27 December 1990) is a French professional rugby league footballer who plays as a  or  for the Toronto Wolfpack as well as playing for France at international level. 

He previously played for the London Broncos, Toulouse Olympique, Sporting Olympique Avignon, Cronulla Sharks and the Catalans Dragons in two separate spells.

Background
Gigot was born in Avignon, France. His younger brother Samuel is a professional footballer.

Club career

Early career

Gigot spent time in the youth team at London Broncos. He signed with Catalans Dragons in 2010 and made his Super League debut that year, playing a total of 15 games and kicking two goals. He also represented Catalans in the 2010 Challenge Cup where he played 2 games and scored 1 try.

In 2011, Gigot played 7 games throughout the season for the Catalans Dragons, kicking 1 goal. He once again represented Catalans in the 2011 Challenge Cup, where he played 1 game.

As well as playing for the Catalans Dragons, in 2011 Gigot played 9 games on loan for Toulouse Olympique in the 2011 Championship. He scored 5 tries.

After being released by Catalans, Gigot signed with the Avignon Bisons to play in the 2012-2013 Elite One Championship.

Cronulla Sharks
Gigot was given an early release by Avignon at the start of 2013 so he could travel to Australia for a chance to play in the Australian National Rugby League (NRL) competition. Gigot spent pre-season training with St. George Illawarra Dragons before signing a one-year deal with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks. He did not feature for the Sharks at NRL level, however.

London Broncos
In February 2014, Super League club London Broncos announced the signing of Tony Gigot for the 2014 season. He played two matches and kicked four goals before leaving the club to re-sign with Avignon.

Return to Catalans
In May 2015, the Catalans Dragons announced the resigning of Gigot. He made his second debut for the club playing as a centre in a 37-34 victory over Featherstone Rovers in the Challenge Cup. The following week he made his Super League return for the Dragons, scoring a hat-trick in a 58-14 victory over Wigan Warriors.

He played in the 2018 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Warrington Wolves at Wembley Stadium.

Ban
On 10 February 2017 it was announced that Gigot had been banned for two years by the French rugby league authorities for an incident with an anti-doping official during a training camp in October 2016. It was reported that Gigot had not failed a drug test and that supported by his club, Gigot will appeal the ban.  An appeal against the length of the ban was successful and with the ban reduced to three months, Gigot was able to play again from April 2017.  However in August 2017 the full two year ban was reinstated by the French anti-doping agency for the ""inappropriate exchange"" with the anti-doping official.  Gigot and the club launched a further appeal which was successful and on 9 February 2018 it was announced that Gigot was free to resume playing.

On 5 August 2018 Gigot was named Man of the Match in Catalans' 35–16 victory over St. Helens in the semi-final of the Challenge Cup. At the end of the final on 25 August he was named as the winner of the Lance Todd Trophy, becoming the first French player to win the trophy as Catalan beat Warrington Wolves 20–14.

International career
Gigot made his first appearance for France in the 2010 European Cup, scoring one try. Tony played for France in the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, 2014 European Cup and 2015 European Cup, a tournament where Tony topped the try scoring charts with 4 tries in the 3 games France played. He played in the 2016 end of year test match against England in Avignon, kicking a goal in France's 6-40 loss.

"Gab (social network)

Gab is an English-language social media website known for its far-right user base. The site has been widely described as a ""safe haven"" for extremists including neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the alt-right.

The site was launched in 2017 and claimed to have almost 1,000,000 registered user accounts by July 2019. It has been noted to attract far-right and alt-right users and groups who have been banned from other social networks. The platform populace is primarily ""conservative, male, and Caucasian"". , the site's most-followed users included high-profile, far-right figures such as Richard B. Spencer, Mike Cernovich, and Alex Jones. Gab recognizes far-right websites such as Breitbart News and InfoWars as competitors, according to a March 2018 financial filing.

Gab claims to stand for free speech and individual liberty; though these claims have been criticized for being a shield of the alt-right ecosystem. Antisemitism is a prominent part of the site's content and the platform itself has engaged in antisemitic commentary. Researchers have written that Gab is ""known to be hateful"".

The site gained extensive public scrutiny following the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in October 2018, as Robert Gregory Bowers, the sole suspect, posted a message on Gab indicating an immediate intent to do harm before the shooting. Bowers had a history of making extreme, antisemitic postings on the site. After a backlash from hosting providers, Gab briefly went offline.

In February 2019, Gab launched Dissenter, a browser extension and website that allows Gab users to make comments on content hosted on any website via an overlay visible only to those logged into Dissenter or using the extension, and thus bypass their individual moderation practices. In April 2019, Dissenter was removed from the Firefox Add-ons website and the Chrome Web Store for violation of their policies. In July 2019, Gab switched its software infrastructure to a fork of Mastodon, a free and open-source social network platform. Mastodon released a statement in protest, denouncing Gab as trying to monetize racism under claims of free speech.

History

Gab

2016–2018
Gab was launched on August 15, 2016, in private beta, billing itself as a ""free speech"" alternative to social networking sites Twitter and Facebook. Co-founder and CEO Andrew Torba has cited ""the entirely left-leaning Big Social monopoly"" and an alleged bias against conservative articles by Facebook as his reasons for creating the site. Gab AI, Inc. was incorporated on September 6, 2016.

Torba said in November 2016 that the site's user base had expanded significantly following censorship controversies involving major social media companies, including the permanent suspensions of several prominent alt-right accounts from Twitter.

In December 2016, Apple declined Gab's submission of its app to the iOS App Store, citing pornographic content as the reason. At the same time, Twitter also cut off Gab's access to the Twitter API without specifying a reason. A revised version of the app that blocked pornography by default was also rejected for violating Apple's rules on hate speech.

In March 2017, Gab added Pro accounts and on May 8, 2017, Gab exited private beta testing. Also in May, Gab launched its Android app for the Google Play Store. In August 2017, GabTV, a live-streaming service, was launched for GabPro members.  On August 17, Google removed Gab's app from the Google Play Store for violating its policy against hate speech, stating that the app did not ""demonstrate a sufficient level of moderation, including for content that encourages violence and advocates hate against groups of people."" On September 14, 2017, Gab filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google but dropped the suit on October 22, 2017 in favor of lobbying Congress to take action against ""monopolized tech giants"".

In September 2017, Gab moved its headquarters to Pennsylvania. SEC filings, as late as March 2018, stated that Torba operated Gab out of a WeWork coworking space in Philadelphia. A WeWork spokesperson said that Torba had become a member under his own name, not Gab's, and that his time there had been brief. In late October, 2018, a Gab spokesperson told The Philadelphia Inquirer that Gab was no longer based in Philadelphia.

In September 2017, Gab faced pressure from its domain registrar AsiaRegistry to take down a post by The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin, giving Gab 48 hours to do so. Gab later removed the post. Danny O'Brien of the Electronic Frontier Foundation commented that this pressure was part of an increase in politically motivated domain name seizures.

On August 9, 2018, Torba announced that Microsoft Azure, Gab's host, had threatened to suspend the site for ""weeks/months"" if they failed to remove two antisemitic posts made by Patrick Little, a U.S. Senate candidate who had been ejected from the Republican Party for his antisemitism. According to The Verge, the posts ""express intense anti-Semitism and meet any reasonable definition of hate speech."" Gab's Twitter account asserted that Little had self-deleted the posts, but this was contradicted by Torba who said Gab itself had deleted the posts which ""unquestionably"" broke their ""user guidelines"". On the same day, Alex Jones interviewed Torba on The Alex Jones Show during his coverage of his own permanent ban from YouTube. Little was suspended indefinitely from Gab in late November, 2018, for encouraging harassment of private individuals; Gab stressed that although Little's account had posted hate speech, it was not the cause of the ban.

According to Gab's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, around 635,000 users were registered on Gab by September 10, 2018. On September 12, 2018, Gab purchased the Gab.com domain name from Sedo for $220,000 at Flippa.

In early-October 2018, Gab's Stripe account was suspended due to adult content on Gab. During the 2018 Brazilian presidential election many right-wing Brazilian political pages were banned from Facebook for breaching the site's hate speech rules. In response, many administrators of these pages began promoting Gab as an alternative platform; subsequently, Brazilians became the second-largest demographic of Gab users. Jair Bolsonaro's party, the Social Liberal Party, has an official Gab account. In December 2018, Gab sponsored Turning Point USA's ""Student Action Summit"" in Palm Beach, Florida. Days before the event, Turning Point USA removed Gab from the list of sponsors without explanation. Gab posted a press statement in protest.

2019
The company turned to cryptocurrency payment processing services after being rejected from PayPal and Stripe in the aftermath of the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. In January 2019, Coinbase and Square, Inc.'s Cash App closed the accounts held by Gab and Andrew Torba. On January 22, 2019, Gab announced that it had partnered with Second Amendment Processing (SAP), a Michigan-based payment processor. Gab removed SAP's credit card payment functionalities in March 2019, only accepting payment via cryptocurrency or check. The same month the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) published an investigation that found that SAP's founder had been convicted of financial crimes in 2007. Gab has not said why it removed the payment processor.

The SPLC reported on January 24, 2019, that Gab has misrepresented its services and bloated its user count in its filings and promotional materials. The GabTV service advertised on its StartEngine crowdfunding page  was only active very briefly in early 2018, and also , the dedicated page for the service is blank. Unlike other social media companies, Gab did not publish the count of its active users in 2018, and only reported registered accounts. Social media intelligence company Storyful found 19,526 unique usernames had posted content during a seven-day period between January 9 and January 16, 2019, far lower than Gab's claimed 850,000 registered users. Users of the site commonly mocked Torba for the site's emptiness, with some accused him of inflating user numbers. In a December 2018 filing, the company reported that 5,000 users were paying for its subscription services.

Shortly after the SPLC published its January report on Gab's misleading statements and financial struggles, the site made its Twitter account private until January 30, 2019, and switched to an invitation-only mode for new user registrations on January 30. Gab stated that switching to an invitation-only mode was an experiment to improve user experience. Gab previously had intermittent service outages for a week. Gab said that the outages were caused by bot attacks and blamed state actors along with paid ""activist bloggers"". Torba shared a post from another user that suggested that the ""deep state"" was responsible. The Daily Beast opined that this was an attempt to further obfuscate its numbers, in response to reports that it had inflated its user count.

, Gab pays Sibyl Systems Ltd. $1,175 a month for webhosting. The SPLC reported on February 14, 2019 that a software engineer for Sibyl Systems rejected Gab's claim of having more than 835,000 users and estimated the count to be in the range of a few thousands to a few tens of thousands. Sibyl Systems denied the statement via Twitter, saying that the employee did not have access to the secure data and that the employee had been dismissed.

On July 4, Gab switched its software infrastructure to run on a forked version of Mastodon, a free and open-source decentralized social network platform. The change attempted to circumvent the rejection of Gab's mobile app from the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store, as Gab users gained access to the social network through third-party Mastodon apps that did not subsequently block Gab. Mastodon released a statement the same day denouncing Gab as ""seek[ing] to monetize and platform racist content while hiding behind the banner of free speech"" and ""attempt[ing] to hijack our infrastructure"", and said that they had ""already taken steps to isolate Gab and keep hate speech off the fediverse."" Mastodon stated that most Mastodon instances had blocked Gab's domains, preventing interactions between these instances and Gab, and that Tusky and Toot!, two popular Mastodon mobile apps, had already blacklisted Gab's domains and banned Gab users from using their app. Mastodon also stated that by paywalling features that are otherwise freely accessible in other instances, Gab ""offer users no incentive to choose their platform"" and ""puts itself at a disadvantage compared to any Mastodon instance"". However, Gab does offer features which Mastodon doesn't have, such as groups.

Dissenter
On February 24, 2019, Gab launched a browser extension and website called Dissenter, which allows users of Gab to make comments about any webpage including news articles, YouTube videos, and individual social media posts. It is a social news aggregation and discussion service, created to allow commenting on any webpage outside of the site owner's control.

Dissenter describes itself as ""a free, open-source utility that allows people to dissent from orthodoxy and express what they are really thinking, without fear of reprisal"". It was developed as a response to multiple social media platforms' and online news sites' moderation practices, which involve removal of individual comments or deleting or disabling comment sections altogether. Users with registered Gab accounts may submit content to Dissenter in the form of a URL to a page on which they want to comment. This creates a discussion page where users can post a comment (or ""Dissent""), and the comments can be up- or down-voted by other users of the site. By using the Dissenter browser extension, users may read and post comments in an overlay while viewing page content. The Dissenter website also features a news ticker on which users can follow current events.

Shortly after its launch, fans of British far-right activist Tommy Robinson began using Dissenter to comment on a BBC article about Robinson's ban from social media websites following the removal of Mohammed's Koran, by Robinson and Peter McLoughlin, from Amazon. After Rotten Tomatoes announced that it would be removing its comment section on their review page for the Captain Marvel film due to concerns that trolls had planned to flood it with negative reviews, users of Dissenter used it to comment about the movie and Rotten Tomatoes' decision to remove comments.

In a 20-minute Periscope video accompanying the launch, Andrew Torba said that he expected Dissenter to be banned from extension stores, and mentioned that Gab might build its own web browser in the future that has Dissenter built in. In April 2019, Mozilla removed the Dissenter extension from the Firefox Add-ons website for violations of Mozilla's acceptable use policy that prohibits hate speech. In a statement to the Columbia Journalism Review, a Mozilla spokesperson said ""Mozilla does not endorse hate speech, and we do not permit our platforms to be used to promote such content."" On April 11, Google removed the Dissenter extension from the Chrome Web Store. Later in April, the Gab team forked the Brave browser in order to bundle Dissenter — a move which Brendan Eich criticized as unnecessary.

Following the addon's launch, Ana Valens of The Daily Dot described it as an ""extension for the alt-right"", to ""mobilize against journalists, critics, and progressive websites."" Saqib Shah of Engadget  called Dissenter ""a far-right comments section on every site"" and Gab's ""latest attempt at attracting fringe voices"". Izabella Kaminska wrote in the Financial Times, ""There is a clear demand for this sort of freedom. Some argue the concept is therefore a billion dollar idea with the potential to completely disrupt conventional media's control of its comment real estate""; in a follow-up article two weeks later she added ""... much horror still lurks on Dissenter – including hateful and anti-Semitic opinions that need challenging. This is precisely why it would be wrong to ignore the application. Doing so would encourage the build-up of silos that feed on their own twisted perspectives.""

Users and content

Users
The site has been noted to attract far-right or alt-right users who have been banned or suspended from other services. High-profile participants include former Breitbart writer and polemicist Milo Yiannopoulos, former British National Party leader Nick Griffin, Australian Neo-Nazis Blair Cottrell and Neil Erikson, white supremacists Richard B. Spencer, Tila Tequila, Vox Day, and Christopher Cantwell. Far-right political parties and party candidates including Britain First and UKIP candidates such as Mark Meechan and Carl Benjamin are other prominent participants.

Gab CEO Andrew Torba was himself removed from the Y Combinator alumni network because of harassment concerns, starting when he used ""build the wall"" on Twitter alongside a screenshot of a post by a Latino founder that read ""being a black, Muslim or woman in the USA is going to be very scary"". Until 2016, Torba was registered as a Democrat, although he voted for Donald Trump and other Republicans.

Torba has stated that Gab is ""not designed specifically for conservatives"" and has stated that ""we welcome everyone and always will"". In filings made with the SEC in March 2018, Gab stated that its target market is ""conservative, libertarian, nationalists and populist internet users around the world"", and listed far-right conspiracy theorist websites Breitbart News and InfoWars as its main competitors. He stated that ""We want everyone to feel safe on Gab, but we're not going to police what is hate speech and what isn't"".

In early 2018, a cross-university group released a research study on posts made to the site. According to that study, the site hosted a high volume of racism and hate speech, and primarily ""attracts alt-right users, conspiracy theorists, and other trolls"". The study listed Carl Benjamin, Ann Coulter, Alex Jones, Stefan Molyneux, Lauren Southern, and Paul Joseph Watson as some of the more popular users of the site. The authors also performed an automated search using Hatebase and found ""hate words"" in 5.4% of Gab posts, which they stated was 2.4 times higher than their occurrence on Twitter but less than half that found on /pol/, a political discussion board on 4chan. The authors of the study stated in their conclusion that while anyone can join Gab, the site is aligned with the alt-right and its use of free speech rhetoric ""merely functions as a shield for its alt-right users to hide behind.""

Another research study in late 2018 concluded that Gab is filled with extremist users. The study found that 35% of Gab users followed at least one extremist individual listed by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the SPLC. It found Gab profiles for 61% of the 36 individuals in the ADL's list of ""alt-right"" and ""alt-lite"" personalities. The number of posts and followers of these extremist Gab users far exceeds that of average Gab users, indicating that they are more active in the system. Among Gab's users, a majority are ""conservative, male, and Caucasian."" The study showed a great variety in the domains of URLs that are shared on Gab, and found that most of these domains are not popular in other social media or other parts of the Internet. A portion of these domains are known for spreading politics-related news. This led the researchers to the conclusion that Gab ""has become an echo chamber for right-leaning content dissemination.""

A report issued by the Anti-Defamation League and the Network Contagion Research Institute on March 12, 2019 found that when Twitter bans ""extremist voices"", Gab's user base grows.

Former Gab users include white nationalist political candidate Paul Nehlen, who was removed from the site for doxing the man behind the ""Ricky Vaughn"" Twitter account, and hacker, internet troll, and former Daily Stormer writer Andrew ""Weev"" Auernheimer, who was banned for calling for genocide against Jews and endorsing terrorist Timothy McVeigh. Auernheimer's activity prompted threats from Gab's then webhost Asia Registry to remove the comments or they would refuse to host the site. Christopher Cantwell, a white supremacist and neo-Nazi activist who ""once drove a significant amount of interaction on the small site"", was banned from the site in March 2019 after using the site to advocate in the wake of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings that future mass killers should target and murder left-wing activists, instead of ""random people in mosques and synagogues"", in order to effectively silence left-wing activism.

Following the Christchurch mosque shootings and a lowered tolerance on other social media for hate speech, several members of United Patriots Front, an Australian far-right extremist organization, have urged their supporters to follow them on Gab after being banned from Twitter and Facebook.

According to SimilarWeb, Gab's website traffic grew almost 200% between January and July 2019, and unique visitors to the site increased 180%.

Antisemitism and violence
Rita Katz, a researcher and analyst of terrorism and extremism, wrote on Politico that Robert Bowers' extreme antisemitic postings are ""anything but an anomaly"" on the website, and ""[they highlight] concerns about its growing facilitation of white nationalism and other far-right movements."" Gab user profiles often contain Nazi symbolism, and Stormfront users have praised the site as a place to post antisemitic content. Katz found that many Gab users were celebrating immediately after Bowers' massacre against the Tree of Life synagogue, and wrote that far-right communities' rise to popularity on Gab is ""remarkably similar"" to the rise of ISIS on social media. Joshua Fisher-Birch of the Counter Extremism Project has said that “Gab has always been attractive to fascist and neo-Nazi groups that advocate violence.""

The Jewish Chronicle in London found material on the site accusing Jews of responsibility for the September 11 attacks. After setting up a fake account on Gab, the newspaper's journalist Ben Weich was quickly ""presented with a steady stream of Holocaust denial, antisemitic tropes and conspiracy theories — as well as those venerating Adolf Hitler."" Posts he discovered included at least one user who used a swastika as their profile picture and stated ""The parasitic Jews will fully deserve the genocide that's coming upon them,"" and ""They do not not deserve mercy, expulsion will never fix a rat problem, extermination does."" The non-profit left-wing media collective Unicorn Riot discovered that individual Gab users led by alt-right figure Brittany Pettibone organized on the video game chat and voice room platform Discord, and that some of the discussions centered on antisemitism and achieving ""ethno-nationalism.""

The Gab platform itself has engaged in antisemitic commentary. In August 2018, in response to a post calling for the shutdown of the site, the platform's Twitter account responded with a post suggesting that it is unsurprising for a person with a Jewish last name to oppose ""free speech,"" and followed up with a citation to a Bible verse (Revelation 3:9) that referred to Jewish nonbelievers of Jesus Christ as members of the ""synagogue of Satan"". On October 31, 2018, The Washington Post pointed to two messages on the Gab Twitter account and wrote that they ""raise questions about whether they cross the line into impropriety."" One captioned a photo of two men, one with Jewish sidelocks, with ""I'm calling the cops on both and getting my shotgun ready, just saying"" and another argued for opposition to immigration by saying ""Let a bunch of Somalians migrate to your neighborhood and see if you change your mind."" Torba initially questioned the authenticity of the posts, suggesting they might be doctored images, later saying the posts were ""clearly satire/comedy . . . to get people discussing the importance of free expression for satire, comedy, political discourse, and legitimate criticism,"" and then later saying they were, ""a few edgy tweets posted by interns."" The tweets were later deleted.

In addition to allowing Holocaust denial and other forms of antisemitism, Gab has been used as a recruitment tool by several neo-Nazi and alt-right groups, including Identity Evropa, Patriot Front, and the Atomwaffen Division, a terrorist organization tied to a number of murders. In 2018, threats by a Gab user against an African-American member of the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee that included pictures of weapons and racial slurs prompted a police investigation, although no charges were ultimately filed. The user's previous posts had included one that asked ""Why aren’t we organizing and killing leftists in droves?""

Terrorism researcher and Queen's University professor Amarnath Amarasingam has said that Gab's position as neither an extremely mainstream service nor an obscure dark web network has allowed extremists to permeate the website and access an audience they would not be able to have on a more popular service, where they would be banned. He says this has allowed domestic terrorism organizations to grow within Gab's far right user base. Amarasingam has compared the messaging by these organizations on Gab to early ISIS recruitment efforts, involving tactics like sharing violent propaganda and establishing underground communication methods with potential members.

Gab has denied that terror groups flourish on the website, saying in a statement to Motherboard, ""We don't want them, we strongly discourage them from joining and we ban them when they cross the line, as they often do."" However, Ben Makuch of Motherboard wrote that neo-Nazi terrorist groups have ""enjoyed months-long, unfettered stints posting their content on Gab to a significant audience."" In addition to calls for terrorist attacks, mass killings against minorities, offline armed training recruitments and white supremacist propaganda accumulated on Gab, Makuch pointed to one Gab post, from a user who is a member of an multinational militant network on Gab connected to the Atomwaffen Division, that had explicitly called for its followers to attack electric grids. Other content posted by the network included explicit calls for sympathizers to join local neo-Nazi organizations and commit violence against Muslim and Jewish communities. In June 2019, two British men was arrested on terror offences for posting propaganda on Gab calling for their followers to assassinate Prince Harry.

2018 Pittsburgh synagogue shooting

Robert Gregory Bowers, the sole suspected shooter in the attack against a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, maintained an active, verified Gab account where he displayed the neo-Nazi code-phrase ""1488"" and a bio that said ""jews are the children of satan."" Just prior to the shooting, he used this account to post ""HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.  Screw your optics, I'm going in.""

After Bowers was arrested, Gab suspended his profile and contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). On October 27, 2018, soon after the shooting, PayPal, GoDaddy, and Medium terminated their relationship with Gab, and PayPal released a statement that it had it done so based on its review of accounts that may engage in the ""perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance"". Later on the same day, Gab announced on Twitter that Joyent, Gab's hosting provider, would terminate their service on October 29 at 9:00 am ET. The tweet said that the site expected to be down for weeks. Stripe and Backblaze also terminated their services with Gab after the shooting.

Gab had defended itself from criticism as a result of the shooting, saying that they ""refuse to be defined by the media’s narratives about Gab and our community. Gab’s mission is very simple: to defend free expression and individual liberty online for all people. Social media often brings out the best and the worst of humanity."" Since the shooting, Gab has received substantial media attention, having been relatively unknown by the general public prior to the attack.

After the site was taken down, Gab's homepage was changed to a message saying it was down due to being ""under attack"" and being ""systematically no-platformed"", adding that Gab would be inaccessible for a ""period of time"". Gab returned online on November 4, 2018 after Epik agreed to register the domain. Rob Monster, the CEO of Epik, had defended Gab's neo-Nazi users, and said that neo-Nazis on Gab are actually ""liberal trolls"" looking to ""give enemies of freedom an excuse"". On Gab, Christopher Cantwell replied to Monster's claims, stating ""We're not liberals, nor are the people trying to get us censored. The people trying to censor Gab are (((communists))), and the Nazis are the only ones willing to take them on...Eventually, everyone will have to pick a side.""

In January 2019, federal prosecutors filed 13 additional counts of hate crime charges against Robert Bowers under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, citing multiple antisemitic posts Bowers made on Gab during the span of more than two weeks prior to the shooting. Bowers is indicted with a total count of 63 charges, facing a maximum possible penalty of life without parole, and subsequent consecutive sentence of 250 years' imprisonment. Surpassing 22 counts of superseding indictment, Bowers is eligible for death penalty.

Reception
Gab has been described as ""Twitter for racists"" by Salon, a ""hate-filled echo chamber of racism and conspiracy theories"" by The Guardian, an ""online cesspool of anti-Semitism"" by Politico, a ""safe haven for banned Twitter trolls, Gamergaters, Pizzagaters and high-profile white nationalists"" by Mic, and ""the far-right’s favorite social network"" by The Verge. Wired criticized Gab for not explicitly prohibiting hate speech. Scholars have described Gab as ""hateful"", and named Gab along with 4chan and 8chan as directly radicalizing men who went on to commit violent acts. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) characterized Gab as a site where its users are ""radicalized aggressively"". Heidi Beirich, a director of the center, stated that the site is ""the number one place nowadays where white supremacists gather"". The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) called Gab a ""fringe online community"" and ""a bastion of hatred and bigotry.""

Harrison Kaminsky in Digital Trends questioned the site's longevity in September 2016, writing: ""While the site’s initial popularity is impressive, the potential is most likely short-lived, following the life cycle of social networks like Ello or Peach, which faded over time."" Maya Kosoff in Vanity Fair wrote ""the point of Gab may not be to grow to be a Twitter competitor ... it’s providing a 'safe space' for people who want to express themselves without consequence"". Amanda Hess, a critic at The New York Times, opined in November 2016 that the site is ""a throwback to the freewheeling norms of the old internet, before Twitter started cracking down on harassment and Reddit cleaned out its darkest corners. And since its debut in August, it has emerged as a digital safe space for the far right, where white nationalists, conspiracy-theorist YouTubers, and minivan majority moms can gather without liberal interference.""

Michael Edison Hayden, an open source intelligence analyst and investigative reporter on extremism and disinformation, opined in a Gizmodo interview in October 2018 that ""Andrew Torba, the CEO of Gab, will get angry when people ... call his site a white nationalist website or an alt-right website but anyone who spends time on it knows that it’s a haven for extremists, [...] Violent white supremacist groups like Patriot Front and Atomwaffen Division organize out in the open on Gab. Users frequently call for the murder of women, Jews and other minorities on Gab, and are rewarded with likes and reposts. [...] Dylann Roof is treated as a hero by many Gab users."" Hayden noted that Gab was ""rife with"" content similar to that posted by Robert Bowers', with many users posing in his support using the hashtag #HeroRobertBowers.

Joe Setyon reviewed the social network for Reason, writing that ""in fighting the alleged left-leaning political bias of the legacy social media platforms, Gab ran into the opposite problem."" He suggested that the website was only for those who ""subscribe to a certain radical subset of right-wing beliefs or are interested in seeing the feeds of those who do."" Nicholas Thompson of Wired questioned the sincerity of the site's claim to be a defender for ""free speech"" in October 2018, writing: ""To many people, Torba's First Amendment absolutism is just a talking point. The site exists less to defend the ideals of Benjamin Franklin than those of Christopher Cantwell. It chose as its logo a creature that looks rather like Pepe, the alt-right attack frog. It courted people on the far right, and it became a haven for them. Free speech can be less a principle than a smokescreen."" Thompson noted that Robert Bowers likely expected affirmation from his last message that indicated his intent to carry out the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre, leading Thompson to the conclusion: ""if it’s a platform where someone can expect affirmation for threatening slaughter, then why should anyone help it exist?""

Kelly Weill of The Daily Beast wrote in January 2019 that ""Gab has always been a bad website. Nothing loads, the search function is a joke, and its member rolls are riddled with porn bots. And that's even without the neo-Nazis posting racist memes and goading each other to murder.""

In February 2020, Tanya Basu of MIT Technology Review characterized Gab as being frequented by ""fringe far-right hate groups"".

Revenue
Gab does not use advertising, describing itself as an ""ad-free social network"". The site began offering a premium subscription service for Gab named ""GabPro"" in mid-March 2017. The subscription allowed users to have private chats for up to 25 people; private chat with a maximum of two users was later added for all users, and the GabPro limit was increased to 50. Private messages are deleted after 24 hours. GabPro subscribers can also view a topic breakdown for other users, make lists of users to sort their home feed, livestream on GabTV (though this has since been removed), and more easily get their profile verified. Subscribers also get a ""PRO"" badge next to their posts. In July 2017, Gab also started an investment project which met its goal of $1.07 million on August 19, 2017.

In February 2018, Gab announced that it had raised $4.8 million and was planning a $10 million Initial coin offering (ICO).

Gab has lost more than $350,000 from 2016 to 2018. The company relied on the online crowdfunding broker StartEngine starting in 2017, through which it raised $2 million. In April 2019, Gab announced that StartEngine had removed them from their platform and that they intended to sue StartEngine over unreturned fees.

Gab reported in a December 2018 filing that removal from PayPal and Stripe following the 2018 Pittsburgh Synagogue shooting had caused a 90% drop in its subscription revenue. It has since relied on mail and cryptocurrency for subscription payment processing; the company partnered with the ""obscure"" Second Amendment Processing for credit card payment processing in January 2019, but removed credit card payment options in March 2019. This removal came after an SPLC investigation published in early-March 2019 found Thomas Michael Troyer, founder of Second Amendment Processing, was convicted of financial crimes in 2007.

The company's Regulation A exempt offering of $10 million has been pending approval by the SEC since 2017. Two analysts contacted by the SPLC commented that this might suggest that ""the SEC has concerns about allowing the sale to go forward"". Heidi Beirich noted an unusual lack of communication records with the SEC regulators in Gab's financial filings, unlike those of similar companies. In a March 2019 SEC filing, Gab ""abruptly"" withdrew its request for stock sales, explaining that ""[the company] has decided to seek other capital raising alternatives."" Torba did not respond to SPLC inquiries regarding the withdrawal.

Design

Gab's color theme is a minimalist combination of black text on white panels with pink hashtags and usernames. Pro users have a contrasted top bar in dark blue. The interface displays messages in a Twitter-like vertical scroll timeline with an option to upvote each post. The site also aggregates popular posts and trending topic hashtags. Users of the site with a score higher than 250 can downvote posts, but must spend points to do so.

Users can sort comments and posts in a subject by time or score. Default biographies for new users display a randomly chosen quotation about the importance of free speech. Users also have the option to ""mute"" other users and terms. The default profile picture for new users to the site features NPC Wojak, a meme popular on far-right sites. The site offers its users an option to delete their entire posting history in a single click.

When writing a gab, users can post up to 3,000 characters of plain text, with the first 300 appearing in the timeline along with an option to read the rest.

In July 2017, Gab implemented a system where people who downvoted others (through spamming) would have their accounts downvoted as well and their ability to leave downvotes would be revoked. Downvotes were later removed entirely, with Gab's then-COO Utsav Sanduja explaining that they were being used to troll and to harass women, and that ""there were a lot of social justice warriors and members of the far left coming into our site essentially trying to start a brouhaha.""

A frog named ""Gabby"" was Gab's logo from 2016 to 2018. The logo has been compared to Pepe the Frog, a cartoon character appropriated by the alt-right. Torba denied that the frog logo was a reference to Pepe and stated that the logo was inspired by Bible verses (Exodus 8:1–12 and Psalms 78:45) and various other traditional symbolic meanings. Sanduja said that the frog was meant to symbolize the ""revenge against those who went against mainstream conservative voices on the internet."" As of September 2018, the frog logo is no longer used.

"Bill Wilkinson (baseball)

William Carl Wilkinson (born August 10, 1964) is an American former baseball pitcher. A left-handed pitcher, Wilkinson played for Major League Baseball's (MLB) Seattle Mariners in 1985, and from 1987 to 1988. During his career, he had a 5–8 record, 4.56 earned run average (ERA) and 103 strikeouts in 113⅓ innings pitched.

Family
Born in Greybull, Wyoming, Wilkinson is the great-grandson of Jim Bluejacket, a right-handed pitcher who spent three seasons in the Federal League and National League from 1914 to 1916. Bluejacket and Wilkinson are the only great-grandfather and great-grandson duo that have both played in MLB. Wilkinson's brother, Brian, was selected in the 1987 Major League Baseball draft by the Mariners.

Career
In the 1983 Major League Baseball draft, Wilkinson was selected in the fourth round by the Mariners, with the 87th overall pick. On June 13, 1985, he made his MLB debut with the Mariners, and took the loss against the Kansas City Royals after allowing four earned runs in five and two-thirds innings. Five days later, Wilkinson lost in his only other appearance during the 1985 season, which was also a start; he allowed five earned runs and recorded only one out. In his two major league starts, Wilkinson was 0–2 with a 13.50 earned run average. He was the fifth-youngest player in the American League in 1985. Following his start against the Rangers, the Mariners demoted him to the minor leagues.

Wilkinson did not pitch in the Major Leagues in 1986; he instead played for the Mariners' Triple-A affiliate, the Calgary Cannons of the Pacific Coast League. In 1985 and 1986, Wilkinson had a combined record of 13–9 while pitching for the Cannons. He appeared in 56 games as a reliever for Seattle in 1987, the most of any Mariners pitcher that year. He compiled a 3–4 record, with a 3.66 earned run average (ERA) and 10 saves. The following season, Wilkinson pitched in 30 games, and posted a 2–2 record with two saves and a career-low 3.48 ERA. However, he suffered an injury to his left shoulder. Before the 1989 season began, Wilkinson was sent back down to the minor leagues, where he was used as a starter. In April, the Mariners traded Wilkinson to the Pittsburgh Pirates as part of a five-player deal. Wilkinson never pitched for the Pirates, and did not return to MLB after 1988. His final minor league season was 1992, when he pitched for two teams in the Oakland Athletics organization, posting an 0–3 record and 8.21 ERA in 23 games.

"Carlsminde

Carlsminde is a Baroque-style mansion located at Søllerødvej 30  in Søllerød, Rudersdal Municipality, some 20 kilometres north of central Copenhagen, Denmark. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. The political party Venstre has been based in the building since 1971.

History
Carlsminde originates in an old tenant farm. Courty physician and kancelliråd Johan Peter Homuth constructed a small country house at the land in 1751 and later expanded the estate with more land twice. The current building was built for a later owner, Peter Wasserfalls, a grocer and manufacturer, probably a few years prior to his death in 1782. Wasserfall left the estate to his son who also purchased another nearby property. Carlsminde then changed hands many times. One of the later owners was prime minister Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow who wanted a summer residence close to Copenhagen.

The property was given the  Carlsminde by Bolette Rudolphine Berg (1761–1836) in memory of her late husband Carl Berg.  She also completed a 3.5 hectare park in English landscape style.

Carlsminde was owned by hunting master Rasmus Petersen from 1855 to 1867. During this period Carlsminde changed status from tenant farm to ownership. A later owner, Valet de chambre G. F. Bentzen, changed the facade in 1894.

Carlsminde was acquired by Isak Glückstadt in 1903. He expanded the estate from 10 to 25 hectares.  The park was expanded by the landscape architect Erstad Jørgensen . It was centred on  lake with pikes and tenches and was also home to two Indian elephants. In 1907 Glückstadt commissioned Carl Brummer to built a Norwegian-style cabin. It was moved to Rungsted in 1910 and to Holte in the early 1940s.

Dethlef Jürgensen owned Carlsminde from 1913 to 1947. He sold off most of the land, creating the streets Carlsmindevej and Carlsmindeparken. Jürgensen was a central figure at Klampenborg Racecourses. In 1913 he constructed the side wing with stables for nine horses.

A later owner, Erik Møller, a CEO, established a riding ground to the rear of the stables in the 1950s. Venstre acquired the property in 1970 and has been based there since 1971.

Architecture
The main building fronts a large courtyard located on the southside of Søllerødsvej. A detached side wing marks the east side of the courtyard.

The main building is 11 bays long and consists of a high cellar, bel étage and a hipped Mansard roof with blue-glazed tiles. The three-bay median risalit was adapted in the 1893. The two windows that flanked the main entrance were replaced by niches with sandstone vases. The Rococo-style Cartouche above the main entrance and the Neclassical attica was also added at this point. The combination of decorative elements from different architectural styles is a characteristic feature of the Historicist style that dominated Danish architecture in the 1890s.

The side wing contains two small apartments flanking a stable with room for nine horses. The northern gable of the side wing is integrated in the wall that partly surrounds the property.

Today
The secretariat of Venstre is based in the building. The garden is used for events on Constitution Day (5 June).

"MONECS

MONECS (Monash University Educational Computing System) was a computer operating system with BASIC, COBOL, FORTRAN, Pascal interpreters, plus machine language facility. Specifically designed for computer science education in Australian secondary schools and at the university undergraduate level. 
Alternative designations were DEAMON (Digital Equipment Australia - Monash University) or SCUBA (local designation at Melbourne University) systems.

Overview
For teaching computer science students in Australian schools Monash University created subsets of the FORTRAN language, an elementary version called MINITRAN then an enhanced version called MIDITRAN. MIDITRAN versions were available for a number of different mainframe systems, i.e. Burroughs B5000/B5500 series, CDC 3000, IBM 360 and ICL 1900. Student's programs were submitted on IBM Port-a-Punch cards that can be programmed with an IBM board and stylus or even a bent paper clip. Standard 80-column punch cards were an option for students if a card punch was available.

Before the minicomputer, it was impossible for a class of Australian students to have hands-on access to a computer within a one-hour school period. Mainframes were too expensive for small schools and remote job entry equipment was typically limited to major corporations, universities and research centres.

A group at Monash University under the leadership of Dr Len G. Whitehouse solved the problem with a small PDP-11 minicomputer system that could be used in the classroom. Mark sense cards were used, and a class of 30 children could each get two runs in a one-hour period. The Monash University series of Student FORTRAN predated and was an independent effort not associated with DEC's PDP-8 based EDUSYSTEM series which centred on the BASIC language.

MONECS was optimised for the low end hardware of the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11 minicomputer family. Typical installation would be a PDP-11/03, /04, /05 /10 or D. D. Webster Electronics' Spectrum-IIB (repackaged DEC LSI) processor with 32k Bytes memory.

MONECS systems were based on the PDP-11/05 or PDP-11/10 processors with core memory. This was identical hardware rebadged by the manufacturer DEC just to indicate an OEM version. Student systems were fitted with a custom UNIBUS interface to support the Memorex 651 flexible drive which was an early version of an 8-inch floppy disk.

Next major releases were the DEAMON systems based on PDP-11/04 or PDP/11/34 processors with semiconductor memory and DEC RX01 8-inch floppy disk drive(s). Then the LSI-11 systems based systems which moved away from the UNIBUS based processors and used the PDP-11/03 and Spectrum-IIB systems.

All systems were installed with a mark sense card reader PDI, Hewlett-Packard or Documation M-200, plus a 132 column lineprinter from Tally, DEC, etc.

Student programs were typically submitted as a deck of mark sense cards although punched cards were an option. Due to the 32k Byte memory constraint MONECS serially processed student programs with all jobs queued in the input hopper of the cardreader. The appropriate language interpreter was loaded from the floppy disk for each job and the results printed before reading in the next student's program.

The MONECS systems were supported by staff from the Monash University Computer Centre which was an entity independent from the Computer Science Department. The Computer Centre shared facilities and staff with the Victorian Hospitals Computing Service (HCS). The Computer Centre also processed mark-sense sheets on an ICL 1800 series reader for the Victorian Education Department's Secondary Students final (year 12) examinations.

A MONECS system at St Peter's Lutheran College was the first computer available for student use in a Queensland school.

Theatre projects

His projects fuse technology and multi-media across disciplines, with an immersive approach to theatre – incorporating sound design, organic approaches to lighting, design and movement. In 1999 his experiences with Welfare State International led him to create two large-scale site specific performances with boys at Birrong Boys High School – one of Sydney’s tougher schools. In his time at Shopfront he has directed CODA (2003) with residents of the Juvenile Justice system; How Sachi Lost His Leg (2004 -  a site specific spectacular combining puppetry and Capoeira); Wadya Call Me? (2004 – in a back lane, incorporating a 4 x 4m rolling screen, puppetry, live radio broadcast, and 19m graffiti wall created during the performance). In 2005, he directed Angels in the Architecture – creating an aerial urban ghetto and song cycle with an integrated ensemble of performers with and without disabilities. In 2006 he directed POP UP! an interactive three-dimensional multimedia pop up book, in and around the Shopfront complex. ""A City of Shadows and Ice"", was one of Shopfront's largest productions, being performed in August 2007 with the set made from ice and featuring Parkour artists.

"Norm McDonald (Australian footballer)

Norm McDonald (10 December 192528 November 2002), a Gunditjmara man, was an Australian rules footballer of Aboriginal heritage.

Football

Essendon (VFL)
McDonald played in the Essendon premiership teams in 1949 and 1950 and won the Essendon Best and Fairest award in 1951.

Golden Square (BFL)
In 1954, McDonald was cleared from Essendon, and was appointed captain-coach of the Golden Square Football Club in the Bendigo Football League, in place of ex-North Melbourne footballer Harry Green. McDonald left the club before the end of the 1954 season, and his position was filled for the remainder of the season by the team's full-back, Vin Lapsley. Footscray's (1954) premiership half-back flanker Alan Martin took over as Golden Square's captain-coach in 1955.

Athletics
A noted sprinter, McDonald ran second in the (Monday, 14 April 1952) final of the 1952 Stawell Gift to his Essendon Football Club teammate, Lance Mann; and, two days later (Wednesday, 14 April 1952) he, once again, ran second to Mann — in the final of the Bendigo Easter Gift.

The Easter Gift was an entirely different race from the Bendigo Thousand that had been conducted earlier that year from 8—10 March 1952: ""McDonald suffered a financial setback when he backed himself heavily to win the Bendigo Thousand and was beaten by 1ft. in his semi-final in time equal to 6yds., 2ft. inside evens — his best run of the season.""

McDonald also ran second to Mann in the 1952 Lilydale Backmarkers Handicap on 22 March 1952.
.

Death
He died on 28 November 2002 at the Footscray Hospital.

Indigenous Team of the Century
In 2005, McDonald was named on the half-back flank of the Indigenous Team of the Century.

Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll
In 2008 he was inducted into the Victorian Aboriginal Honour Roll.

"Michael B. Surbaugh

Michael B. Surbaugh was the 13th Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), having succeeded the retiring Wayne Brock on October 1, 2015.  He was previously Group Director of HR, Innovation, Exploring and Learning for Life for the BSA. Surbaugh first joined the organization as a professional scouter in 1983.

In November 2019, Surbaugh took a notable medical leave of absence.

On December 29, 2019, Surbaugh's retirement was announced via an email to BSA volunteers. He will be succeeded by Roger Mosby.

Background
Surbaugh earned his Eagle Scout award in Troop 360 in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania in 1976 and served on the summer camp staff of the Allegheny Trails Council, the predecessor of the Laurel Highlands Council. He is a graduate of Salem College in West Virginia.

Surbaugh has been met with criticism and praise for his changes in the BSA's admission policies. During his administration, the Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America has removed the ban against homosexual adult membership, changed the membership application to allow youth to include the gender they identify with instead of requiring the gender on their birth certificate, and has started accepting girls into the Cub Scout and Boy Scout (now renamed Scouts BSA) programs.

"Citrate synthase

The enzyme citrate synthase E.C. 2.3.3.1 (previously 4.1.3.7)] exists in nearly all living cells and stands as a pace-making enzyme in the first step of the citric acid cycle (or Krebs cycle). Citrate synthase is localized within eukaryotic cells in the mitochondrial matrix, but is encoded by nuclear DNA rather than mitochondrial. It is synthesized using cytoplasmic ribosomes, then transported into the mitochondrial matrix.
 
Citrate synthase is commonly used as a quantitative enzyme marker for the presence of intact mitochondria. Maximal activity of citrate synthase indicates the mitochondrial content of skeletal muscle. The maximal activity can be increased by endurance training or high-intensity interval training, but maximal activity is increased more with high-intensity interval training.

Citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation reaction of the two-carbon acetate residue from acetyl coenzyme A and a molecule of four-carbon oxaloacetate to form the six-carbon citrate:

 acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate + H2O → citrate + CoA-SH

Oxaloacetate is regenerated after the completion of one round of the Krebs cycle.

Oxaloacetate is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme. This induces the enzyme to change its conformation, and creates a binding site for the acetyl-CoA. Only when this citroyl-CoA has formed will another conformational change cause thioester hydrolysis and release coenzyme A. This ensures that the energy released from the thioester bond cleavage will drive the condensation.

Structure 

Citrate synthase's 437 amino acid residues are organized into two main subunits, each consisting of 20 alpha-helices.  These alpha helices compose approximately 75% of citrate synthase's tertiary structure, while the remaining residues mainly compose irregular extensions of the structure, save a single beta-sheet of 13 residues.  Between these two subunits,  a single cleft exists containing the active site.  Two binding sites can be found therein: one reserved for citrate or oxaloacetate and the other for Coenzyme A.  The active site contains three key residues: His274, His320, and Asp375 that are highly selective in their interactions with substrates.
The adjacent images display the tertiary structure of citrate synthase in its opened and closed form.  The enzyme changes from opened to closed with the addition of one of its substrates (such as oxaloacetate).

Function

Mechanism 

Citrate synthase has three key amino acids in its active site (known as the catalytic triad) which catalyze the conversion of acetyl-CoA [H3CC(=O)−SCoA] and oxaloacetate [−O2CCH2C(=O)CO2−] into citrate [−O2CCH2C(OH)(CO2−)CH2CO2−] and H−SCoA in an aldol condensation reaction.  This conversion begins with the negatively charged carboxylate side chain oxygen atom of Asp-375 deprotonating acetyl CoA’s alpha carbon atom to form an enolate anion which in turn is neutralized by protonation by His-274 to form an enol intermediate [H2C=C(OH)−SCoA]. At this point, the epsilon nitrogen lone pair of electrons on His-274 formed in the last step abstracts the hydroxyl enol proton to reform an enolate anion that initiates a nucleophilic attack on the oxaloacetate’s carbonyl carbon [−O2CCH2C(=O)CO2−] which in turn deprotonate the epsilon nitrogen atom of His-320.  This nucleophilic addition results in the formation of citroyl−CoA [−O2CCH2CH(CO2−)CH2C(=O)−SCoA].  At this point, a water molecule is deprotonated by the epsilon nitrogen atom of His-320 and hydrolysis is initiated.  One of the oxygen’s lone pairs nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon of citroyl−CoA.  This forms a tetrahedral intermediate and results in the ejection of −SCoA as the carbonyl reforms.  The −SCoA is protonated to form HSCoA.  Finally, the hydroxyl added to the carbonyl in the previous step is deprotonated and citrate [−O2CCH2C(OH)(CO2−)CH2CO2−] is formed.

Inhibition 

The enzyme is inhibited by high ratios of ATP:ADP and NADH:NAD, as high concentrations of ATP and NADH show that the energy supply is high for the cell.  It is also inhibited by succinyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, which resembles Acetyl-coA and acts as a competitive inhibitor to acetyl-CoA and a noncompetitive inhibitor to oxaloacetate. Citrate inhibits the reaction and is an example of product inhibition.
The inhibition of citrate synthase by acetyl-CoA analogues has also been well documented and has been used to prove the existence of a single active site.  These experiments have revealed that this single site alternates between two forms, which participate in ligase and hydrolase activity respectively.  This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation.

"John Hayward (Newfoundland politician)

John Hayward (1819 – March 13, 1885) was a lawyer, judge and politician in Newfoundland. He served in the Newfoundland House of Assembly from 1852 to 1866.

He was born and educated in Harbour Grace. He studied law with George Henry Emerson and was called to the Newfoundland bar in 1841. He served as chief clerk and registrar for the northern circuit court and as sub-collector of customs at Harbour Grace.

In 1849, John and his young family headed for Washington County in Wisconsin. They traveled during a week and a half. They took a boat from Newfoundland to New York, then up the canals to Albany, another boat to Buffalo. They traveled to Wisconsin by wagon and bought a farm and had land cleared. After a few months, in a letter to his father-in-law, he seems full of optimism. In spite of that, he was back in Harbour Grace at the end of 1850, and was sub-collector of Customs in 1851.

He was elected to the assembly for Conception Bay in 1852 and for Harbour Grace in 1855 and again in 1859. He served as Solicitor General in the provincial cabinet until 1861. The results of the 1861 election in Harbour Grace were set aside due to violence at the polls; Hayward was re-elected in a by-election held later that year. He was elected again in 1865 and was named Solicitor General again. Hayward was opposed to the union with Canada proposed in 1866. He retired from politics in August of that year and was named an assistant justice in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland. Hayward retired from the bench due to illness in 1884 and died the following year.

"Phantom X1

The Phantom X1 is a single-engined, tractor configuration, single seat, cable-braced high wing tricycle gear-equipped ultralight aircraft that is produced by Phantom Aeronautics of Three Rivers, Michigan and available in kit form.

The X1 design was intended to have an empty weight under  to fit into the FAR Part 103 ultralight category. There is also an X2 two seater which was designed as an ultralight trainer. Modernized models of the single and two-seaters use struts in place of the original cable-bracing.

Design and development
The Phantom X1 was introduced at Sun 'n Fun in 1982, where it attracted a great deal of attention and won a major design award. The design was produced by a number of different manufacturers, including Phantom Aircraft of Kalamazoo, Michigan and has been widely copied. Derivative designs include the Bell Sidewinder, Hy-Tek Hurricane 103, Worldwide Ultralite Spitfire and the Golden Gate Mosquito.

The Phantom X1 is constructed from bolted-together aluminum tubing. The wings and tail surfaces are covered in Dacron sailcloth in the form of pre-sewn envelopes. The wings are wire-braced from an inverted ""V"" shaped kingpost and feature full-span ailerons. There was also a factory option offered to allow the wings to fold for transport and storage.  The engine is mounted on the front of the main tube, the tail being mounted on the far end of the same tube. The cockpit pod is made from fiberglass. The landing gear includes a steerable nosewheel.

The X1 was originally designed as an aerobatic aircraft and was tested to +9/-6.6 g before failure and carries operational limits of +6.6/-4.4 g. The full-span ailerons also give the X1 a fast roll-rate. For liability reasons the X1 was never marketed as an aerobatic design.

Factory options included brakes and a complete airframe parachute along with a variety of Rotax engines from . Original assembly time was rated by the manufacturer as 40 hours.

Variants

"James Durbin (singer)

James William Durbin (born January 6, 1989) is an American singer and guitarist from Santa Cruz, California, who finished in fourth place on the tenth season of American Idol. Durbin was the lead singer for Quiet Riot from 2017 to 2019.

Early life
Durbin was born in 1989 to Judy Settle-Durbin, a dentist's daughter, and Willy Durbin, a bass player, who died of a heroin overdose when James was nine. He announced during his aired audition on American Idol that he was upset he didn't have the chance to know his father well. He was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and Asperger syndrome shortly after his father died. He attended Musicschool, a music school run by Dale Ockerman in Santa Cruz instead of a traditional school.  Durbin never graduated from high school. Durbin cites popular bands My Chemical Romance and Thirty Seconds to Mars as his inspirations for his music.

In 2006, he performed in a Santa Cruz children's theater group called Kids on Broadway and played the lead role in Grease and Beauty and the Beast. In 2007, he played the leading roles of Tony in West Side Story and Oscar in Sweet Charity—both productions produced by All About Theatre, a Santa Cruz community theatre company. In 2008, Durbin appeared in Alan Parsons' ""Art & Science of Sound Recording"" educational video series, recording a version of Parsons' ""We Play The Game"" at Ex'pression College for Digital Arts.

He was the lead singer in a band called Hollywood Scars, where he went by the stage name of Jimmy Levox. Influenced by bands such as Metallica, Pantera, Judas Priest, Dream Theater, Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden and Mötley Crüe, Hollywood Scars drew their inspiration from the glitz, glam, and decadence of Hollywood's Sunset Strip in the 1980s. The band released a single entitled ""Under The Cherry Tree"". He was also in a band called Whatever Fits. He has also sung country music.

Career

American Idol
Durbin had previously auditioned for American Idol in the eighth season, but was not chosen.

Durbin was eliminated in the Top 4 on the tenth season, but despite his elimination, he received a homecoming previously reserved for Top 3 contestants, the first time such an exception on the homecoming policy was made by the show.  Footage of his homecoming, dubbed the ""Durbin Day"", was shown briefly on the Top 3 performance show.

He appeared on the American Idol tenth season finale, singing ""Livin' After Midnight"" and ""Breaking the Law"" with Judas Priest.

Performances and results

 Due to the judges using their one save to save Casey Abrams, the Top 11 remained intact for another week, when two contestants were eliminated.

Post-Idol
After his elimination Durbin appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,
Live with Regis and Kelly, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and The Ellen DeGeneres Show.  Along with the rest of the Top 11 finalists, he participated in the American Idol Tour that season.

On May 28, 2011, Durbin and the other American Idol top 4 performed at the opening of the new Microsoft Store at Lenox Square Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.

"Nicolas Sidjakov

Nicolas Sidjakov (December 16, 1924 – June 20, 1993) was a Latvian-born Russian American commercial artist and illustrator.

Biography 
Sidjakov was born in Riga, Latvia. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, worked in advertising, and freelanced for the French movie industry.  In 1954 he moved to the United States and continued to work in advertising. He also began to illustrate children's books, mainly picture books, beginning with The Friendly Beasts by Laura Nelson Baker, adapted from ""The Friendly Beasts"", an English Christmas carol. It was published in 1957 by Parnassus Press of Berkeley, California. 

Parnassus was a small press established only that year by Herman Schein, whose wife Ruth Robbins was a writer and illustrator. During the next several years it published at least three picture books created by Robbins, as writer, and Sidjakov. The first was Baboushka and the Three Kings, retelling the ""Russian folktale about an old woman's endless search for the Christ child"". For that work he received the annual Caldecott Medal from the American Library Association in 1961, as illustrator of the previous year's ""most distinguished American picture book for children"".

From 1945 to the 1970s, San Francisco was a hub of creativity and Nicolas was in the thick of it. He designed more than he illustrated and there were many accolades for him in the advertising annuals of the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1978 he and Jerry Berman formed the design firm of Sidjakov & Berman Associates, then Sidjakov, Berman & Gomez in 1981.  In 1987 the company became part of the British-owned WPP Group plc and is now known as Enterprise IG, San Francisco.

Sidjakov was a resident of Sausalito, Marin County, California, when he died in 1993.

 The Friendly Beasts, written by Laura Nelson Baker (Berkeley, CA: Parnassus Press, 1959) – adapted from ""The Friendly Beasts"",

"Manifesto (Roxy Music album)

Manifesto is the sixth studio album by the English rock band Roxy Music. It was released in March 1979 by E.G. in the UK, Polydor in Europe and by Atco Records in the US.

Following an almost four-year recording hiatus, Manifesto was Roxy Music's first studio album since 1975's Siren. The first single from Manifesto was ""Trash"", which barely made the UK top 40. However, the second single, the disco-tinged ""Dance Away"", peaked at no.2, beaten to no.1 for three weeks from 26 May 1979 by Blondie's ""Sunday Girl"". Regardless, it became one of the band's biggest hits and was also the 9th best-selling single in the UK in 1979. The song was also released as a 12"" extended version (running at six and half minutes), a format that had started to become popular in the late 1970s. The third single from the album was a re-recorded version of ""Angel Eyes"", which was far more electronic and ""disco"" in nature than the power-pop album version. An extended 12"" mix was also released. The single also made the UK Top 5 in August.

The album itself peaked at no. 7 in the UK. The cover design which featured a variety of mannequins (a concept also used for the covers of the singles from the album), was created by Bryan Ferry with fashion designer Antony Price and American TV actress Hilary Thompson amongst others. The picture disc version of the album featured a version of the design in which the mannequins are unclothed. The cover's typography, as well as the album's title, were inspired by the first edition of Wyndham Lewis's literary magazine Blast.

Release history 
On the original vinyl release, side one was labelled ""East Side"" and side two was labelled ""West Side"".

After the song became a hit, the second pressings of the album substituted the original version of ""Dance Away"" with its single remix. Later on, the LP version of ""Angel Eyes"" was also replaced by the more popular re-recorded version released as a single. The original CD versions of the album used the revised track list, until the LP version of ""Angel Eyes"" was restored in the 1999 remaster. Manifesto was finally released on CD in its original version on The Complete Studio Recordings box in 2012. The LP versions of both songs first appeared on CD in 1995 on The Thrill of It All box set.

Critical reception 

Manifesto was positively received by critics but not as well regarded as previous Roxy Music albums. Melody Maker review of the album stated 

Max Bell of NME gave it a lukewarm review: 

Similarly, Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote: ""This isn't Roxy at its most innovative, just its most listenable – the entire ""West Side"" sustains the relaxed, pleasantly funky groove it intends, and the difficulties of the ""East Side"" are hardly prohibitive. At last Ferry's vision seems firsthand even in its distancing – he's paid enough dues to deserve to keep his distance. And the title track is well-named, apparent contradictions and all."" 

Greil Marcus wrote in Rolling Stone: 

It was ranked 30th in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll of the best albums of 1979. The 1992 Rolling Stone Album Guide gave the album four stars and says ""the regrouped Roxy seems better for the rest: deftly blending fresh rhythms into its signature sound, shortening the musical passages and concentrating more on song craft.

"Nanjing–Qidong railway

The Nanjing–Qidong railway (), commonly referred to in short as the Ningqi railway (), is a railway in the Chinese province of Jiangsu.  Its common name is derived from Ning, the one-character abbreviation for Nanjing and Qi, which refers to Qidong, a county-level city of Nantong. Despite its name, the railway currently runs as far as east as Nantong East railway station, and does not extend into Qidong itself, although this remaining section is under construction. At its present state, the railway is  in length. It runs along the northern bank of the Yangtze River, serving cities such as Yangzhou, Taizhou, and Hai'an. Passenger service is currently operated between Nanjing railway station and Nantong railway station only.

History
Planning for a railway along the north bank of the Yangtze River began as early as 1958.  In 1977, the government of Jiangsu province designated the railway from Nanjing to Nantong as a project for completion within the next 10 years.  Due to funding shortage and disagreement over route, the project was not built for 20 years.  The project was revived in the late 1990s with the onset of construction on the Xinyi–Changxing railway, which was the first railway to be built in Jiangsu province north of the Yangtze River.  In 2001, the Ministry of Railways approved plans for the Ningqi railway, and construction was built in two phases.  The Nanjing to Hai'an section was built from March 1, 2002 to December 2003.  The Haian to Yangzhou and Nantong sections were  completed by July 2005.

A major upgrade project on the Nanjing–Qidong railway was completed in December 20, 2015. This involved the electrification of the railway line and building a second track. This was expected to halve the travel time from Nantong to Nanjing from the previous 3 hours 50 min to 1 hour 50 min. EMU trains entered trial operation on May 6, 2016 and started revenue service from May 15, 2016.
 
Plans were approved in 2012 for a cross-river connection from Nantong to the Shanghai metropolitan area (the Shanghai–Nantong railway). It will connect to the Nanjing–Qidong railway at Pingdong station () on the northwestern outskirts of Nantong's urban core. Construction work on the Hutong Yangtze River bridge started on March 1, 2014. The line is expected to open at the end of 2018.

"Sekaten

Sekaten (originated from Arabic word: Syahadatain) is a week-long Javanese traditional ceremony, festival, fair and pasar malam (night market) commemorating Maulid (the birthday of prophet Muhammad), celebrated annually started on 5th day through the 12th day of (Javanese Calendar) Mulud month (corresponding to Rabi' al-awwal in Islamic Calendar).

The festivities usually took place in northern alun-alun (square) in Yogyakarta, and simultaneously also celebrated in northern alun-alun of Surakarta. This ceremony originally were initiated by Sultan Hamengkubuwana I, the founder of Yogyakarta Sultanate to promote the Islamic faith.

Gamelan Sekaten 

On day one, the ceremony commences after the Isya evening prayer with a royal procession of royal guards and 'abdi dalem' court officials accompanying two sets of centuries old gamelan traditional music instruments, the Kyai Nogo Wilogo and Kyai Guntur Madu.  The royal procession, led by the Sultan and Governor of Yogyakarta or his representative, begins in Pendopo Ponconiti, the main hall of Kraton Yogyakarta and proceeds towards Yogyakarta Great Mosque in northern Alun-Alun. The Kyai Nogo Wilogo gamelan will be placed at the northern pavilion of Grand Mosque, while Gamelan Kyai Guntur Madu will be placed at Pagongan pavilion in southern side of the mosque. These two set of sacred gamelans will be played simultaneously everyday until the 11th day of Maulud month through seven consecutive days. During the last day the two gamelans will be returned into the Kraton.

The Gamelan Sekaten of Surakarta are played in the same manner as their Yogyakarta counterparts, and are brought out to the mosque and returned to the palace in a royal procession led by the Sunan of Surakarta and the Mayor and City Council of Surakarta.

Tumplak Wajik 
Two days before Grebeg Muludan, the ceremony called Tumplak Wajik was held in palace Magangan field in 4:00 PM afternoon. This ceremony is started by kotekan ceremony which incorporate singing traditional songs accompanied with rhythmic hitting of kentongan (bamboo or wooden slit drum) and lumpang (rice mortar and pestle), that marked the making of Gunungan which will be carried in Grebeg Mulud festival. The traditional Javanese kue called wajik which is diamond-shaped sticky rice in palm sugar, is an essential part of this ceremony, and included within gunungan offering. The song played in this Tumplak Wajik ceremony is usually the popular Javanese traditional songs, such as Lompong Keli, Tundhung Setan, Owal awil.

Grebeg Muludan 
In Yogyakarta, the main event of Sekaten is called the Grebeg Muludan that held in 12th day (exactly during the birthday of Prophet Muhammad) starting in 8:00 am. The main Gunungan (Javanese: mountain), a model of mountain made of sticky rice, sweets, various foods, crackers, fruits and vegetables, were guarded by 10 units of bregodo (brigade) of the royal guards of the palace (the companies under His Majesty's Kraton Guard Regiment): Wirobrojo, Daeng, Patangpuluh, Jogokaryo, Prawirotomo, Nyutro, Ketanggung, Mantrijero, Surokarso, and Bugis Companies, together with the Royal Guard Battalion of the Duchy of Pakualaman.

The Gunungan will be  carried in processions from Kemandungan through Sitihinggil and Pagelaran hall and finally ended in Grand Mosque. After the prayer, the Gunungan that symbolize the wealth and prosperity of Mataram Sultanate will be picked, fought over and ripped apart by the people that already waiting in the square, as they believed this objects is sacred, potent and could bring good luck, prosperity and wealth upon their households. Usually these parts of Gunungan will be kept in the house for luck, or buried in the rice fields as the traditional Javanese farmers believed that these objects will grant their fields fertility and protection from locust, plagues, and any misfortunes that might befell them.

"1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine

The 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, later came to be known as ""The Great Revolt"", was a nationalist uprising by Palestinian Arabs in Mandatory Palestine against the British administration of the Palestine Mandate, demanding Arab independence and the end of the policy of open-ended Jewish immigration and land purchases with the stated goal of establishing a ""Jewish National Home"". The dissent was directly influenced by the Qassamite rebellion, following the killing of Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam in 1935, as well as the declaration by Hajj Amin al-Husseini of 16 May 1936 as 'Palestine Day' and calling for a General Strike. The revolt was branded by many in the Jewish Yishuv as ""immoral and terroristic"", often comparing it to fascism and nazism. Ben Gurion however described Arab causes as fear of growing Jewish economic power, opposition to mass Jewish immigration and fear of the English identification with Zionism.

The general strike lasted from April to October 1936, initiating the violent revolt. The revolt consisted of two distinct phases. The first phase was directed primarily by the urban and elitist Higher Arab Committee (HAC) and was focused mainly on strikes and other forms of political protest. By October 1936, this phase had been defeated by the British civil administration using a combination of political concessions, international diplomacy (involving the rulers of Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Transjordan and Yemen) and the threat of martial law. The second phase, which began late in 1937, was a violent and peasant-led resistance movement provoked by British repression in 1936 that increasingly targeted British forces. During this phase, the rebellion was brutally suppressed by the British Army and the Palestine Police Force using repressive measures that were intended to intimidate the Arab population and undermine popular support for the revolt. During this phase, a more dominant role on the Arab side was taken by the Nashashibi clan, whose NDP party quickly withdrew from the rebel Arab Higher Committee, led by the radical faction of Amin al-Husseini, and instead sided with the British – dispatching ""Fasail al-Salam"" (the ""Peace Bands"") in coordination with the British Army against nationalist and Jihadist Arab ""Fasail"" units (literally ""bands"").

According to official British figures covering the whole revolt, the army and police killed more than 2,000 Arabs in combat, 108 were hanged, and 961 died because of what they described as ""gang and terrorist activities"". In an analysis of the British statistics, Walid Khalidi estimates 19,792 casualties for the Arabs, with 5,032 dead: 3,832 killed by the British and 1,200 dead because of ""terrorism"", and 14,760 wounded. Over ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population between 20 and 60 was killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled. Estimates of the number of Palestinian Jews killed range from 91 to several hundred.

The Arab revolt in Mandatory Palestine was unsuccessful, and its consequences affected the outcome of the 1948 Palestine war. It caused the British Mandate to give crucial support to pre-state Zionist militias like the Haganah, whereas on the Palestinian Arab side, the revolt forced the flight into exile of the main Palestinian Arab leader of the period, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem – Haj Amin al-Husseini.

Origins

In 1930 Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam organized and established the Black Hand, an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organization. He recruited and arranged military training for peasants and by 1935 he had enlisted between 200 and 800 men. They were engaged in a campaign of vandalizing trees planted by farmers and British-constructed rail lines. In November 1935, two of his men engaged in a firefight with the Palestine Police patrol hunting fruit thieves and a policeman was killed. Following the incident, the police launched a manhunt and surrounded al-Qassam in a cave near Ya'bad. In the ensuing battle, al-Qassam was killed.

The death of al-Qassam generated widespread outrage among Palestinian Arabs. Huge crowds accompanied Qassam's body to his grave in Haifa.

The dissent in Palestine was influenced also by the discovery in October 1935 at the port of Jaffa of a large arms shipment destined for the Haganah, sparking Arab fears of a Jewish military takeover of Palestine, Jewish immigration also peaked in 1935, just months before Palestinian Arabs began a full-scale, nationwide revolt. In the four years between 1933 and 1936
more than 164,000 Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine, and between 1931 and 1936 the Jewish population more than doubled from 175,000 to 370,000 people, increasing the Jewish population share from 17% to 27%, and bringing about a significant deterioration in relations between Palestinian Arabs and Jews.

The uprising began with the 1936 Anabta shooting, a 15 April 1936 roadblock that stopped a convoy of trucks on the Nablus to Tulkarm road during which the (probably Qassamite) assailants shot two Jewish drivers, Israel Khazan, who was killed instantly, and Zvi Dannenberg, who died five days later. The next day members of the militant Jewish faction, the Irgun, shot and killed two Arab workers sleeping in a hut near Petah Tikva in a revenge attack.  Then the funeral for Khazan in Tel Aviv on 17 April attracted a huge crowd, and some Jews beat up Arab bystanders and destroyed property. This was followed by the Bloody Day in Jaffa, in which an Arab mob rampaged through a residential area killing Jews and destroying property. An Arab general strike and revolt ensued that lasted until October 1936.

During the summer of that year, thousands of Jewish-farmed acres and orchards were destroyed, Jewish civilians were attacked and murdered, and some Jewish communities, such as those in Beisan and Acre, fled to safer areas.

Economic background

Economic factors played a major role in the outbreak of the Arab revolt. Palestine's fellahin, the country's peasant farmers, comprised over two-thirds of the indigenous Arab population and from the 1920s onwards they were pushed off the land in increasingly large numbers into urban environments where they often encountered only poverty and social marginalisation. Many were crowded into shanty towns in Jaffa and Haifa where they found succor and encouragement in the teachings of the charismatic preacher Izz ad-Din al-Qassam who worked among the poor in Haifa. The revolt was thus a popular uprising that produced its own leaders and developed into a national revolt.

World War I left Palestine, especially the countryside, deeply impoverished. The Ottoman and then the Mandate authorities levied high taxes on farming and agricultural produce and during the 1920s and 1930s this together with a fall in prices, cheap imports, natural disasters and paltry harvests all contributed to the increasing indebtedness of the fellahin. The rents paid by tenant fellah increased sharply, owing to increased population density, and transfer of land from Arabs to the Jewish settlement agencies, such as the Jewish National Fund, increased the number of fellahin evicted while also removing the land as a future source of livelihood. By 1931 the 106,400 dunums of low-lying Category A farming land in Arab possession supported a farming population of 590,000 whereas the 102,000 dunums of such land in Jewish possession supported a farming population of only 50,000. The problem of 'landless' Arabs grew particularly grave after 1931, causing High Commissioner Wauchope to warn that this 'social peril ... would serve as a focus of discontent and might even result in serious disorders.'

Although the Mandatory government introduced measures to limit the transfer of land from Arabs to Jews these were easily circumvented by willing buyers and sellers. The failure of the authorities to invest in economic growth and healthcare and the Zionist policy of ensuring that their investments were directed only to facilitate expansion of the Yishuv further compounded matters. The government did, however, set the minimum wage for Arab workers below that for Jewish workers, which meant that those making capital investments in the Yishuv's economic infrastructure, such as Haifa's electricity plant, the Shemen oil and soap factory, the Grands Moulins flour mills and the Nesher cement factory, could take advantage of cheap Arab labour pouring in from the countryside. After 1935 the slump in the construction boom and further concentration by the Yishuv on an exclusivist Hebrew labour programme removed most of the sources of employment for rural migrants. By 1935 only 12,000 Arabs (5% of the workforce) worked in the Jewish sector, half of these in agriculture, whereas 32,000 worked for the Mandate authorities and 211,000 were either self-employed or worked for Arab employers.

The ongoing disruption of agrarian life in Palestine, which had been continuing since Ottoman times, thus created a large population of landless peasant farmers who subsequently became mobile wage workers who were increasingly marginalised and impoverished; these became willing participants in nationalist rebellion.

Political and socio-cultural background

Initially, the conflict with Zionism helped to make Palestinian Arab society more conservative in cultural, social, religious and political affairs because people were highly motivated to preserve their distinct heritage and identity against the dual impact of British colonialism and Jewish innovation. Traditionally, the Arabs had an elite, but not a real leadership. Both of these things changed over the course of the 1930s. During this period new political organizations and new types of activist began to appear, marking the involvement of a far broader cross-section of the population; in particular, nationalism, which had been long-rooted in rural society began to take hold in urban society.

Youth organisations proliferated at this time; these included the Young Men's Muslim Association, which from 1931 agitated for armed resistance against the Zionists, the Youth Congress Party, which expressed pan-Arab sentiments, and the Palestinian Boy Scout Movement, founded early in 1936, which became active in the general strike.

Women's organisations, which had been active in social matters, became politically involved from the end of the 1920s, with an Arab Women's Congress held in Jerusalem in 1929 attracting 200 participants, and an Arab Women's Association (later Arab Women's Union) being established at the same time, both organised by feminist Tarab Abdul Hadi.

From the beginning of the 1930s new political parties began to appear, including the Independence Party, which called for an Indian Congress Party-style boycott of the British, the pro-Nashashibi National Defence Party, the pro-Husayni Palestinian Arab Party the pro-Khalidi Arab-Palestinian Reform Party, and the National Bloc, based mainly around Nablus.

A few militant secret societies, which advocated armed struggle were formed; these included the Green Hand, which was active in the hills around Safad, but eliminated by the British in 1931, the Organization for Holy Struggle, led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and active in the Hebron area, which was later to play an important role in the 1948 Palestine War, and the Young Rebels or Avenging Youth, active in the Tulkarm and Qalqilyah area from 1935.

Traditional feasts such as Nebi Musa began to acquire a political and nationalist dimension and new national memorial days were introduced or gained new significance; among them Balfour Day (2 November, marking the Balfour Declaration of 1917), the anniversary of the Battle of Hattin (4 July, marking Saladin's recapture of Jerusalem), and beginning in 1930 May 16 was celebrated as Palestine Day.

The expansion of education, the development of civil society and of transportation, communications, and especially of broadcasting and other media, all facilitated these changes.

Regional political background
A number of political changes in neighbouring Arab countries illustrated to the Palestinian Arabs what could be achieved in a Western colony through political pressure and negotiating skill.

In Syria a general strike took place from 20 January to 6 March 1936 spreading to all the major towns, and political demonstrations held throughout the country gave fresh momentum to the Syrian national movement. Although French reprisals were harsh the government agreed on 2 March to the formation of a Syrian delegation to travel to Paris to negotiate a Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence. This demonstrated that determined economic and political pressure could challenge a fragile imperial administration.

In Egypt on 2 March 1936 a series of formal negotiations between the United Kingdom and Egypt began leading to the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which granted independence to Egypt, but allowed the British to keep forces in the Suez Canal Zone.

In Iraq a general strike in July 1931, accompanied by organised demonstrations in the streets, led to independence for the former British mandate territory under prime minister Nuri as-Said, and full membership of the League of Nations in October 1932.

Timeline

Arab General Strike and armed insurrection

The strike began on 19 April in Nablus, where an Arab National Committee was formed, and by the end of the month National Committees had been formed in all of the towns and some of the larger villages. On 21 April the leaders of the five main parties accepted the decision at Nablus and called for a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping for the following day.

While the strike was initially organised by workers and local committees, under pressure from below, political leaders became involved to help with co-ordination. This led to the formation on 25 April 1936 of the Arab Higher Committee (AHC). The Committee resolved ""to continue the general strike until the British Government changes its present policy in a fundamental manner""; the demands were threefold: (1) the prohibition of Jewish immigration; (2) the prohibition of the transfer of Arab land to Jews; (3) the establishment of a National Government responsible to a representative council.

About one month after the general strike started, the leadership group declared a general non-payment of taxes in explicit opposition to Jewish immigration.

In the countryside, armed insurrection started sporadically, becoming more organised with time. One particular target of the rebels was the Mosul–Haifa oil pipeline of the Iraq Petroleum Company constructed only a few years earlier to Haifa from a point on the Jordan River south of Lake Tiberias. This was repeatedly bombed at various points along its length. Other attacks were on railways (including trains) and on civilian targets such as Jewish settlements, secluded Jewish neighbourhoods in the mixed cities, and Jews, both individually and in groups.

The measures taken against the strike were harsh at the beginning and grew harsher as it went along involving house searches without warrants, night raids, preventive detention, caning, flogging, deportation, confiscation of property, and torture.  As early as May 1936 the British formed armed Jewish units equipped with armoured vehicles to serve as auxiliary police.

The British government in Palestine was convinced that the strike had the full support of the Palestinian Arabs and they could see ""no weakening in the will and spirit of the Arab people.""  Air Vice-Marshall Richard Peirse, commander of British forces in Palestine and Transjordan from 1933 to 1936, reported that because the rebel armed bands were supported by villagers,

It was quickly evident that the only way to regain the initiative from the rebels was by initiating measures against the villagers from which the rebels and saboteurs came ... I therefore initiated, in co-operation with the Inspector-General of Police R. G. B. Spicer, village searches. Ostensibly, these searches were undertaken to find arms and wanted persons, actually the measures adopted by the Police on the lines of similar Turkish methods, were punitive and effective.
In reality the measures created a sense of solidarity between the villagers and the rebels. The pro-Government Mayor of Nablus complained to the High Commissioner that, ""During the last searches effected in villages properties were destroyed, jewels stolen, and the Holy Qur'an torn, and this has increased the excitement of the fellahin."" However, Moshe Shertok of the Jewish Agency even suggested that all villages in the area of an incident should be punished.

On 2 June, an attempt by rebels to derail a train bringing the 2nd Battalion Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment from Egypt led to the railways being put under guard, placing a great strain on the security forces. In response to this situation on 4 June the government rounded up a large number of Palestinian leaders and sent them to a detention camp at Auja al-Hafir in the Negev desert.

The Battle of Nur Shams on 21 June marked an escalation with the largest engagement of British troops against Arab militants so far in this Revolt.

During July, Arab volunteers from Syria and Transjordan, led by Fawzi al-Qawukji, helped the rebels to divide their formations into four fronts, each led by a District Commander who had armed platoons of 150–200 fighters, each commanded by a platoon leader.

A Statement of Policy issued by the Colonial Office in London on 7 September declared the situation a: ""direct challenge to the authority of the British Government in Palestine"" and announced the appointment of Lieutenant-General John Dill as supreme military commander. By the end of September  British troops in Palestine were deployed to ""round up Arab bands"".

In June 1936 the British involved their clients in Transjordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Egypt in an attempt to pacify the Palestinian Arabs and on 9 October the rulers made an appeal for the strike to be ended. A more pressing concern may have been the approaching citrus harvest and the soaring prices that were available because of the disruption caused to the Spanish citrus harvest by the Spanish Civil War.

Peel commission
The strike was called off on 11 October 1936 and the violence abated for about a year while the Peel Commission deliberated. The Royal Commission was announced on 18 May 1936 and its members were appointed on 29 July, but the Commission did not arrive in Palestine until 11 November.

The Commission, which concluded that 1,000 Arab rebels had been killed during the strike, later described the disturbances as ""an open rebellion of the Palestinian Arabs, assisted by fellow-Arabs from other countries, against Mandatory rule"" and noted two unprecedented features of the revolt: the support of all senior Arab officials in the political and technical departments in the Palestine administration (including all of the Arab judges) and the ""interest and sympathy of the neighbouring Arab peoples"", which had resulted in support for the rebellion in the form of volunteers from Syria and Iraq.

In the early 1920s the first High Commissioner of Palestine, Herbert Samuel, failed to create a unified political structure embracing both Palestinian Arabs and Palestinian Jews in constitutional government with joint political institutions. This failure facilitated internal institutional partition in which the Jewish Agency exercised a degree of autonomous control over the Jewish settlement and the Supreme Muslim Council performed a comparable role for Muslims. Thus, well before Lord Peel arrived in Palestine on 11 November 1936, the groundwork for territorial partition as proposed by the Royal Commission in its report on 7 July 1937 had already been done.

Peel's main recommendation was for partition of Palestine into a small Jewish state (based on current Jewish land ownership population and incorporating the country's most productive agricultural land), a residual Mandatory area, and a larger Arab state linked to Transjordan. A second and more radical proposal was for transfer of 225,000 Palestinian Arabs from the Jewish state to the Arab state and Transjordan. It is likely that Zionist leaders played a role in persuading Peel to accept the notion of transfer, which had been a strand of Zionist ideology from its inception.

The Arab Higher Committee rejected the recommendations immediately, as did the Jewish Revisionists. Initially, the religious Zionists, some of the General Zionists, and sections of the Labour Zionist movement opposed the recommendations. Ben-Gurion was delighted by the Peel Commission's support for transfer, which he viewed as the foundation of ""national consolidation in a free homeland."" Subsequently, the 2 main Jewish leaders, Chaim Weizmann and Ben Gurion had convinced the Zionist Congress to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiation, and to negotiate a modified Peel proposal with the British.

The British government initially accepted the Peel report in principle. However, with war clouds looming over Europe, they realized that to attempt to implement it against the will of the Palestinian Arab majority would rouse up the entire Arab world against Britain. The Woodhead Commission considered three different plans, one of which was based on the Peel plan. Reporting in 1938, the Commission rejected the Peel plan primarily on the grounds that it could not be implemented without a massive forced transfer of Arabs (an option that the British government had already ruled out).  With dissent from some of its members, the Commission instead recommended a plan that would leave the Galilee under British mandate, but emphasised serious problems with it that included a lack of financial self-sufficiency of the proposed Arab State. The British Government accompanied the publication of the Woodhead Report by a statement of policy rejecting partition as impracticable due to ""political, administrative and financial difficulties"".

Resumed Revolt (September 1937 – August 1939)

With the failure of the Peel Commission's proposals the revolt resumed during the autumn of 1937 marked by the assassination on 26 September of Acting District Commissioner of the Galilee Lewis Andrews by Arab gunmen in Nazareth. On 30 September, regulations were issued allowing the Government to detain political deportees in any part of the British Empire, and authorizing the High Commissioner to outlaw associations whose objectives he regarded as contrary to public policy. Haj Amin al-Husseini was removed from the leadership of the Supreme Moslem Council and the General Waqf Committee, the local National Committees and the Arab Higher Committee were disbanded; five Arab leaders were arrested  and deported to the Seychelles; and in fear of arrest Jamal el-Husseini fled to Syria and Haj Amin el-Husseini to Lebanon; all frontiers with Palestine were closed, telephone connections to neighbouring countries were withdrawn, press censorship was introduced and a special concentration camp was opened near Acre.

In November 1937, the Irgun formally rejected the policy of Havlagah and embarked on a series of indiscriminate attacks against Arab civilians as a form of what the group called ""active defense"" against Arab attacks on Jewish civilians. The British authorities set up military courts, which were established for the trial of offenses connected with the carrying and discharge of firearms, sabotage and intimidation. Despite this, however, the Arab campaign of murder and sabotage continued and Arab gangs in the hills took on the appearance of organized guerrilla fighters.

Violence continued throughout 1938. In July 1938, when the Palestine Government seemed to have largely lost control of the situation, the garrison was strengthened from Egypt, and in September it was further reinforced from England. The police were placed under the operational control of the army commander, and military officials superseded the civil authorities in the enforcement of order. In October the Old City of Jerusalem, which had become a rebel stronghold, was reoccupied by the troops. By the end of the year a semblance of order had been restored in the towns, but terrorism continued in rural areas until the outbreak of the Second World War.

Despite cooperation of the Yishuv with the British to quell the revolt, some incidents towards the end of the conflict indicated a coming change in relations. On 12 June 1939, A British explosives expert was killed trying to defuse an Irgun bomb near a Jerusalem post office. On 26 August, two British police officers, Inspector Ronald Barker and Inspector Ralph Cairns, commander of the Jewish Department of the C.I.D., were killed by an Irgun mine in Jerusalem.

In the final fifteen months of the revolt alone there were 936 murders and 351 attempted murders; 2,125 incidents of sniping; 472 bombs thrown and detonated; 364 cases of armed robbery; 1,453 cases of sabotage against government and commercial property; 323 people abducted; 72 cases of intimidation; 236 Jews killed by Arabs and 435 Arabs killed by Jews; 1,200 rebels killed by the police and military and 535 wounded.

Response

Role of the Mandate Government and the British Army

Military law allowed swift prison sentences to be passed. Thousands of Arabs were held in administrative detention, without trial, and without proper sanitation, in overcrowded prison camps.

The British had already formalised the principle of collective punishment in Palestine in the 1924–1925 Collective Responsibility and Punishment Ordinances and updated these ordinances in 1936 with the Collective Fines Ordinance. These collective fines (amounting to £1,000,000 over the revolt) eventually became a heavy burden for poor Palestinian villagers, especially when the army also confiscated livestock, destroyed properties, imposed long curfews and established police posts, demolished houses and detained some or all of the Arab men in distant detention camps.

Full martial law was not introduced but in a series of Orders in Council and Emergency Regulations, 1936–37 'statutory' martial law, a stage between semi-military rule under civil powers and full martial law under military powers, and one in which the army and not the civil High Commissioner was pre-eminent was put in place. Following the Arab capture of the Old City of Jerusalem in October 1938, the army effectively took over Jerusalem and then all of Palestine.

The main form of collective punishment employed by the British forces was destruction of property. Sometimes entire villages were reduced to rubble, as happened to Mi'ar in October 1938; more often several prominent houses were blown up and others were trashed inside. The biggest single act of destruction occurred in Jaffa on 16 June 1936, when large gelignite charges were used to cut long pathways through the old city, destroying 220–240 buildings and rendering up to 6,000 Arabs homeless. Scathing criticism for this action from Palestine Chief Justice Sir Michael McDonnell was not well received by the administration and the judge was soon removed from the country. Villages were also frequently punished by fines and confiscation of livestock. The British even used sea mines from the battleship HMS Malaya to destroy houses.

In addition to actions against property, a large amount of brutality by the British forces occurred, including beatings, torture and extrajudicial killings. A surprisingly large number of prisoners were ""shot while trying to escape"". Several incidents involved serious atrocities, such as massacres at al-Bassa and Halhul. Desmond Woods, an officer of the Royal Ulster Rifles, described the massacre at al-Bassa:

Now I will never forget this incident ... We were at al-Malikiyya, the other frontier base and word came through about 6 o'clock in the morning that one of our patrols had been blown up and Millie Law [the dead officer] had been killed. Now Gerald Whitfeld [Lieutenant-Colonel G.H.P. Whitfeld, the battalion commander] had told these mukhtars that if any of this sort of thing happened he would take punitive measures against the nearest village to the scene of the mine. Well the nearest village to the scene of the mine was a place called al-Bassa and our Company C were ordered to take part in punitive measures. And I will never forget arriving at al-Bassa and seeing the Rolls Royce armoured cars of the 11th Hussars peppering Bassa with machine gun fire and this went on for about 20 minutes and then we went in and I remembered we had lighted braziers and we set the houses on fire and we burnt the village to the ground ... Monty had him [the battalion commander] up and he asked him all about it and Gerald Whitfeld explained to him. He said ""Sir, I have warned the mukhtars in these villages that if this happened to any of my officers or men, I would take punitive measures against them and I did this and I would've lost control of the frontier if I hadn't."" Monty said ""All right but just go a wee bit easier in the future.""

As well as destroying the village the RUR and men from the Royal Engineers collected around fifty men from al-Bassa and blew some of them up with explosion under a bus. Harry Arrigonie, a policeman who was present said that about twenty men were put onto a bus; those who tried to escape were shot and then the driver of the bus was forced to drive over a powerful land mine buried by the soldiers which completely destroyed the bus, scattering the mutilated bodies of the prisoners everywhere. The other villagers were then forced to bury the bodies in a pit.

Despite these measures Lieutenant-General Haining, the General Officer Commanding, reported secretly to the Cabinet on 1 December 1938 that ""practically every village in the country harbours and supports the rebels and will assist in concealing their identity from the Government Forces."" Haining reported the method for searching villages:

A cordon round the area to be searched is first established either by troops or aircraft and the inhabitants are warned that anybody trying to break through the cordon is likely to be shot. As literally hundreds of villages have been searched, in some cases more than once, during the past six months this procedure is well-known and it can be safely assumed that cordon-breakers have good reasons for wishing to avoid the troops. A number of such cordon-breakers have been shot during searches and it is probable that such cases form the basis of the propaganda that Arab prisoners are shot in cold blood and reported as ""killed while trying to escape"". After the cordon is established the troops enter the village and all male inhabitants are collected for identification and interrogation.

The report was issued in response to growing concern at the severity of the military measures amongst the general public in Great Britain, among members of the British Government, and among governments in countries neighbouring Palestine.

In addition to actions against villages the British Army also conducted punitive actions in the cities. In Nablus in August 1938 almost 5,000 men were held in a cage for two days and interrogated one after another. During their detention the city was searched and then each of the detainees was marked with a rubber stamp on his release. At one point a night curfew was imposed on most of the cities.

It was common British army practice to make local Arabs ride with military convoys to prevent mine attacks and sniping incidents: soldiers would tie the hostages to the bonnets of lorries, or put them on small flatbeds on the front of trains. The army told the hostages that any of them who tried to run away would be shot. On the lorries, some soldiers would brake hard at the end of a journey and then casually drive over the hostage, killing or maiming him, as Arthur Lane, a Manchester Regiment private recalled:

 ... when you'd finished your duty you would come away nothing had happened no bombs or anything and the driver would switch his wheel back and to make the truck waver and the poor wog on the front would roll off into the deck. Well if he was lucky he'd get away with a broken leg but if he was unlucky the truck behind coming up behind would hit him. But nobody bothered to pick up the bits they were left. You know we were there we were the masters we were the bosses and whatever we did was right ... Well you know you don't want him any more. He's fulfilled his job. And that's when Bill Usher [the commanding officer] said that it had to stop because before long they'd be running out of bloody rebels to sit on the bonnet.

British troops also left Arab wounded on the battlefield to die and maltreated Arab fighters taken in battle, so much so that the rebels tried to remove their wounded or dead from the field of battle. Sometimes, soldiers would occupy villages, expel all of the inhabitants and remain for months. The Army even burned the bodies of ""terrorists"" to prevent their funerals becoming the focus of protests.

Nevertheless, it has been argued that British behaviour overall was good compared to most other examples where a foreign army suppressed a popular insurgency.

Tegart forts

Sir Charles Tegart was a senior police officer brought into Palestine from the colonial force of British India on 21 October 1937.
Tegart and his deputy David Petrie (later head of MI5) advised a greater emphasis on foreign intelligence gathering and closure of Palestine's borders. Like many of those enrolled in the Palestinian gendarmerie, Tegart had served in Great Britain's repression of the Irish War of Independence, and the security proposals he introduced exceeded measures adopted down to this time elsewhere in the British Empire. 70 fortresses were erected throughout the country at strategic choke points and near Palestinian villages which, if assessed as ""bad"", were subjected to collective punishment.   Accordingly, from 1938 Gilbert Mackereth, the British Consul in Damascus, corresponded with Syrian and Transjordan authorities regarding border control and security to counteract arms smuggling and ""terrorist"" infiltration and produced a report for Tegart on the activities of the Palestine Defence Committee in Damascus. Tegart recommended the construction of a frontier road with a barbed wire fence, which became known as Tegart's wall, along the borders with Lebanon and Syria to help prevent the flow of insurgents, goods and weapons. Tegart encouraged close co-operation with the Jewish Agency. It was built by the Histadrut construction company Solel Boneh. The total cost was £2 million. The Army forced the fellahin to work on the roads without pay.

Tegart introduced Arab Investigation Centres where prisoners were subjected to beatings, foot whipping, electric shocks, denailing and what is now known as ""waterboarding"". Tegart also imported Doberman Pinschers from South Africa and set up a special centre in Jerusalem to train interrogators in torture.

Role of the Royal Air Force
The Royal Air Force developed close air support into its then most refined form during the Arab Revolt. Air patrols had been found effective in keeping convoys and trains free from attack, but this did not help to expose insurgents to battle conditions likely to cause their defeat. From the middle of June 1936 wireless vehicles accompanied all convoys and patrols. During rebel attacks these vehicles could issue emergency ""XX calls"" (XX with a coded location), which were given priority over all other radio traffic, to summon aerial reinforcements. Bombers, which were usually airborne within five minutes, could then either attack insurgents directly or ""fix"" their position for infantry troops. Forty-seven such XX calls were issued during the revolt, causing heavy losses to the rebels. In the June 1936 Battle of Nur Shams British planes attacked Arab irregulars with machine gun fire.

This use of air power was so successful that the British were able to reduce the regular garrison.

In 1936 an Air Staff Officer in Middle East Command based in the Kingdom of Egypt, Arthur Harris, known as an advocate of ""air policing"", commented on the revolt saying that ""one 250 lb. or 500 lb. bomb in each village that speaks out of turn"" would satisfactorily solve the problem. In 1937 Harris was promoted to Air Commodore and in 1938 he was posted to Palestine and Trans-Jordan as Air Officer Commanding the RAF contingent in the region until September 1939. ""Limited"" bombing attacks on Arab villages were carried out by the RAF, although at times this involved razing whole villages. Harris described the system by which recalcitrant villages were kept under control by aerial bombardment as ""Air-Pin"".

Aircraft of the RAF were also used to drop propaganda leaflets over Palestinian towns and villages telling the fellahin that they were the main sufferers of the rebellion and threatening an increase in taxes.

Low flying RAF squadrons were able to produce detailed intelligence on the location of road blocks, sabotaged bridges, railways and pipelines. RAF aerial photographs were also used to build up a detailed map of Arab population distribution.

Although the British Army was responsible for setting up the Arab counter-insurgent forces (known as the peace bands) and supplying them with arms and money these were operated by RAF Intelligence, commanded by Patrick Domville.

At the beginning of the revolt RAF assets in the region comprised a bomber flight at RAF Ramleh, an RAF armoured car flight at Ramleh, fourteen bomber squadrons at RAF Amman, and a RAF armoured car company at Ma'an.

Role of the Royal Navy

At the beginning of the Revolt crew from the Haifa Naval Force's two cruisers were used to carry out tasks ashore, manning two howitzers and naval lorries equipped with QF 2 pounder naval guns and searchlights used to disperse Arab snipers. From the end of June two destroyers were used to patrol the coast of Palestine in a bid to prevent gun running. These searched as many as 150 vessels per week and were an effective preventive measure. At the request of the Army additional naval platoons landed in July to help protect Haifa and Jewish settlements in the surrounding countryside. The Navy also relieved the Army of duties in Haifa by using nine naval platoons to form the Haifa Town Force and in August three naval platoons were landed to support the police.

Following publication of the Peel Commission's report in July 1937 HMS Repulse sailed to Haifa where landing parties were put ashore to maintain calm. Various other naval vessels continued with this role until the end of the revolt.

Following the Irgun's detonation of a large bomb in a market in Haifa on 6 July 1938 the High Commissioner signalled the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, requesting the assistance of naval vessels capable of providing landing parties. Pound dispatched HMS Repulse and diverted HMS Emerald to Haifa, which arrived the same day and landed five platoons, one to each police district. HMS Repulse relieved HMS Emerald the following day and after another bomb was detonated on 10 July five platoons from the ship, made up of sailors and Royal Marines, dispersed mobs and patrolled the city.

On 11 July provision of three platoons from Repulse released men of the West Kent Regiment for a punitive mission against Arabs who had attacked a Jewish colony near Haifa. By 17 July the Repulse established a Company Headquarters where seamen and Royal Marines manned a 3.7-inch howitzer. Sailors, Royal Marines, and men of the Suffolk Regiment, who had embarked on the Repulse, accompanied foot patrols of the Palestine Police Force.

The Repulse,  and HMS Warspite provided howitzer crews which were sent ashore to combat gun running near the border with Lebanon. Detained Arabs were used to build emplacements and the howitzers were moved quickly between these positions by day and night to confuse bandits as to the likely direction of fire. Periodically, the guns were used to fire warning rounds close to the vicinity of villages believed to have rebel sympathies.

Strategic importance of Haifa
Britain had completed the modern deep-sea port in Haifa in 1933 and finished laying a pipeline from the Iraqi oilfields to Haifa in 1935, shortly before the outbreak of the revolt. A refinery for processing oil from the pipeline was completed by Consolidated Refineries Ltd, a company jointly owned by British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell, in December 1939.

These facilities enhanced the strategic importance of Palestine and of Haifa in particular in Britain's control of the eastern Mediterranean. The threat to British control of the region posed by the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in October 1935 and the deteriorating situation in Europe toward the end of the 1930s probably made British policy makers more willing to make concessions to Arab governments on the Palestine issue following the furore over the recommendations of the Peel Commission.

Role of the British intelligence services

The Arab Revolt was the last major test of Britain's security services in the Middle East before World War II. The development and deployment of intelligence-led counterinsurgency strategies was integral to the restoration of British imperial control in Palestine as the revolt had demonstrated to the British authorities how a popular rebellion could undermine intelligence gathering operations and thereby impair their ability to predict and respond to inter-communal disorder. The rebellion had brought together urban nationalism and peasant economic grievances arising from rural poverty and landlessness, which was blamed on British misrule. Accordingly, the Palestinian revolt targeted the political and economic apparatus of the British colonial state, including the communications network, pipelines, police stations, army outposts and British personnel. It was this aspect of the revolt, rather than attacks on Jews or violence between rivals for leadership of the national movement, that most concerned the high commissioner. The mandate authorities were further disturbed by the unity of purpose displayed during the six-month general strike and by the resurgence of pan-Arab nationalism as evidenced by the rise of the Istiqlal Party.

In response to these challenges the British army command (""I"" Branch) and battalion headquarters across Palestine issued a daily intelligence bulletin every afternoon detailing political developments. Special Service Officers (SSOs) assigned to intelligence gathering reported directly to their local command headquarters and their cars were equipped with wireless transmitters so that high grade intelligence could be reported directly to ""I"" Branch immediately. These sources of intelligence gradually became more important than those of the C.I.D. in Palestine, which had been dependent on Arab informers, and which were no longer reliable.

In September 1937, the Jewish Agency appointed Reuven Zaslany liaison officer for intelligence and security affairs between the Political Department of the Jewish Agency and the intelligence arms of the Royal Air Force and the C.I.D. Zaslany sifted through intelligence collected by Jewish-controlled field operatives and forwarded it to the British military. He was a frequent visitor at the headquarters of British intelligence and the army, the police and C.I.D. and he also travelled to Damascus to liaise with the Arab opposition's peace bands and with the British Consul in Iraq. Colonel Frederick Kisch, a British army officer and Zionist leader, was appointed chief liaison officer between the British army and the Jewish Agency Executive with Zaslany as his deputy. Zaslany also worked as interpreter for Patrick Domville, head of RAF Intelligence in Palestine (who was described by Haganah leader Dov Hos as the ""best Zionist informer on the English""), until the latter was posted to Iraq in 1938, and through him became acquainted with many of the British intelligence officers.

In 1937 the Jewish Agency's intelligence groups were responsible for bugging the Peel Commission hearings in Palestine. Eventually, the Arab Revolt convinced the Agency that a central intelligence service was required and this led to the formation of a counter-intelligence agency known as the Ran (headed by Yehuda Arazi, who also helped to smuggle rifles, machine guns and ammunition from Poland to Palestine) and thereafter in 1940 to the creation of SHAI, the forerunner of Mossad.

British and Jewish co-operation

The Haganah (Hebrew for ""defence""), a Jewish paramilitary organisation, actively supported British efforts to suppress the uprising, which reached 10,000 Arab fighters at their peak during the summer and fall of 1938. Although the British administration did not officially recognise the Haganah, the British security forces cooperated with it by forming the Jewish Settlement Police, Jewish Supernumerary Police, and Special Night Squads. The Special Night Squads engaged in activities described by colonial administrator Sir Hugh Foot, as 'extreme and cruel' involving torture, whipping, abuse and execution of Arabs.

The British authorities maintained, financed and armed the Jewish police from this point onward until the end of the Mandate, and by the end of September 1939 around 20,000 Jewish policeman, supernumeraries and settlement guards had been authorised to carry arms by the government, which also distributed weapons to outlying Jewish settlements, and allowed the Haganah to acquire arms. Independently of the British, Ta'as, the Haganah's clandestine munitions industry, developed an 81-mm mortar and manufactured mines and grenades, 17,500 of the latter being produced for use during the revolt.

In June 1937, the British imposed the death penalty for unauthorised possession of weapons, ammunition, and explosives, but since many Jews had permission to carry weapons and store ammunition for defence this order was directed primarily against Palestinian Arabs and most of the 112 executed in Acre Prison were hanged for illegal possession of arms.

In principle all of the joint units functioned as part of the British administration, but in practice they were under the command of the Jewish Agency and ""intended to form the backbone of a Jewish military force set up under British sponsorship in preparation for the inevitable clash with the Arabs."" The Agency and the Mandate authorities shared the costs of the new units equally. The administration also provided security services to Jewish commercial concerns at cost.

Jewish and British officials worked together to co-ordinate manhunts and collective actions against villages and also discussed the imposition of penalties and sentences. Overall, the Jewish Agency was successful in making ""the point that the Zionist movement and the British Empire were standing shoulder to shoulder against a common enemy, in a war in which they had common goals.""

The rebellion also inspired the Jewish Agency to expand the intelligence-gathering of its Political Department and especially of its Arab Division, with the focus changing from political to military intelligence. The Arab Division set up a network of Jewish controllers and Arab agents around the country. Some of the intelligence gathered was shared with the British administration, the exchange of information sometimes being conducted by Moshe Shertok, then head of the Jewish Agency, directly with the high commissioner himself. Shertok also advised the administration on political affairs, on one occasion convincing the high commissioner not to arrest Professor Joseph Klausner, a Revisionist Maximalist activist who had played a key role in the riots of 1929, because of the likely negative consequences.

Forces of the Jewish settlement

† Ta'as and Rekhesh were developed and expanded during the Arab Revolt but already existed before 1936 and of course the Haganah had been in operation from the earliest days of the Mandate.

Haganah intelligence services
There was no single body within the Jewish settlement capable of co-ordinating intelligence gathering before 1939. Until then there were four separate organisations without any regular or formal liaison. These were an underground militia, forerunner of the first official information service, Sherut Yediot (Shai); the Arab Platoon of the Palmach, which was staffed by Jews who were Arab-speaking and Arab-looking; Rekhesh, the arms procurement service, which had its own intelligence gathering capabilities, and likewise the Mossad LeAliyah Bet, the illegal immigration service. In mid-1939 the effort to co-ordinate the activities of these groups was led by Shaul Avigur and Moshe Shertok.

Role of the Revisionist Zionists

In 1931, a Revisionist underground splinter group broke off from Haganah, calling itself the Irgun organisation (or Etzel). The organisation took its orders from Revisionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky who was at odds with the dominant Labour Zionist movement led by David Ben-Gurion. The rift between the two Zionist movements further deteriorated in 1933 when two Revisionists were blamed for the murder of Haim Arlosoroff, who had negotiated the Haavara Agreement between the Jewish Agency and Nazi Germany. The agreement brought 52,000 German Jews to Palestine between 1933 and 1939, and generated $30,000,000 for the then almost bankrupt Jewish Agency, but in addition to the difficulties with the Revisionists, who advocated a boycott of Germany, it caused the Yishuv to be isolated from the rest of world Jewry.

Ultimately, however, the events of the Arab Revolt blurred the differences between the gradualist approach of Ben-Gurion and the Maximalist Iron Wall approach of Jabotinsky and turned militarist patriotism into a bipartisan philosophy. Indeed, Ben-Gurion's own Special Operations Squads conducted a punitive operation in the Arab village of Lubya firing weapons into a room through a window killing two men and one woman and injuring three people, including two children.

From October 1937 the Irgun instituted a wave of bombings against Arab crowds and buses. For the first time in the conflict massive bombs were placed in crowded Arab public places, killing and maiming dozens. These attacks substantially increased Arab casualties and sowed terror among the population. The first attack was on 11 November 1937, killing two Arabs at the bus depot near Jaffa Street in Jerusalem and then on 14 November, a day later commemorated as the ""Day of the Breaking of the Havlagah (restraint),"" Arabs were killed in simultaneous attacks around Palestine. More deadly attacks followed: on 6 July 1938 21 Arabs were killed and 52 wounded by a bomb in a Haifa market; on 25 July a second market bomb in Haifa killed at least 39 Arabs and injured 70; a bomb in Jaffa's vegetable market on 26 August killed 24 Arabs and wounded 39. The attacks were condemned by the Jewish Agency.

The Arab leader Mohammad Amin al-Husayni and his associates also received funding from Fascist Italy during the revolt as the Italians were in dispute with the United Kingdom over Abyssinia and wished not only to disrupt the British rear but also to extend Italian influence in the region. Files seized at the German High Command in Flansburg reveal that the Arab riots ""only through funds made available by Germany to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem was it possible to carry out the revolt in Palestine.""

Role of the ""Peace bands""

The ""peace bands"" (fasa'il al-salam) or ""Nashashibi units"" were made up of disaffected Arab peasants recruited by the British administration and the Nashashibis in late 1938 to battle against Arab rebels during the revolt. Despite their peasant origins the bands were representative mainly of the interests of landlords and rural notables. Some peace bands also sprang up in the Nablus area, on Mount Carmel (a stronghold of the Druze who largely opposed the rebellion after 1937), and around Nazareth without connection to the Nashashibi-Husayni power struggle.

From December 1937 the main opposition figures among the Arabs approached the Jewish Agency for funding and assistance, motivated by the assassination campaign pursued by the rebels at the behest of the Husseini leadership. In October 1937, shortly after Mohammad Amin al-Husayni, the leader of the Arab Higher Committee, had fled from Palestine to escape British retribution, Raghib al-Nashashibi had written to Moshe Shertok stating his full willingness to co-operate with the Jewish Agency and to agree with whatever policy it proposed. From early in 1938 the Nashashibis received funding specifically to conduct anti-rebel operations, with Raghib al-Nashashibi himself receiving £5,000. The British also supplied funding to the peace bands and sometimes directed their operations.

Fakhri Nashashibi was particularly successful in recruiting peace bands in the Hebron hills, on one occasion in December 1938 gathering 3,000 villagers for a rally in Yatta, also attended by the British military commander of the Jerusalem District General Richard O'Connor.

Just two months earlier, on 15 October 1938, rebels had seized the Old City and barricaded the gates. O'Connor had planned the operation by which men of the Coldstream Guards, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers and Black Watch recaptured the Old City, killing 19 rebels. He was later to win fame as the field commander for Operation Compass in World War II, in which his forces completely destroyed a much larger Italian army—a victory which nearly drove the Axis from Africa, and in turn, led Adolf Hitler to send the German Africa Corps under Erwin Rommel to try to reverse the situation.

Towards the end of the revolt in May 1939 the authorities dissolved the peace bands and confiscated their arms. However, because members of the bands had become tainted in the eyes of the Palestinian Arabs, and some were under sentence of death, they had little choice but to continue the battle against the national movement's leadership, which they did with the continuing help of the Zionist movement.

Role of rebel leaders

At least 282 rebel leaders took part in the Arab Revolt, including four Christians. Rebel forces consisted of loosely organized bands known as fasa'il (sing: fasil). The leader of a fasil was known as a qa'id al-fasil (pl. quwwa'id al-fasa'il), which means ""band commander"". The Jewish press often referred to them as ""brigands"", while the British authorities and media called them ""bandits"", ""terrorists"", ""rebels"" or ""insurgents"", but never ""nationalists"". Ursabat (meaning ""gangs"") was another Arabic term used for the rebels, and it spawned the British soldiers' nickname for all rebels, which was Oozlebart.

According to historian Simon Anglim, the rebel groups were divided into general categories: mujahadeen and fedayeen. The former were guerrillas who engaged in armed confrontations, while the latter committed acts of sabotage. According to later accounts of some surviving rebel leaders from the Galilee, the mujahideen maintained little coordination with the nominal hierarchy of the revolt. Most ambushes were the result of a local initiative undertaken by a qa'id or a group of quwwa'id from the same area.

Galilee
Abdul Khallik was an effective peasant leader appointed by Fawzi al-Qawuqji who caused great damage and loss of life in the Nazareth District and was thus a significant adversary of the Mandate and Jewish settlement authorities. He was trapped by British troops in a major engagement on 2 October 1938 and was killed whilst trying to lead his men to safety. Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir was the main Qassamite rebel leader in the Upper Galilee and was the only active rebel leader on the ground who was a member of the Damascus-based Central Committee of National Jihad. Abdallah al-Asbah was a prominent commander active in the Safad region of northeastern Galilee. He was killed by British forces who besieged him and his comrades near the border with Lebanon in early 1937.

Jabal Nablus area
Abd al-Rahim al-Hajj Muhammad from the Tulkarm area was a deeply religious, intellectual man and as a fervent anti-Zionist, he was deeply committed to the revolt. He was regarded second to Qawukji in terms of leadership ability and maintained his independence from the exiled rebel leadership in Damascus. He personally led his  fasa'il and carried out nighttime attacks against British targets in the revolt's early stage in 1936. When the revolt was renewed in April 1937, he established a more organised command hierarchy consisting of four main brigades who operated in the north-central highlands (Tulkarm-Nablus-Jenin area). He competed for the position of General Commander of the Revolt with Aref Abdul Razzik, and the two served the post in rotation from September 1938 to February 1939, when al-Hajj Muhammad was confirmed as the sole General Commander.

Al-Hajj Muhammad refused to carry out political assassinations at the behest of political factions, including al-Husayni, once stating ""I don't work for Husayniya ('Husanyni-ism'), but for wataniya ('nationalism')."" He is still known by Palestinians as a hero and martyr and is regarded as a metonym ""for a national movement that was popular, honourable, religious, and lofty in its aims and actions."" He was shot dead in a firefight with British forces outside the village of Sanur on 27 March 1939, after Farid Irsheid's peace band informed the authorities of his location.

Yusuf Abu Durra, a Qassamite leader in the Jenin area, was born in Silat al-Harithiya and before becoming a rebel worked as a Gazoz vendor. He was said to be a narrow-minded man who thrived on extortion and cruelty and thus became greatly feared. Yusuf Hamdan was Durra's more respected lieutenant and later a leader of his own unit; he was killed by an army patrol in 1939 and buried in al-Lajjun. Durra himself was apprehended by the Arab Legion in Transjordan on 25 July 1939 and subsequently hanged.

Fakhri Abdul Hadi of Arrabah worked closely with Fawzi al-Qawukji in 1936, but later defected to the British authorities. He bargained for a pardon by offering to collaborate with the British on countering rebel propaganda. Once on the payroll of the British consul in Damascus, Gilbert Mackereth, he carried out many attacks against the rebels in 1938–1939 as leader of his own ""peace band"".

Aref Abdul Razzik of Tayibe was responsible for the area south of Tulkarm and was known for evading capture whilst being pursued by the security forces. He signed his bulletins as 'The Ghost of Sheikh Qassam'. Razzik assumed a place in British army folklore and the troops sang a song about him. Razzik was capable and daring and gained a reputation as one of the army's problem heroes.

Jerusalem area
Issa Battat was a peasant leader in the southern hills below Jerusalem who caused enormous damage to security patrols in his area. He was killed by a patrol of armed police in a battle near Hebron in 1937.

Arab volunteers
In the first phase of the revolt, around 300 volunteers, mostly veterans of the Ottoman Army and/or rebels from the Great Syrian Revolt (1925–27), deployed in northern Palestine. Their overall commander was Fawzi al-Qawuqji and his deputies were Said al-As and Muhammad al-Ashmar. Qawuqji also led the volunteer force's Iraqi and Transjordanian battalions, and al-Ashmar was commander of the Syrian battalion, which largely consisted of volunteers from Damascus's al-Midan Quarter, Hama and Homs. The Druze ex-Ottoman officer, Hamad Sa'ab, commanded the Lebanese battalion.

Outcome

Casualties

Despite the intervention of up to 50,000 British troops and 15,000 Haganah men, the uprising continued for over three years. By the time it concluded in September 1939, more than 5,000 Arabs, over 300 Jews, and 262 Britons had been killed and at least 15,000 Arabs were wounded.

Impact on the Jewish Yishuv

In the overall context of the Jewish settlement's development in the 1930s the physical losses endured during the revolt were relatively insignificant. Although hundreds were killed and property was damaged no Jewish settlement was captured or destroyed and several dozen new ones were established. Over 50,000 new Jewish immigrants arrived in Palestine. In 1936 Jews made up about one-third of the population.

The hostilities contributed to further disengagement of the Jewish and Arab economies in Palestine, which were intertwined to some extent until that time. Development of the economy and infrastructure accelerated. For example, whereas the Jewish city of Tel Aviv relied on the nearby Arab seaport of Jaffa, hostilities dictated the construction of a separate Jewish-run seaport for Tel Aviv, inspiring the delighted Ben-Gurion to note in his diary ""we ought to reward the Arabs for giving us the impetus for this great creation."" Metal works were established to produce armoured sheeting for vehicles and a rudimentary arms industry was founded. The settlement's transportation capabilities were enhanced and Jewish unemployment was relieved owing to the employment of police officers, and replacement of striking Arab labourers, employees, craftsman and farmers by Jewish workers. Most of the important industries in Palestine were owned by Jews and in trade and the banking sector they were much better placed than the Arabs.

As a result of collaboration with the British colonial authorities and security forces many thousands of young men had their first experience of military training, which Moshe Shertok and Haganah leader Eliyahu Golomb cited as one of the fruits of the Haganah's policy of havlagah (restraint).

Although the Jewish settlement in Palestine was dismayed by the publication of the 1939 White Paper restricting Jewish immigration, David Ben-Gurion remained undeterred, believing that the policy would not be implemented, and in fact Neville Chamberlain had told him that the policy would last at the very most only for the duration of the war. In the event the White Paper quotas were exhausted only in December 1944, over five and a half years later, and in the same period the United Kingdom absorbed 50,000 Jewish refugees and the British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada and South Africa) took many thousands more. During the War over 30,000 Jews joined the British forces and even the Irgun ceased operations against the British until 1944.

Impact on the Palestinian Arabs
The revolt weakened the military strength of Palestinian Arabs in advance of their ultimate confrontation with the Jewish settlement in the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine and was thus counterproductive. During the uprising, British authorities attempted to confiscate all weapons from the Arab population. This, and the destruction of the main Arab political leadership in the revolt, greatly hindered their military efforts in the 1948 Palestine war, where imbalances between the Jewish and Arab economic performance, social cohesion, political organisation and military capability became apparent.

The Mufti, Hajj Amin al-Husseini and his supporters directed a Jihad against any person who did not obey the Mufti. Their national struggle was a religious holy war, and the incarnation of both the Palestinian Arab nation and Islam was Hajj Amin al-Husseini. Anyone who rejected his leadership was a heretic and his life was forfeit. After the Peel report publication, the murders of Arabs leaders who opposed the Mufti were accelerated. Pressed by the assassination campaign pursued by the rebels at the behest of the Husseini leadership, the opposition had a security cooperation with the Jews. The flight of wealthy Arabs, which occurred during the revolt, was also replicated in 1947–49.

Thousands of Palestinian houses were destroyed, and massive financial costs were incurred because of the general strike and the devastation of fields, crops and orchards. The economic boycott further damaged the fragile Palestinian Arab economy through loss of sales and goods and increased unemployment.

Clearly, the revolt did not achieve its goals, although it is ""credited with signifying the birth of the Arab Palestinian identity."" It is generally credited with forcing the issuance of the White Paper of 1939 in which Britain retreated from the partition arrangements proposed by the Peel Commission in favour of the creation of a binational state within ten years, although The League of Nations commission held that the White Paper was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past. The White Paper of 1939 was regarded by many as incompatible with the commitment to a Jewish National Home in Palestine, as proclaimed in the 1917 Balfour Declaration. Al-Husseini rejected the new policy, although it seems that the ordinary Palestinian Arab accepted the White Paper of 1939. His biographer, Philip Mattar wrote that in that case, the Mufti preferred his personal interests and the ideology rather than the practical considerations.

Impact on the British Empire
As the inevitable war with Germany approached, British policy makers concluded that although they could rely on the support of the Jewish population in Palestine, who had no alternative but to support Britain, the support of Arab governments and populations in an area of great strategic importance for the British Empire was not assured. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain concluded ""if we must offend one side, let us offend the Jews rather than the Arabs.""

In February 1939 Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald called together a conference of Arab and Zionist leaders on the future of Palestine at St. James's Palace in London but the discussions ended without agreement on 27 March. The government's new policy as published in White Paper of 17 May had been determined already and despite Jewish protests and Irgun attacks the British remained resolute.

There was a growing feeling among British officials that there was nothing left for them to do in Palestine.
Perhaps the ultimate achievement of the Arab Revolt was to make the British sick of Palestine. Major-General Bernard ""Monty"" Montgomery concluded, ""the Jew murders the Arab and the Arab murders the Jew. This is what is going on in Palestine now. And it will go on for the next 50 years in all probability.""

Historiography

The 1936–39 Arab Revolt has been and still is marginalized in both Western and Israeli historiography on Palestine, and even progressive Western scholars have little to say about the anti-colonial struggle of the Palestinian Arab rebels against the British Empire. According to Swedenberg's analysis, for instance, the Zionist version of Israeli history acknowledges only one authentic national movement: the struggle for Jewish self-determination that resulted in the Israeli Declaration of Independence in May 1948. Swedenberg writes that the Zionist narrative has no room for an anticolonial and anti-British Palestinian national revolt.  Zionists often describe the revolt as a series of ""events"" (Hebrew מאורעות תרצ""ו-תרצ""ט) ""riots"", or ""happenings"".

The appropriate description was debated by Jewish Agency officials, who were keen not to give a negative impression of Palestine to prospective immigrants. In private, however, David Ben-Gurion was unequivocal: the Arabs, he said, were ""fighting dispossession ... The fear is not of losing land, but of losing the homeland of the Arab people, which others want to turn into the homeland of the Jewish people.""

"Culture of France

The culture of France has been shaped by geography, by historical events, and by foreign and internal forces and groups. France, and in particular Paris, has played an important role as a center of high culture since the 17th century and from the 19th century on, worldwide. From the late 19th century, France has also played an important role in cinema, fashion, cuisine, literature, technology, social science and mathematics. The importance of French culture has waxed and waned over the centuries, depending on its economic, political and military importance. French culture today is marked both by great regional and socioeconomic differences and strong unifying tendencies. A global opinion poll for the BBC saw France ranked as the country with the fourth most positive influence in the world (behind Germany, Canada and the UK) in 2014.

France Culture 

The Académie française sets an official standard of language purity; however, this standard, which is not mandatory, is occasionally ignored by the government itself: for instance, the left-wing government of Lionel Jospin pushed for the feminisation of the names of some functions (madame la ministre) while the Académie pushed for some more traditional madame le ministre.

Some action has been taken by the government in order to promote French culture and the French language. For instance, they have established a system of subsidies and preferential loans for supporting French cinema. The Toubon law, from the name of the conservative culture minister who promoted it, makes it mandatory to use French in advertisements directed to the general public. Note that contrary to some misconceptions sometimes found in the Anglophone media, the French government neither regulates the language used by private parties in commercial settings, nor makes it compulsory that France-based WWW sites should be in French.

France counts many regional languages, some of them being very different from standard French, such as Breton (a Celtic language close to Cornish and Welsh) and Alsatian (an Alemannic dialect of German). Some regional languages are Roman, like French, such as Occitan. The Basque language is completely unrelated to the French language and to any other language in the world; it is spoken in an area that straddles the border between the southwest of France and the north of Spain.

Many of these languages have enthusiastic advocates; however, the real importance of local languages remains subject to debate. In April 2001, the Minister of Education, Jack Lang, admitted formally that for more than two centuries, the political powers of the French government had repressed regional languages. He announced that bilingual education would, for the first time, be recognised, and bilingual teachers recruited in French public schools to support teaching these other languages. 
In French schools, pupils are expected to learn at least two foreign languages, the first of which is typically German or English.

A revision of the French constitution creating official recognition of regional languages was implemented by the Parliament in Congress at Versailles in July 2008.

Religions in France

France is a secular country where freedom of thought and of religion is preserved, by virtue of the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The Republic is based on the principle of laïcité, that is of freedom of religion (including of agnosticism and atheism) enforced by the Jules Ferry laws and the 1905 law on the separation of the State and the Church, enacted at the beginning of the Third Republic (1871–1940). A 2011 European poll found that a third (33%) of the French population ""does not believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force. In 2011, in a poll published by Institut français d'opinion publique 65% of the French population describes itself as Christians, and 25% as not adhering any religion.

According to Eurobarometer poll in 2012, Christianity is the largest religion in France accounting 60% of French citizens. Catholics are the largest Christian group in France, accounting for 50% of French citizens, while Protestants make up 8%, and other Christians make up 2%. Non believer/Agnostic account for 20%, Atheist 13%, and Muslim 7%.

France guarantees freedom of religion as a constitutional right, and the government generally respects this right in practice. A long history of violent conflict between groups led the state to break its ties to the established Catholic Church early in the last century, which previously had been the state religion. The government adopted a strong commitment to maintaining a totally secular public sector.

Catholicism

Long the established state religion, the Roman Catholic Church has historically played a significant role in French culture and in French life. Kings were considered head of the church and state. Most French people are Roman Catholic Christians; however, many of them are secular but still place high value on Catholicism.

The Roman Catholic faith is no longer considered the state religion, as it was before the 1789 Revolution and throughout the various, non-republican regimes of the 19th century (the Restoration, the July Monarchy and the Second Empire). The Official split of Catholic Church and State (""Séparation de l'Eglise et de l'Etat"") took place in 1905. This  major reform emphazised the Laicist and anti-clericalist mood of French Radical Republicans in this period.

At the beginning of the 20th century, France was a largely rural country with conservative Catholic mores, but in the hundred years since then, the countryside has become depopulated as people have become urbanized. The urban populations have become more secular. A December 2006 poll by Harris Interactive, published in The Financial Times, found that 32% of the French population described themselves as agnostic, some 32% as atheist, and only 27% believed in any type of God or supreme being.

Protestantism

France was touched by the Reformation during the 16th century; some 30% of the population converted to Protestantism and became known as French Huguenots. Some princes joined the reform movement. But the national monarchy felt threatened by people who wanted to leave the established state religion. Protestants were discriminated against and suppressed. On August 24, 1572, the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre took place in Paris and the French Wars of Religion are considered to have begun. this French civil war took place between Catholics, led by Henry I, Duke of Guise, and Protestants, led by Henri de Navarre. Henri de Navarre became king after converting to Catholicism in 1589.

Louis XIII, Henri IV's son, began to suppress Protestants in violent attacks, such as the Siege of La Rochelle. After Louis XIV revoked the Edit de Nantes in 1685, Protestants who did not leave the country were generally suppressed. Thousands of Protestant Huguenots emigrated from France for their safety and to gain religious freedom, generally going to Protestant nations such as the Netherlands, England, South Africa, and the North American colonies. Their exile continued during the 17th century and until 1787, when religious freedom was re-established by Louis XVI.

Judaism

The current Jewish community in France numbers around 600,000, according to the World Jewish Congress and 500,000 according to the Appel Unifié Juif de France. It is concentrated in the metropolitan areas of Paris, Marseille and Strasbourg.

The history of the Jews in France dates back over 2,000 years. In the early Middle Ages, France was a center of Jewish learning, but persecution increased as the Middle Ages wore on. France was the first country in Europe to emancipate its Jewish population during the French Revolution, but despite legal equality anti-Semitism remained an issue, as illustrated in the Dreyfus affair of the late 19th century. However, through the 1870 Décret Crémieux, France secured full citizenship for the Jews in then French-ruled Algeria. Despite the death of a quarter of all French Jews during the Holocaust, France currently has the largest Jewish population in Europe.

In the early 21st century, French Jews are mostly Sephardic and of North African origins. More than a quarter of the historic Ashkenazi Jewish community was destroyed during the Holocaust of World War II after German forces occupied France and established the Vichy Regime. Jewish religious affiliations range from the ultra-Orthodox Haredi communities to the large segment of Jews who are secular and identify culturally as Jews.

Islam

Islam is the third-largest faith in France in the early 21st century. The Grande Mosquée was constructed in Paris in 1929 in honour of French colonial troops from North Africa who fought in the First World War. Arabs from North Africa started to settle in France. In the early 21st century, France had the largest Muslim population (in percentage) of any Western European country. This is a result of immigration and permanent family settlement in France, from the 1960s on, of groups from, principally, former French colonies in North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia), and, to a lesser extent, other areas such as Turkey and West Africa.  The government does not collect data on religious beliefs in census records, but estimates and polls place the percentage of Muslims at between 4% and 7%.

Buddhism

Buddhism is widely reported to be the fifth largest religion in France, after Christianity, atheism, Islam, and Judaism. France has over two hundred Buddhist meditation centers, including about twenty sizable retreat centers in rural areas. The Buddhist population mainly consists of Chinese and Vietnamese immigrants, with a substantial minority of native French converts and ""sympathizers"". The rising popularity of Buddhism in France has been the subject of considerable discussion in the French media and academy in recent years.

Cults and new religious movements
France created in 2006 the first French parliamentary commission on cult activities which led to a report registering a number of cults considered as dangerous. Supporters of such movements have criticized the report on the grounds of the respect of religious freedom. Proponents of the measure contend that only dangerous cults have been listed as such, and state secularism ensures religious freedom in France.

Regional customs and traditions
Modern France is the result of centuries of nation building and the acquisition and incorporation of a number of historical provinces and overseas colonies into its geographical and political structure. These regions all evolved with their own specific cultural and linguistic traditions in fashion, religious observance, regional language and accent, family structure, cuisine, leisure activities, industry, and including the simple way to pour wine,  etc.

The evolution of the French state and culture, from the Renaissance up to this day, has however promoted a centralization of politics, media and cultural production in and around Paris (and, to a lesser extent, around the other major urban centers), and the industrialization of the country in the 20th century has led to a massive move of French people from the countryside to urban areas. At the end of the 19th century, around 50% of the French depended on the land for a living; today French farmers only make up 6-7%, while 73% live in cities.  Nineteenth century French literature abounds in scenes of provincial youth ""coming up"" to Paris to ""make it"" in the cultural, political or social scene of the capital (this scheme is frequent in the novels of Balzac). Policies enacted by the French Third Republic also encouraged this displacement through mandatory military service, a centralized national educational system, and suppression of regional languages. While government policy and public debate in France in recent years has returned to a valorization of regional differences and a call for decentralization of certain aspects of the public sphere (sometimes with ethnic, racial or reactionary overtones), the history of regional displacement and the nature of the modern urban environment and of mass media and culture have made the preservation of a regional ""sense of place or culture"" in today's France extremely difficult.

The names of the historical French provinces — such as Brittany (Bretagne), Berry, Orléanais, Normandy (Normandie), Languedoc, Lyonnais, Dauphiné, Champagne, Poitou, Guyenne and Gascony (Gascogne), Burgundy (Bourgogne), Picardy (Picardie), Provence, Touraine, Limousin,  Auvergne, Béarn, Alsace, Flanders, Lorraine, Corsica (Corse), Savoy (Savoie)... (please see individual articles for specifics about each regional culture) — are still used to designate natural, historical and cultural regions, and many of them appear in modern région or département names.  These names are also used by the French in their self-identification of family origin.

Regional identification is most pronounced today in cultures linked to regional languages and non-French-speaking traditions - French language itself being only a dialect of Langue d'oïl, the mother language of many of the languages to-be-mentioned, which became a national vehicular language, like (in alphabetical order): Alsatian, Arpitan, Basque, Brezhoneg (Breton), Burgundian, Corsu (Corsican), Català (Catalan), Francique, Gallo, Lorrain, Norman, Occitan, Picard, Poitevin, Saintongeais, etc., and some of these regions have promoted movements calling for some degree of regional autonomy, and, occasionally, national independence (see, for example, Breton nationalism, Corsica and Occitania).

There are huge differences in life style, socioeconomic status and world view between Paris and the provinces.  The French often use the expression ""la France profonde"" (""Deep France"", similar to ""heartland"") to designate the profoundly ""French"" aspects of provincial towns, village life and rural agricultural culture, which escape the hegemony of Paris.  The expression can however have a pejorative meaning, similar to the expression ""le désert français"" (""the French desert"") used to describe a lack of acculturation of the provinces.  Another expression, ""terroir"" is a French term originally used for wine and coffee to denote the special characteristics that geography bestowed upon these products. It can be very loosely translated as ""a sense of place"" which is embodied in certain qualities, and the sum of the effects that the local environment (especially the ""soil"") has had on the growth of the product.  The use of the term has since been generalized to talk about many cultural products.

In addition to its metropolitan territory, France also consists of overseas departments made up of its former colonies of Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana in the Caribbean, and Mayotte and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.  (There also exists a number of ""overseas collectivities"" and ""overseas territories"".  For a full discussion, see administrative divisions of France.  Since 1982, following the French government's policy of decentralisation, overseas departments have elected regional councils with powers similar to those of the regions of metropolitan France. As a result of a constitutional revision which occurred in 2003, these regions are now to be called overseas regions.)  These overseas departments have the same political status as metropolitan departments and are integral parts of France, (similar to the way in which Hawaii is a state and an integral part of the United States), yet they also have specific cultural and linguistic traditions which set them apart.  Certain elements of overseas culture have also been introduced to metropolitan culture (as, for example, the musical form the biguine).

Industrialization, immigration and urbanization in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have also created new socioeconomic regional communities in France, both urban (like Paris, Lyon, Villeurbanne, Lille, Marseille, etc.) and the suburban and working class hinterlands (like Seine-Saint-Denis) of urban agglomerations (called variously banlieues (""suburbs"", sometimes qualified as ""chic"" or ""pauvres"" or les cités ""housing projects"")) which have developed their own ""sense of place"" and local culture (much like the various boroughs of New York City or suburbs of Los Angeles), as well as cultural identity.

Other specific communities
Paris has traditionally been associated with alternative, artistic or intellectual subcultures, many of which involved foreigners. Such subcultures include the ""Bohemians"" of the mid-nineteenth century, the Impressionists, artistic circles of the Belle époque (around such artists as Picasso and Alfred Jarry), the Dadaists, Surrealists, the ""Lost Generation"" (Hemingway, Gertrude Stein) and the post-war ""intellectuals"" associated with Montparnasse (Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir).

France has an estimated 280,000-340,000 Roma, generally known as Gitans, Tsiganes, Romanichels (slightly pejorative), Bohémiens, or Gens du voyage (""travellers"").

There are gay and lesbian communities in the cities, particularly in the Paris metropolitan area (such as in Le Marais district of the capital). Although homosexuality is perhaps not as well tolerated in France as in Spain, Scandinavia, and the Benelux nations, surveys of the French public reveal a considerable shift in attitudes comparable to other Western European nations. , 55% of the French consider homosexuality ""an acceptable lifestyle."" The past mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoë, is gay.
In 2006, an Ipsos survey shows that 62% support same-sex marriage, while 37% were opposed. 55% believed gay and lesbian couples should not have parenting rights, while 44% believe same-sex couples should be able to adopt.
See also LGBT rights in France.

Families and romantic relationships

Household structure
Growing out of the values of the Catholic Church and rural communities, the basic unit of French society was traditionally held to be the family. Over the twentieth century, the ""traditional"" family structure in France has evolved from various regional models (including extended families and nuclear families) to, after World War II, nuclear families.  Since the 1960s, marriages have decreased and divorces have increased in France, and divorce law and legal family status have evolved to reflect these social changes.

According to INSEE figures, household and family composition in metropolitan France continues to evolve.  Most significantly, from 1982 to 1999, single parent families have increased from 3.6% to 7.4%; there have also been increases in the number of unmarried couples, childless couples, and single men (from 8.5% to 12.5) and women (from 16.0% to 18.5%). Their analysis indicates that ""one in three dwellings are occupied by a person living alone; one in four dwellings are occupied by a childless couple..""

Voted by the French Parliament in November 1999 following some controversy, the pacte civil de solidarité (""civil pact of solidarity"") commonly known as a PACS, is a form of civil union between two adults (same-sex or opposite-sex) for organizing their joint life.  It brings rights and responsibilities, but less so than marriage.  From a legal standpoint, a PACS is a ""contract"" drawn up between the two individuals, which is stamped and registered by the clerk of the court.  Individuals who have registered a PACS are still considered ""single"" with regard to family status for some purposes, while they are increasingly considered in the same way as married couples are for other purposes.  While it was pushed by the government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in 1998, it was also opposed, mostly by people on the right-wing who support traditionalist family values and who argued that PACS and the recognition of homosexual unions would be disastrous for French society.

, same-sex marriage is legally recognized in France. Same-sex marriage was an important factor in the presidential election of 2012 between François Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy, who represents the right-wing UMP party, opposed gay marriage, while François Hollande, of the left wing socialist party, supported it. Hollande was elected in May 2012 and his government proposed the law known as ""Mariage pour tous"" (""marriage for all"") to the parliament in November 2012. The law was passed in April 2013 and validated by the Conseil constitutionnel (the constitutional council, tasked with insuring that the new laws passed do not contradict the French constitution) in May 2013. The first French same-sex marriage took place on May 29, 2013 in Montpellier.

Role of the State
The French state has traditionally played an important role in promoting and supporting culture through the educational, linguistic, cultural and economic policies of the government and through its promotion of national identity.  Because of the closeness of this relationship, cultural changes in France are often linked to, or produce, political crisis.

The relationship between the French state and culture is an old one. Under Louis XIII's minister Richelieu, the independent Académie française came under state supervision and became an official organ of control over the French language and seventeenth-century literature. During  Louis XIV's reign, his minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert brought French luxury industries, like textile and porcelain, under royal control and the architecture, furniture, fashion and etiquette of the royal court (particularly at the Château de Versailles)  became the preeminent model of noble culture in France (and, to a great degree, throughout Europe) during the latter half of the seventeenth century.

At times, French state policies have sought to unify the country around certain cultural norms, while at other times they have promoted regional differences within a heterogeneous French identity.  The unifying effect was particularly true of the ""radical period"""" of the French Third Republic which fought regionalisms (including regional languages), supported anti-clericalism and a strict separation of church from state (including education) and actively promoted national identity, thus converting (as the historian Eugen Weber has put it) a ""country of peasants into a nation of Frenchmen"".  The Vichy Regime, on the other hand, promoted regional ""folk"" traditions.

The cultural policies of the (current) French Fifth Republic have been varied, but a consensus seems to exist around the need for preservation of French regionalisms (such as food and language) as long as these don't undermine national identity.  Meanwhile, the French state remains ambivalent over the integration into ""French"" culture of cultural traditions from recent immigrant groups and from foreign cultures, particularly American culture (movies, music, fashion, fast food, language, etc.).  There also exists a certain fear over the perceived loss of French identity and culture in the European system and under American ""cultural hegemony"".

Education

The French educational system is highly centralized. It is divided into three different stages: primary education, or enseignement primaire, corresponding to grade school in the United States; secondary education, or collège and lycée, corresponding to middle and high school in the United States; and higher education (l'université or les Grandes écoles).

Primary and secondary education is predominantly public (private schools also exist, in particular a strong nationwide network of primary and secondary Catholic education), while higher education has both public and private elements. At the end of secondary education, students take the  baccalauréat exam, which allows them to pursue higher education. The baccalauréat pass rate in 2012 was 84.5%.

In 1999–2000, educational spending amounted to 7% of the French GDP and 37% of the national budget.

France's performance in math and science at the middle school level was ranked 23 in the 1995 Trends in International Math and Science Study. France has not participated in later TIMSS studies.

Since the Jules Ferry laws of 1881–2, named after the then Minister of Public Instruction, all state-funded schools, including universities, are independent from the (Roman Catholic) Church. Education in these institutions is free. Non-secular institutions are allowed to organize education as well. The French educational system differs strongly from Northern-European and American systems in that it stresses the importance of partaking in a society as opposed to being responsibly independent.

Secular educational policy has become critical in recent issues of French multiculturalism, as in the ""affair of the Islamic headscarf"".

Minister of Culture

The Minister of Culture is in the Government of France, the cabinet member in charge of national museums and monuments; promoting and protecting the arts (visual, plastic, theatrical, musical, dance, architectural, literary, televisual and cinematographic) in France and abroad; and managing the national archives and regional ""maisons de culture"" (culture centres). The Ministry of Culture is located on the Palais Royal in Paris.

The modern post of Minister of Culture was created by Charles de Gaulle in 1959 and the first Minister was the writer André Malraux.  Malraux was responsible for realizing the goals of the ""droit à la culture"" (""the right to culture"") -- an idea which had been incorporated in the French constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) -- by democratizing access to culture, while also achieving the Gaullist aim of elevating the ""grandeur"" (""greatness"") of post-war France.  To this end, he created numerous regional cultural centres throughout France and actively sponsored the arts.  Malraux's artistic tastes included the modern arts and the avant-garde, but on the whole he remained conservative.

The Ministry of Jacques Toubon was notable for a number of laws (the ""Toubon Laws"") enacted for the preservation of the French language, both in advertisements (all ads must include a French translation of foreign words) and on the radio (40% of songs on French radio stations must be in French), ostensibly in reaction to the presence of English.

Académie française

The Académie française, or the French Academy, is the pre-eminent French learned body on matters pertaining to the French language. The Académie was officially established in 1635 by Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister to King Louis XIII. Suppressed in 1793 during the French Revolution, it was restored in 1803 by Napoleon Bonaparte (the Académie considers itself having been suspended, not suppressed, during the revolution). It is the oldest of the five académies of the Institut de France.

The Académie consists of forty members, known as immortels (immortals). New members are elected by the members of the Académie itself. Académicians hold office for life, but they may be removed for misconduct. The body has the task of acting as an official authority on the language; it is charged with publishing an official dictionary of the language. Its rulings, however, are only advisory; not binding on either the public or the government.

Military service
Until 1996, France had compulsory military service of young men. This has been credited by historians for further promoting a unified national identity and by breaking down regional isolationism.

Labor and employment policy
In France, the first labour laws were Waldeck Rousseau's laws passed in 1884. Between 1936 and 1938 the Popular Front enacted a law mandating 12 days (2 weeks) each year of paid vacation for workers, and a law limiting the work week to 40 hours, excluding overtime. The Grenelle accords negotiated on May 25 and 26th in the middle of the May 1968 crisis, reduced the working week to 44 hours and created trade union sections in each enterprise.<ref>fr:section syndicale d'entreprise December 27, 1968 law</ref> The minimum wage was also increased by 25%. In 2000 Lionel Jospin's government then enacted the 35-hour workweek, down from 39 hours. Five years later, conservative prime minister Dominique de Villepin enacted the New Employment Contract (CNE). Addressing the demands of employers asking for more flexibility in French labour laws, the CNE sparked criticism from trade unions and opponents claiming it was lending favour to contingent work. In 2006 he then attempted to pass the First Employment Contract (CPE) through a vote by emergency procedure, but that it was met by students and unions' protests. President Jacques Chirac finally had no choice but to repeal it.

Healthcare and social welfare
The French are profoundly committed to the public healthcare system (called ""sécurité sociale"") and to their ""pay-as-you-go"" social welfare system.

In 1998, 75% of health payments in France were paid through the public healthcare system. Since 27 July 1999, France has a universal medical coverage for permanent residents in France (stable residence for more than three months). Using five performance indicators to measure health systems in 191 member states, it finds that France provides the best overall health care followed among major countries by Italy, Spain, Oman, Austria and Japan (The World Health Report).

Lifestyle

Food and alcohol

Traditional French culture places a high priority on the enjoyment of food. French cuisine was codified in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier to become the modern version of haute cuisine. Escoffier's major work, however, left out much of the regional character to be found in the provinces of France. Gastro-tourism and the Guide Michelin helped to bring people to the countryside during the 20th century and beyond, to sample this rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of France. Basque cuisine has also been a great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France.

Ingredients and dishes vary by region (see: Regional cuisine). There are many significant regional dishes that have become both national and regional. Many dishes that were once regional, however, have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. Cheese (see: List of French cheeses) and wine (see: French wine) are also a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles both regionally and nationally with their many variations and Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) (regulated appellation) laws, (lentils from Le Puy-en-Velay also have an AOC status). Another French product of special note is the Charolais cattle.

The French typically eat only a simple breakfast (""petit déjeuner"") which consists of coffee, tea or hot chocolate with milk, served traditionally in a large handleless ""bol"" (bowl) and bread or breakfast pastries (croissants). Lunch (""déjeuner"") and dinner (""dîner"") are the main meals of the day. Formal four course meals consist of a starter course (""entrée""), a salad, a main course (""plat principal""), and finally a cheese or dessert course. While French cuisine is often associated with rich desserts, in most homes dessert consists of only fruit or yogurt.

Food shopping in France was formerly done almost daily in small local shops and markets, but the arrival of the supermarket and the even larger ""hypermarchés"" (large-surface distributors) in France have disrupted this tradition. With depopulation of the countryside, many towns have been forced to close shops and markets.

Rates of obesity and heart disease in France have traditionally been lower than in other north-western European countries. This is sometimes called the French paradox (see, for example, Mireille Guiliano's 2006 book French Women Don't Get Fat). French cuisine and eating habits have however come under great pressure in recent years from modern fast food, such as American products and the new global agricultural industry. While French youth culture has gravitated toward fast food and American eating habits (with an attendant rise in obesity), the French in general have remained committed to preserving certain elements of their food culture through such activities as including programs of taste acquisition in their public schools, by the use of the appellation d'origine contrôlée laws, and by state and European subsidies to the French agricultural industry. Emblematic of these tensions is the work of José Bové, who founded in 1987, the Confédération Paysanne, an agricultural union that places its highest political values on humans and the environment, promotes organic farming and opposes genetically modified organisms; Bové's most famous protest was the dismantling of a McDonald's franchise in Millau (Aveyron), in 1999.

In France, cutlery is used in the continental manner (with the fork in the left hand, prongs facing down and the knife in the right hand). French etiquette prohibits the placing of hands below the table and the placing of elbows on it.

The legal drinking age is officially 18 (see: Legal drinking age).

France is one of the oldest wine producing regions of Europe. France now produces the most wine by value in the world (although Italy rivals it by volume and Spain has more land under cultivation for wine grapes). Bordeaux wine, Bourgogne wine and Champagne are important agricultural products.

Tobacco and drugs
The cigarette smoking age is 18 years. According to a widespread cliché, smoking has been part of French culture — actually figures indicate that in terms of consumption per capita, France is only the 60th country out of 121.

France, from 1 February 2007, tightened the existing ban on smoking in public places found in the 1991 Évin law: Law n°91-32 of 10 January, 1991, containing a variety of measures against alcoholism and tobacco consumption.

Smoking is now banned in all public places (stations, museums, etc.); an exception exists for special smoking rooms fulfilling drastic conditions, see below. A special exemption was made for cafés and restaurants, clubs, casinos, bars, etc. which ended, 1 January 2008. Opinion polls suggest 70% of people support the ban. Previously, under the former implementation rules of the 1991 Évin law, restaurants, cafés etc. just had to provide smoking and non-smoking sections, which in practice were often not well separated.

Under the new regulations, smoking rooms are allowed, but are subjected to very strict conditions: they may occupy at most 20% of the total floor space of the establishment and their size may not be more than 35 m²; they need to be equipped with separate ventilation which replaces the full volume of air ten times per hour; the air pressure of the smoking room must constantly be lower than the pressure in the contiguous rooms; they have doors that close automatically; no service can be provided in the smoking rooms; cleaning and maintenance personnel may enter the room only one hour after it was last used for smoking.

Popular French cigarette brands include Gauloises and Marlboro.

The possession, sale and use of cannabis (predominantly Moroccan hashish) is illegal in France.  Since 1 March 1994, the penalties for cannabis use are from two months to a year and/or a fine, while possession, cultivation or trafficking of the drug can be punished much more severely, up to ten years. According to a 1992 survey by SOFRES, 4.7 million French people ages 12–44 have smoked cannabis at least once in their lives.

Sports and hobbies

Football (French: Le Foot) is the most popular sport in France. Other popular sports played in France are rugby union, cycling, tennis, handball, basketball and sailing. France is notable for holding and winning the FIFA World Cup in 1998 and 2018, and holding the annual cycling race Tour de France, and the tennis Grand Slam tournament the French Open. Sport is encouraged in school, and local sports clubs receive financial support from the local governments. While football is definitely the most popular, rugby union and rugby league takes dominance in the southwest, especially around the city of Toulouse (see: Rugby union in France and Rugby league in France).

The modern Olympics was invented in France, in 1894 by Pierre de Coubertin.

Professional sailing in France is centred on singlehanded and shorthanded ocean racing with the pinnacle of this branch of the sport being the Vendée Globe singlehanded around the world race which starts every 4 years from the French Atlantic coast. Other significant events include the Solitaire du Figaro, Mini Transat 6.50, Tour de France a Voile and Route du Rhum transatlantic race. France has been a regular competitor in the America's Cup since the 1970s.

Other important sports include:

 24 Hours of Le Mans - The world's oldest sports car race.
 Skiing - France has an extensive number of ski resorts in the French alps such as Tignes. Ski resorts are also located in the Pyrénées and Vosges mountain chains.
 Pétanque - The international federation is recognized by the IOC.
 Fencing - Fencing leads the list of sports for which gold medals were won for France at the Summer Olympics (see: France at the Olympics).
 Parkour - Developed in France, Parkour is a training discipline with similarities to self-defense or martial arts.
 Babyfoot (table football) - A very popular pastime in bars and homes in France, and the French are the predominant winners of worldwide table football competitions.
 Kitesurfing
 Bullfighting - Spanish style bullfighting is still very popular in the southern part of France.

Like other cultural areas in France, sport is overseen by a government ministry, the Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports (France) which is in charge of national and public sport associations, youth affairs, public sports centers and national stadia (like the Stade de France).

Fashion

Along with Milan, London and New York, Paris is center of an important number of fashion shows. Some of the world's biggest fashion houses (ex: Chanel) have their headquarters in France.

The association of France with fashion () dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV  when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe.

France renewed its dominance of the high fashion ( or ) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great couturier houses, the fashion press (Vogue was founded in 1892; Elle was founded in 1945) and fashion shows.  The first modern Parisian couturier house is generally considered the work of the Englishman Charles Frederick Worth who dominated the industry from 1858 to 1895.  In the early twentieth century, the industry expanded through such Parisian fashion houses as the house of Chanel (which first came to prominence in 1925) and Balenciaga (founded by a Spaniard in 1937).  In the post war year, fashion returned to prominence through Christian Dior's famous ""new look"" in 1947, and through the houses of Pierre Balmain and Hubert de Givenchy (opened in 1952).  In the 1960s, ""high fashion"" came under criticism from France's youth culture while designers like Yves Saint Laurent broke with established high fashion norms by launching prêt-à-porter (""ready to wear"") lines and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing and marketing.  Further innovations were carried out by Paco Rabanne and Pierre Cardin. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established in the 70s and 80s by Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler, Claude Montana, Jean Paul Gaultier and Christian Lacroix.  The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as LVMH.

Since the 1960s, France's fashion industry has come under increasing competition from London, New York, Milan and Tokyo, and the French have increasingly adopted foreign (particularly American) fashions (such as jeans, tennis shoes).  Nevertheless, many foreign designers still seek to make their careers in France.

Pets

In 2006, 52% of French households had at least one pet:  In total, 9.7 million cats, 8.8 million dogs, 2.3 million rodents, 8 million birds, and 28 million fish were kept as pets in France during this year.

Media and art

Art and museums

The first paintings of France are those that are from prehistoric times, painted in the caves of Lascaux well over 10,000 years ago. The arts were already flourishing 1,200 years ago, at the time of Charlemagne, as can be seen in many hand made and hand illustrated books of that time.

Gothic art and architecture originated in France in the 12th century around Paris and then spread to all of Europe. In the 13th century, French craftsmen developed the stained glass painting technique and sophisticated illuminated manuscripts for private devotion in the new gothic style. The final phase of gothic architecture, known as Flamboyant, also began in France in the 15th century before spreading to the rest of Europe.

The 17th century was one of intense artistic achievements : French painting emerged with a distinct identity, moving from Baroque to Classicism. Famous classic painters of the 17th century in France are Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain. French architecture also proved influential with the Palace of Versailles, built for the powerful king Louis XIV, becoming the model of many European royal palaces. During the 18th century the Rococo style emerged as a frivolous continuation of the Baroque style. The most famous painters of the era were Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard. At the end of the century, Jacques-Louis David and Dominique Ingres were the most influential painters of the Neoclassicism.

Géricault and Delacroix were the most important painters of the Romanticism. Afterwards, the painters were more realistic, describing nature (Barbizon school). The realistic movement was led by Courbet and Honoré Daumier. Impressionism was developed in France by artists such as Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Camille Pissarro. At the turn of the century, France had become more than ever the center of innovative art. The Spaniard Pablo Picasso came to France, like many other foreign artists, to deploy his talents there for decades to come. Toulouse-Lautrec, Gauguin and Cézanne were painting then. Cubism is an avant-garde movement born in Paris at the beginning of the 20th century.

The Louvre in Paris is one of the most famous and the largest art museums in the world, created by the new revolutionary regime in 1793 in the former royal palace. It holds a vast amount of art of French and other artists, e.g. the Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, and classical Greek Venus de Milo and ancient works of culture and art from Egypt and the Middle East.

Music

France boasts a wide variety of indigenous folk music, as well as styles played by immigrants from Africa, Latin America and Asia.  In the field of classical music, France has produced a number of notable composers such as Gabriel Fauré, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Hector Berlioz while modern pop music has seen the rise of popular French hip hop, French rock, techno/funk, and turntablists/djs.

The Fête de la Musique was created in France (first held in 1982), a music festival, which has since become celebrated worldwide as world music day. It takes place every June 21, on the first day of summer.

In 2010, the French electronic music duo, Daft Punk was admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight)..

Theater

Cinema

France is the birthplace of cinema and was responsible for many of its early significant contributions: Antoine Lumière realized, on 28 December 1895, the first projection, with the Cinematograph, in Paris. Philippe Binant realized, on 2 February 2000, the first digital cinema projection in Europe, with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments, in Paris. Several important cinematic movements, including the Nouvelle Vague, began in the country.

Additionally, France is an important Francophone film production country. A certain amount of the movies created share international distribution in the western hemisphere thanks to Unifrance. Although French cinema industry is rather small in terms of budget and revenues, it enjoys qualitative screenplay, cast and story telling. French Cinema is often portrayed as more liberal in terms of subjects (Sex, Society, Politics, Historical).  
Within the domestic market, French movies are ranked by the number of admissions. Movies are premiered on Wednesdays.

""Going to the movies"" is a popular activity within metropolitan areas. Many cinema operators offer a ""flat-rate pass"" for approx. €20 per month. Prices per movie range between €5.50 and €10.

French major cinema operators are UGC and Pathé, mainly located in city suburbs due to the number of screens and seating capacity.

Within France many ""small"" cinemas are located in the downtown parts of a city, resisting the big cinema operators nationwide. Paris has the highest density of cinemas (movie theaters) in the world: biggest number of movie theaters per inhabitants, and that in most ""downtown Paris"" movie theaters, foreign movies which would be secluded to ""art houses"" cinemas in other places, are shown alongside ""mainstream"" works as Parisians are avid movie-goers. Proximity of restaurants, accessibility, ambiance and the showing of alternative foreign movies is often cited as being the advantage of these small theaters.

The Cinémathèque Française holds one of the largest archives of films, movie documents and film-related objects in the world. Located in Paris, the Cinémathèque holds daily screenings of films unrestricted by country of origin.

Television

Books, newspapers and magazines

France has the reputation of being a ""literary culture"", and this image is reinforced by such things as the importance of French literature in the French educational system, the attention paid by the French media to French book fairs and book prizes (like the Prix Goncourt, Prix Renaudot or Prix Femina) and by the popular success of the (former) literary television show ""Apostrophes"" (hosted by Bernard Pivot).

Although the official literacy rate of France is 99%, some estimates have placed functional illiteracy at between 10% and 20% of the adult population (and higher in the prison population).

While reading remains a favorite pastime of French youth today, surveys show that it has decreased in importance compared to music, television, sports and other activities.  The crisis of academic publishing has also hit France (see, for example, the financial difficulties of the Presses universitaires de France (PUF), France's premier academic publishing house, in the 1990s).

Literary taste in France remains centered on the novel (26.4% of book sales in 1997), although the French read more non-fiction essays and books on current affairs than the British or Americans.  Contemporary novels, including French translations of foreign novels, lead the list (13% of total books sold), followed by sentimental novels (4.1%), detective and spy fiction  (3.7%), ""classic"" literature (3.5%), science fiction and horror (1.3%) and erotic fiction (0.2%).  About 30% of all fiction sold in France today is translated from English (authors such as William Boyd, John le Carré, Ian McEwan, Paul Auster and Douglas Kennedy are well received).

An important subset of book sales is comic books (typically Franco-Belgian comics like The Adventures of Tintin and Astérix) which are published in a large hardback format; comic books represented 4% of total book sales in 1997.  French artists have made the country a leader in the graphic novel genre and France hosts the Angoulême International Comics Festival, Europe's preeminent comics festival.

Like other areas of French culture, book culture is influenced, in part, by the state, in particular by the ""Direction du livre et de la lecture"" of the Ministry of Culture, which oversees the ""Centre national du livre"" (National Book Center).  The French Ministry of Industry also plays a role in price control.  Finally, the VAT for books and other cultural products in France is at the reduced rate of 5.5%, which is also that of food and other necessities (see here).

In terms of journalism in France, the regional press (see list of newspapers in France) has become more important than national dailies (such as Le Monde and Le Figaro) over the past century: in 1939, national dailies were 2/3 of the dailies market, while today they are less than 1/4.  The magazine market is currently dominated by TV listings magazines followed by news magazines such as L'Obs, L'Express and Le Point.

Architecture and housing

Transportation

There are significant differences in lifestyles with respect to transportation between very urbanized regions such as Paris, and smaller towns and rural areas. In Paris, and to a lesser extent in other major cities, many households do not own an automobile and simply use efficient public transport. The cliché about the Parisien is rush hour in the Métro subway. However, outside of such areas, ownership of one or more cars is standard, especially for households with children.

The TGV high-speed rail network, train à grande vitesse is a fast rail transport which serves several areas of the country and is self-financing. There are plans to reach most parts of France and many other destinations in Europe in coming years. Rail services to major destinations are punctual and frequent.

Holidays

Despite the principles of laïcité and the separation of church from state, public and school holidays in France generally follow the Roman Catholic religious calendar (including Easter, Christmas, Ascension Day, Pentecost, Assumption of Mary, All Saints Day, etc.). Labor Day and the National Holiday are the only business holidays determined by government statute; the other holidays are granted by convention collective (agreement between employers' and employees' unions) or by agreement of the employer.

The five holiday periods of the public school year are:
 the vacances de la Toussaint (All Saints Day) - two weeks starting near the end of October.
 the vacances de Noël (Christmas) - two weeks, ending after New Years.
 the vacances d'hiver (winter) - two weeks in February and March.
 the vacances de printemps (spring), formerly vacances de Pâques (Easter) - two weeks in April and May.
 the vacances d'été (summer), or grandes vacances (literally: big holidays) - two months in July and August.

On May 1, Labour Day (La Fête du Travail) the French give flowers of Lily of the Valley (Le Muguet) to one another.

The National holiday (called Bastille Day in English) is on the 14 of July.  Military parades, called Défilés du 14 juillet, are held, the largest on the Champs-Élysées avenue in Paris in front of the President of the Republic.

On November 2, All Souls Day (La Fête des morts), the French traditionally bring chrysanthemums to the tombs of departed family members.

On November 11, Remembrance Day (Le Jour de la Commémoration or L' Armistice) is an official holiday.

Christmas is generally celebrated in France on Christmas Eve by a traditional meal (typical dishes include oysters, boudin blanc and the bûche de Noël), by opening presents and by attending the midnight mass (even among Catholics who do not attend church at other times of the year).

Candlemas (La Chandeleur) is celebrated with crêpes. The popular saying is that if the cook can flip a crêpe singlehandedly with a coin in the other hand, the family is assured of prosperity throughout the coming year.

The Celtic holiday Halloween, which is popular throughout the English speaking world, has grown in popularity following its introduction in the mid-1990s by the trade associations.  The growth seems to have stalled during the following decade.

Conventions
 France is the home of the International System of Units (the metric system). Some pre-metric units are still used, essentially the livre (a unit of weight equal to half a kilogram) and the quintal (a unit of weight equal to 100 kilograms).
 In mathematics, France uses the infix notation like most countries. For large numbers the long scale is used. Thus, the French use the word billion for the number 1,000,000,000,000, which in countries using short scale is called a trillion. However, there exists a French word, milliard, for the number 1,000,000,000, which in countries using the short scale is called a billion. Thus, despite the use of the long scale, one billion is called un milliard (""one milliard"") in French, and not mille millions (""one thousand million""). It should also be noted that names of numbers above the milliard are rarely used. Thus, one trillion will most often be called mille milliards (""one thousand milliard"") in French, and rarely un billion.
 In the French numeral notation, the comma (,) is the decimal separator, whereas a space is used between each group of three digits (fifteen million five hundred thousand and thirty-two should be written as 15 500 032). In finance, the currency symbol is used as a decimal separator or put after the number. For example, €25,048.05 is written either 25 048€05 or 25 048,05 € (always with an extra space between the figure and the currency symbol).
 In computing, a bit is called a bit yet a byte is called an octet (from the Latin root octo, meaning ""8""). SI prefixes are used.
 24-hour clock time is used, with h being the separator between hours and minutes (for example 2:30 pm is 14h30).
 The all-numeric form for dates is in the order day-month-year, using a slash as the separator (example: 31/12/1992 or 31/12/92).

Problem in defining ""French"" culture

Wherever one comes from, ""culture"" consists of beliefs and values learned through the socialization process as well as material artifacts.Hoult, T. F, ed. 1969. Dictionary of Modern Sociology, p. 93. ""Culture is the learned set of beliefs, values, norms and material goods shared by group members. Culture consists of everything we learn in groups during the life course-from infancy to an old age.""

The conception of ""French"" culture however poses certain difficulties and presupposes a series of assumptions about what precisely the expression ""French"" means.  Whereas American culture posits the notion of the ""melting-pot"" and cultural diversity, the expression ""French culture"" tends to refer implicitly to a specific geographical entity (as, say, ""metropolitan France"", generally excluding its overseas departments) or to a specific historico-sociological group defined by ethnicity, language, religion and geography. The realities of ""Frenchness"" however, are extremely complicated. Even before the late 18th-19th century, ""metropolitan France"" was largely a patchwork of local customs and regional differences that the unifying aims of the Ancien Régime and the French Revolution had only begun to work against, and today's France remains a nation of numerous indigenous and foreign languages, of multiple ethnicities and religions, and of regional diversity that includes French citizens in Corsica, Guadeloupe, Martinique and elsewhere around the globe also in America.

The creation of some sort of typical or shared French culture or ""cultural identity"", despite this vast heterogeneity, is the result of powerful internal forces — such as the French educational system, mandatory military service, state linguistic and cultural policies — and by profound historic events — such as the Franco-Prussian war and the two World Wars — which have forged a sense of national identity over the last 200 years. However, despite these unifying forces, France today still remains marked by social class and by important regional differences in culture (cuisine, dialect/accent, local traditions) that many fear will be unable to withstand contemporary social forces (depopulation of the countryside, immigration, centralization, market forces and the world economy).

In recent years, to fight the loss of regional diversity, many in France have promoted forms of multiculturalism and encouraged cultural enclaves (communautarisme), including reforms on the preservation of regional languages and the decentralization of certain government functions, but French multiculturalism has had a harder time of accepting, or of integrating into the collective identity, the large non-Christian and immigrant communities and groups that have come to France since the 1960s.

The last 70 years has also seen French cultural identity ""threatened"" by global market forces and by American ""cultural hegemony"". Since its dealings with the 1943 GATT free trade negotiations, France has fought for what it calls the exception culturelle, meaning the right to subsidize or treat favorably domestic cultural production and to limit or control foreign cultural products (as seen in public funding for French cinema or the lower VAT accorded to books).  The notion of an explicit exception française however has angered many of France's critics.

The French are often perceived as taking a great pride in national identity and the positive achievements of France (the expression ""chauvinism"" is of French origin) and cultural issues are more integrated in the body of the politics than elsewhere (see ""The Role of the State"", below). The French Revolution claimed universalism for the democratic principles of the Republic. Charles de Gaulle actively promoted a notion of French ""grandeur"" (""greatness"").  Perceived declines in cultural status are a matter of national concern and have generated national debates, both from the left (as seen in the anti-globalism of José Bové) and from the right and far right (as in the discourses of the National Front).

According to Hofstede's Framework for Assessing Culture, the culture of France is moderately individualistic and high Power Distance Index.

Now, the interracial blending of some native French and newcomers stands as a vibrant and boasted feature of French culture, from popular music to movies and literature. Therefore, alongside mixing of populations, exists also a cultural blending (le métissage culturel) that is present in France. It may be compared to the traditional US conception of the melting-pot. The French culture might have been already blended in from other races and ethnicities, in cases of some biographical research on the possibility of African ancestry on a small number of famous French citizens. Author Alexandre Dumas, père possessed one-fifth black Haitian descent, and Empress Josephine Napoleon who was born and raised in the French West Indies from a plantation estate family.
We can mention as well, the most famous French-Canadian singer Celine Dion whose grandmother was a North African from Kabylie.

For a long time, the only objection to such outcomes predictably came from the far-left schools of thought. In the past few years, other unexpected voices are however beginning to question what they interpret, as the new philosopher Alain Finkielkraut coined the term, as an ""Ideology of miscegenation"" (une idéologie du métissage) that may come from what one other philosopher, Pascal Bruckner, defined as The Tears of the White Man (le sanglot de l'homme blanc). These critics have been dismissed by the mainstream and their propagators have been labelled as new reactionaries (les nouveaux réactionnaires), even if racist and anti-immigration sentiment has recently been documented to be increasing in France at least according to one poll.

"History of landscape architecture

The discussion of the history of landscape architecture is a complex endeavor as it shares much of its history with that of landscape gardening and architecture, spanning the entirety of man's existence.  However, it was not until relatively recent history that the term ""landscape architecture"" or even ""landscape architect"" came into common use.

Early history

For the period before 1800, the history of landscape architecture, formally landscape gardening, is largely that of master planning and garden design for manor houses, palaces and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by André Le Nôtre for King Louis XIV of France at the Palace of Versailles. 

The first person to write of ""making"" a landscape was Joseph Addison in a series of essays entitled ""On the Pleasures of the Imagination"" in 1712

The term landscape architecture was first used by Gilbert Laing Meason in his book On The Landscape Architecture of the Great Painters of Italy (London, 1828). Meason was born in Scotland and did not have the opportunity to visit Italy, but he admired the relationship between architecture and landscape in the great landscape paintings and drew upon Vitruvius' Ten Books on Architecture to find principles and the relationship between built form and natural form. The term was then taken up by John Claudius Loudon and used to describe a specific type of architecture, suited to being placed in designed landscapes. Loudon was admired by the American designer and theorist Andrew Jackson Downing and landscape architecture was the subject of a chapter in Downing's book A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening, Adapted to North America (1841).

First years
 
This led to its adoption by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Olmsted and a man named George Oskar gave a different slant to the meaning of 'landscape architecture', using the term to describe the whole professional task of designing a composition of planting, landform, water, paving and other structures. Their first use of the term was in the winning entry for the design of Central Park in New York City. Olmsted and Vaux then in 1863 adopted landscape architect as a professional title and used it to describe their work for the planning of urban park systems. Olmsted's project for the Emerald Necklace in Boston was widely admired and led to the use of landscape architect as a professional title in Europe, initially by Patrick Geddes and Thomas Mawson. Frederick Law Olmsted and Beatrix Farrand, with eight other leading practitioners

Modern time

Landscape architect has since become a worldwide profession, submitted for recognition by the International Labour Organization and represented on a world-wide basis by the International Federation of Landscape Architects. 

Garrett Eckbo and Dan Kiley were prominent modernist landscape architects in the mid-20th century. Their work is represented by a shift away from what might be termed the wild garden aesthetic of earlier landscape architects influenced by Romantic Naturalism, and toward a more spare and rectilinear aesthetic. Both studied under Warren Manning at Harvard, who in turn had studied under Frederick Law Olmsted.

Several landscape architects practicing in the 1980s and 1990s moved the discipline beyond its roots in High Modernism.  These include Martha Schwartz, Peter Walker, and Michael Van Valkenburgh. Starting in the mid-1990s, a new disciplinary shift occurred toward what has been called Landscape urbanism, a term that attempts to merge urban design, infrastructure design and landscape.

Publications 
Three remarkable histories of the landscape architecture profession were published in the 1970s.

A first comprehensive history of landscape architecture, as distinct from the history of gardening was written by Norman T Newton with the title Design on the land: the development of landscape architecture (Belknap/Harvard 1971). The book has 42 chapters. The first three chapters are on Ancient Times, The Middle Ages, and The World of Islam. The last three chapters are on Urban Open-Space Systems, Variations in Professional Practice and the Conservation of Natural Resources. This reflects the development of landscape architecture from a focus on private gardens, in the ancient world, to a focus on the planning and design of public open space in the modern world. Since kings used to be responsible for the provision of public goods (irrigation, streets, town walls, parks and other environmental goods) the distinction between public and private was not quite the same in the ancient world as it is in the modern world.

A second comprehensive history of landscape architecture with the title History of Landscape Architecture was published in 1973 by George B Tobey. It extends from 5000 BC, through the development of agriculture and towns to the design of gardens, parks and garden cities. This represents a broader view of landscape architecture than that of Newton and would have been well suited to Newton's title 'Design on the land'.

A third comprehensive history of landscape architecture was published by Geoffrey and Susan Jellicoe in 1975 with the title The landscape of man: shaping the environment from prehistory to the present day (Thames and Hudson, 1975). The book has 27 chapters and is more comprehensive than its predecessors, geographically, artistically and philosophically. Like Bannister Fletcher's History of Architecture, the book has introductory sections (e.g. on environment, social history, philosophy, expression, architecture, landscape) and then a series of examples with plans and photographs. Many of the examples are parks and gardens but the book also includes the layout of temples, towns, forests and other projects concerned with 'shaping the environment'.

Related fine arts and representation
The fine arts and landscape architecture have been interwoven in the outstanding professionals' methods. A history of landscape architecture, including the natural and designed the landscape and of public and private gardens: also includes the crucial professional component of artistic and technical representation, which have always been responsible for visualizing and communicating – the creative concepts, ideas, designs, options, 'manifested theories', and guiding aesthetic principles – between the landscape architect and the clients, builders, and interested parties.

A few of the media and methods are unchanged, while most have evolved over the centuries to reflect new artistic methods and graphic supplies. Almost timeless are the fine arts media of charcoal sketch, oil paint, watercolor, pen and ink drawing, sculpture, and etching. Those were joined by: print-making; by film photography for prints, slides, and movies; collage and built up layered images; model making, and other techniques. Since the late 20th century the introduction of computers, numerous formatting uses for scanning and printing, the wide array of options with digital technology for drawing, images and site videos; and the nearly infinite reach of the internet have revolutionized how to explore and interact to share creative intent. These have also facilitated effective communicating collaboratively within the project team, clients, and involved people the world.

"Abandonment cost

Abandonment costs or Abandonment expenditure (ABEX) are costs associated with the abandonment of a business venture. 

Abandonment costs traditionally applied to the process of abandoning an under-producing or non-producing oil or gas well. In that context, it means the removal of equipment, plugging of the well with cement, any environmental clean-up, etc. necessary to shut the well down. It is occasionally referred to as ""Removal and Abandonment"" or R & A. The objective of well abandonment is to ensure that no hydrocarbons leak into surface water or into the atmosphere.  The cost of a routine abandonment of a typical well in the United States is about $5,000 (~Texas average cost in year 2000). If a well has developed a leak that allows gas to flow up the outside of the well casing, finding and correcting the leak can push the cost of abandonment beyond $100,000. Wells that have been used as injectors or have been subject to fracking operation are more likely to develop leaks because the injected substances can create channels that permit uncontrolled flow outside the casing. 

The term's application has been broadened from its original context to apply to the abandonment of other business ventures, primarily in manufacturing. It is often used in a cost-benefit analysis to determine if a marginal venture should be continued or if it is more financially beneficial to abandon the venture and plow the remaining money into something else in an attempt to recoup the losses. For example, General Motors had some abandonment costs from shutting down the Pontiac and Saturn brands. The existence of abandonment costs in an industry implies that there is no free exit from that industry.

"Leary v. United States

Leary v. United States, 395 U.S. 6 (1969), is a U.S. Supreme Court case dealing with the constitutionality of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937. Timothy Leary, a professor and activist, was arrested for the possession of marijuana in violation of the Marihuana Tax Act. Leary challenged the act on the ground that the act required self-incrimination, which violated the Fifth Amendment. The unanimous opinion of the court was penned by Justice John Marshall Harlan II and declared the Marihuana Tax Act unconstitutional. Thus, Leary's conviction was overturned. Congress responded shortly thereafter by replacing the Marihuana Tax Act with the newly written Controlled Substances Act while continuing the prohibition of certain drugs in the United States.

Facts that triggered the dispute
The circumstances surrounding the petitioner's conviction were as follows. On December 20, 1965, Leary left New York by automobile, intending to take a vacation trip to the Mexican state of Yucatán. He was accompanied by his daughter and son, both teenagers, and two others. On December 22, 1965, the party drove across the International Bridge between the United States and Mexico at Laredo, Texas. They stopped at the Mexican customs station and, after apparently being denied entry, drove back across the bridge. They halted at the American secondary inspection area, explained the situation to a customs inspector, and stated that they had nothing from Mexico to declare. The inspector asked to search the car, examined its interior, and saw what appeared to be marijuana seeds on the floor. Small amounts of marijuana were also found on the car floor and in the glove compartment. A personal search of Leary's daughter revealed a silver snuff box containing semi-refined marijuana and three partially smoked marijuana cigarettes. Though Leary was arrested for violating the Marijuana Tax Act, it was also illegal in the state of Texas to possess marijuana. Hence, compliance under federal law would have provided self-incriminating evidence.

Legal reasoning of the court

a. If read according to its terms, the Marijuana Tax Act compelled petitioner to expose himself to a ""real and appreciable"" risk of self-incrimination;
b. [The statute] required him, in the course of obtaining an order form, to identify himself not only as a transferee of marijuana but as a transferee who had not registered and paid the occupational tax;
c. Compliance with the transfer tax provisions would have required petitioner unmistakably to identify himself as a member of [a]...""selective"" and ""suspect"" group, we can only decide that when read according to their terms these provisions created a ""real and appreciable"" hazard of incrimination.

Later development

The Marihuana Tax Act ultimately was repealed by the U.S. Congress in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.

"Bayume Mohamed Husen

Bayume Mohamed Husen (born Mahjub bin Adam Mohamed; 22 February 1904 – 24 November 1944) was the son of a former askari officer and served together with his father in World War I with German colonial troops in East Africa. Later, he worked as a waiter on a German shipping line and was able to move to Germany in 1929. He married and started a family in January 1933. Husen supported the German neo-colonialist movement and contributed to the Deutsche Afrika-Schau, a former human zoo used by Nazi political propagandists. Husen worked as a waiter and in various minor jobs in language tutoring and in smaller roles in various Africa-related German film productions. In 1941, he was imprisoned in the KZ Sachsenhausen, where he died in 1944. His Afro-German life was the subject of a 2007 biography and a 2014 documentary film.

Background 

Husen was born in Dar es Salaam, then part of German East Africa, as the son of an askari who held the rank of Effendi. Prior to World War I, he had already learned German and worked as a clerk at a textile factory in Lindi. When war broke out in 1914, both he and his father joined the Schutztruppe and participated in the East African campaign against Allied forces. Husen was wounded in the Battle of Mahiwa in October 1917 and held as a POW by British forces.

After the War, Husen worked as a ""boy(servant)"" on various cruise ships and worked as a waiter with a Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie ship in 1925. In 1929, he travelled to Berlin to collect outstanding military pay for himself and his father, but his claims were rejected by the Foreign Office as too late. Husen stayed in Berlin and worked as a waiter. He used his Swahili in language courses for officials and security personnel and as a low paid tutor in university classes, e.g. for the famous scholar, Diedrich Westermann.

He married a Sudeten German woman, Maria Schwandner, on January 27, 1933, three days before Hitler came to power. The couple had a son, Ahmed Adam Mohamed Husen (1933–1938), and a daughter, Annemarie (1936–1939). Husen had another son, Heinz Bodo Husen (1933–1945), from another relationship with a German woman named Lotta Holzkamp – this child was adopted by Schwandner and raised with his half-siblings.

Role in the German neo-colonialist movement 
In 1934, Husen applied without success for the ""Frontkämpfer-Abzeichen"", the front-line veterans' Honour Cross. The German authorities were not willing to bestow the order upon ""coloureds"" in general, and Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck appeared to have explicitly ruled out the case of Husen in a letter to the foreign office. Husen nevertheless wore the badge and an askari uniform which he probably bought from a military supplies dealer during his participation in rallies of the German neo-colonialist movement, which sought to reclaim Germany's lost colonies.

Whether he had received or lost German citizenship at all is not clear. It was common practice in Weimar Germany to provide migrants from the former German colonies with a passport carrying an endorsement ""Deutscher Schutzbefohlener“ (German Protegee) which didn't give them full citizenship. After Hitler's rise to power, black Germans from the former colonies were often deemed to be nationals of the state that had succeeded Germany as the relevant colonial power under the Treaty of Versailles.  As in the case of Hans Massaquoi, there was no level of discrimination against black Germans comparable to the systematic hatred the Jewish minority faced.

Various assignments in Nazi Germany 
In 1934, Husen briefly returned to Tanganyika during the production of the film Die Reiter von Deutsch-Ostafrika, in which he had a minor role. Thereafter, Husen lost his main income as a waiter in the Haus Vaterland pleasure palace in 1935 after being dismissed due to racialist complaints by two co-workers. He allegedly also had ongoing conflicts with the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Seminar für Orientalische Sprachen in Berlin, where he had helped to teach Swahili to police officers being readied for service in the regained German colonies after the anticipated war would end in German victory, or even in the event of an unlikely reversal of the colonial clauses of the Treaty of Versailles.

In 1936, Husen joined the Deutsche Afrika-Schau, a sort of human zoo created by the German Foreign Office as part of a campaign for the return of the former German colonies. The Foreign Office wanted to use the Afro-Germans to argue against foreign claims that doubted Nazi Germany's ability to administer colonies. Other parts of the Nazi regime tried to use foreign colonial troops during the Occupation of the Rhineland and the Battle of France as a propaganda tool. In 1940, the show was stopped due to the war.

After the British and French declaration of war against Germany in 1939, Husen asked to be accepted in the Wehrmacht but his admission was denied. From 1939 to 1941, Husen appeared in at least 23 German films, generally as an extra or in minor speaking roles. His last and most prominent role was that of Ramasan, the native guide of German colonial leader Carl Peters in the 1941 film of the same name. He stopped working for the university in April 1941, allegedly after being mistreated by Martin Heepe, an Africanist and linguistic expert. While on set, he engaged in an affair with a German woman and was reported to the authorities.

Husen was arrested by the Gestapo on a charge of racial defilement and detained without trial in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp where he died in 1944.

Legacy 
A 2007 biography by Marianne Bechhaus-Gerst made Husen's life known to a wider German public, and the artist Gunter Demnig installed a ""stolperstein"" memorial stone for Husen in front of his former apartment in Berlin. His life is the subject of the 2014 documentary film, Majubs Reise by Eva Knopf.

"Emanuel Driggus

Emanuel Driggus (surname was possibly derived from Rodriguez) (b. c. 1620s-d. 1673) and his wife Frances were Atlantic Creole slaves in the mid-seventeenth century in Virginia, of the Chesapeake Bay Colony. They first appear in a record of sale in 1640 to Captain Francis Potts; at the time they arranged for a contract of limited indenture for their two children in service. The Driggus couple had other children, who were born into slavery. In 1657, Captain Potts sold two of their children, Thomas and Ann Driggus, to pay off some personal debt.

Driggus was freed after the death of Potts in 1658. By then he was a widower and had remarried, but he continued to provide for the enslaved children from his first marriage. He bequeathed a horse to his daughters Francy and Jane before his death in 1673.  
 
His son Thomas Driggus eventually married a free black woman; because she was free, their children were born free.  According to the principle of partus sequitur ventrem, adopted into Virginia law in 1662, children born in the colony took the status of their mother. This principle, which contributed to the expansion of chattel slavery, was widely adopted by other colonies and incorporated into state laws after the American Revolutionary War.

"Outline of human sexuality

The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to human sexuality:

Human sexuality is the capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. Human sexuality can also refer to the way one person is sexually attracted to another person of the opposite sex (heterosexuality), the same sex (homosexuality), or having both tendencies (bisexuality). The lack of sexual attraction is referred to as asexuality. Human sexuality impacts cultural, political, legal and philosophical aspects of life, as well as being widely connected to issues of morality, ethics, theology, spirituality, or religion. It is not, however, directly tied to gender.

"Barnes, Sunderland

Barnes is an inner suburb in the southwest of Sunderland in northeast England, situated about a mile from the city centre. The area is split into Barnes, which lies towards the east, and High Barnes, which lies around Barnes Park and the Bede Sixth Form Centre of City of Sunderland College.  Barnes is bounded by Chester Road to the north, Durham Road on the south, Springwell Road to the west and the city centre to the east. However, these boundaries are not officially set; views vary as to where the area begins and ends. The population of this ward taken at the 2011 Census was 10,987.

There are two churches in the vicinity of High Barnes, Ewesley Road Methodist Church and St. Gabriel's Church.

History

The land that is now Barnes was once owned by the Bishop of Durham and was little more than fields in the Middle Ages. Over the years it has been owned by several families: firstly the Daltons, then the Bowes, then the Ettricks and finally, the Pembertons (these four families are now the names of the four houses in Barnes Junior School). The Ettrick family mansion, situated to the north of the modern day park on the hill overlooking the surrounding area, was the centre of the estate. The mansion house fell into disrepair and was demolished in the mid-19th century.  Formerly Little Sisters of The Poor operated a Catholic care home, built in the late 19th century, on the site; it dominates the area.  The Nuns relinquished the very large building in 2013 when the number of inhabitants dropped to twenty; the care home has been taken over by St Cuthbert's Care and continues to operate. The Pemberton family appear to have taken over the estate's ownership in the mid-19th century and lived in a red-brick mansion house called 'The Barnes' situated in what is now the lower bowling green areas of the park; 'The Barnes' house itself survived until 1921 when it was demolished to make way for the bowling greens. It was approached by two avenues of Dutch Elms; most of the trees have long since died, however the grand avenue remains as the path from the A690 Durham Road entrance to the park.   During World War II, several houses in Colchester Terrace were destroyed in the blitzkrieg.
No evidence of this damage remains, however it can be seen that the houses change in style from two-storey 1920s-built terrace houses to cottage style houses.

Politics

Since the creation of Barnes ward in 2004, the ward has been a marginal one, with a mixture of Conservative and Labour councillors. As of 2019, Barnes has two Conservative councillors and one Labour.

Transport

Barnes is well served by buses on Chester and Durham Roads, with frequent services to the city centre, as well as Newcastle upon Tyne, Durham, Consett and Washington. Services also exist for Herrington, Silksworth, Farringdon and Hastings Hill. Aside from the main bus lanes, the 5/5A and the 35 services provide a service to the town centre from Ormonde Street and Barnes Park. Barnes has no metro station, but Pallion, Millfield and University stations are within walking distance.

Barnes Park

The Barnes is most notable for its historic public space, Barnes Park. Opened in 1908, the park is a key part of Sunderland's heritage.. In 2009, following a successful lottery grant bid, the park was given a £2.4 million regeneration.

"Stillman Witt

Stillman Witt (January 4, 1808 — April 29, 1875) was an American railroad and steel industry executive best known for building the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad, Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad, and the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad. Through his banking activities, he played a significant role in the early years of the Standard Oil company. He was also one of the founding investors in the Cleveland Rolling Mill, a major steel firm in the United States.

Early life
Witt was born January 4, 1808, in Worcester, Massachusetts, to John and Hannah ( Foster) Witt. His family was poor, and he had little education.

The Witts moved to Troy, New York, when Stillman was 13 years old. John Witt ran a tavern on the halfway point between Troy and Albany, New York. Stillman obtained a job earning $10 a month paddling a skiff ferry across the Hudson River. Canvass White, an engineer and inventor, frequently rode the ferry, and became impressed with Stillman's attentiveness, attitude, and drive. After obtaining John Witt's permission, White apprenticed the boy as an engineer and accountant. To augment his apprenticeship, he took lessons at night in accounting and bookkeeping.

Early career

About 1826, White sent Witt to work for the Cohoes Company in Cohoes, New York. White and others founded the firm in 1826. In 1831, the Cohoes Company built a wooden dam across the Mohawk River above Cohoes Falls and later would construct six canals to provide hydropower to various mills, factories, and foundries in Cohoes. Witt went to work as paymaster for the Cohoes Company, although the date of his arrival is not known. Some sources claim that Witt helped to construct the dam and the six power canals, as well as platted the emerging village of Cohoes. If he did so, then it was under the supervision of Hugh White, the brother of Canvass (who had assumed construction supervisory duties, as Canvass White was too busy). Canvass White turned over operation of the Cohoes Company to Hugh White in 1830, before work on the dam began. Canvass White died in 1834, before work on the power canals began.

Witt then went to work as a paymaster and engineer for the Juniata Bridge Company on the Clark's Ferry Bridge in Duncannon, Pennsylvania. Work began on the bridge, which spanned the Juniata River just before its confluence with the Susquehanna River, in 1939 and was completed later that year.

Unclear work history
Witt then traveled to Kentucky, where he was to work on the Louisville and Portland Canal. Sources vary considerably as to the next sequence of events. Two sources say Witt spent 18 months there, but did not finish the work and so returned to Albany. Maurice Joblin, however, says he fell ill shortly after arriving in Kentucky, and returned to Albany for 13 months of recuperation. The New York Times said Witt completed work on the canal (although it did not say how long that took) and then returned to Albany. If Witt worked on the canal, it seems unlikely that he spent much time there. The canal had been completed in December 1830, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers records almost no work done on the canal between 1830 and 1848 (when Witt is known to have been in Cleveland).

The next sequence of events is even cloudier. According to business biographer James W. Campbell, Witt next became an agent for the Hudson River Steamboat Association. Railway Age claimed he was a manager, while The New York Times said he went to work for the People's Line. Joblin, however, says that Witt first captained the James Farley, a steamboat on the Erie Canal, for an unspecified period of time. Witt then captained the Hudson River steamboat Novelty for two or three years, before being hired as a manager by the Hudson River Steamboat Association. Joblin claims he remained with the group until it dissolved in 1841.

Early railroading
About 1840 or 1841, Witt took a managerial position with the Western Railroad.  Witt's position has been variously reported as ""general manager"", ""manager"", ""general freight agent"", and ""agent"". The Western Railroad itself referred to Witt as a ""superintendent"" in April 1842, and as an ""agent"" in 1849. Whatever the scope of his duties, sources agree that Witt was stationed at Albany, and during his tenure oversaw the construction of the depot at East Greenbush (now a suburb of Albany). According to Joblin, Witt spent seven-and-a-half years working for the railroad.

Career in Cleveland

Cleveland, Columbus & Cincinnati Railroad

By the late 1840s, Stillman Witt was well known as a manager and railroad builder. From 1840 to 1843, Frederick Harbach had worked as an assistant engineer on the Western Railroad, and the two men became acquainted. Witt also worked with Amasa Stone, who at that time was active constructing railroad bridges throughout New England. Stone, too, became acquainted with Harbach.

The three men became involved with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad (CC&C). The CC&C was chartered in 1836, but for various reasons did not begin construction on the road for more than a decade. In 1847, Harbach left Massachusetts to accept an appointment at the CC&C as chief surveyor of the road. In November 1848, the company finally issued a request for proposals to build the first leg of its line from Cleveland to Columbus, Ohio. Alfred Kelley, an attorney and former state legislator, canal commissioner, banker, and railroad builder, was president of the railway, and he, too, knew Stone well from his railroading days in the east. Kelley and the CC&C managers reached out to Harbach, Stone, and Witt, and asked them to bid on the project. The three men formed a company in late 1848 to bid on the contract, which they then won. Construction began on the line in November 1849, and the final spike was driven on February 18, 1851. Harbach, Stone, and Witt agreed to take a portion of their pay in the form of stock in the railroad. The stock soared in value as soon as the spur was completed, making the three men very wealthy.

Witt was first named a director of the CC&C in 1856, a position he held until 1868. He was elected vice president of the firm as well in June 1863, a position he also held until 1868.

On May 16, 1868, the CC&C merged with the Bellefontaine Railway to form the Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway (CCC&I). Witt was elected a director and vice president of the new company, a position he held until his death in 1875.

Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad
Witt next became involved with the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad (CP&A). On February 18, 1848, the CP&A received a state charter to build a line from Cleveland to join the Franklin Canal Railroad, whose line ran from Erie, Pennsylvania, to the Ohio border. Alfred Kelley was a director of the CP&A, and on July 26, 1850, the CP&A awarded a contract to build its  line to the firm of Harbach, Stone, and Witt. The line was completed in autumn 1852. Once more Witt and his partners took a large portion of their pay in the form of stock, which made them very rich.

Witt was first elected a director of the CP&A in 1853, a position he held until 1869. He was elected vice president of the company as well in 1859, and held that position 1868.

The CP&A had a close working relationship with the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railway, and in 1860 Witt was elected to the Michigan Southern's board of directors. He held this position at least through 1864.

The CP&A merged with the Michigan Southern & Northern Indiana Railroad in May 1869 to form the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (LS&MS). Witt was elected a director of the new company, a position he held until his death in 1875.

Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad

In 1849, Harbach, Stone, and Witt won a contract to build the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad (B&I). The Indiana portion of the line was finished in 1852, and the Ohio portion in July 1853. Witt was elected a director of the B&I in July 1853, a position he held until 1865. He was named to the board's executive committee in 1861 and 1862.

Witt was elected a director of the Indianapolis, Pittsburgh and Cleveland Railroad (IPCR) in 1856 after the B&I's sister railroad in Indiana, the Indianapolis and Bellefontaine Railroad, entered into a joint operating agreement with the IPCR on March 14, 1856.

John Brough, a newspaper publisher and president of the Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, was elected the B&I's president in 1862. Witt encouraged Brough to run for Governor of Ohio in 1864. Knowing that Brough could not afford the large reduction in pay, Witt agreed to become president of the B&I and forward his salary to Brough. Brough gave his assent, and continued to receive the income from Witt until Brough's death on August 29, 1865. Brough became one of the greatest ""war governors"" of the American Civil War.

Witt was elected president of the B&I after Brough died in September 1865, and held that position until the B&I merged with the CCC&I on May 16, 1868.

Other railroads
Frederick Harbach died of a heart attack in February 1851, but Stone and Witt kept the construction firm going.

In December 1853, Stone and Witt won a contract from the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad to build a  line from Chicago to the Illinois-Wisconsin border. This work consisted of two contracts. The first was to clear and grade the line, and the second was to build the track. This latter work was not finished until 1858. Once more, both men took a significant portion of their pay in stock, and when the stock rose in value they became wealthy. Stone and Witt actually managed operations on a portion of the Chicago & Milwaukee for some time, and Witt was elected to the road's board of directors in 1867.

In 1868, Witt, Stone, and Cleveland businessmen Hiram Garrettson and Jeptha Wade invested in and constructed the Cleveland and Newburgh Railroad. This steam streetcar line cost $68,000 ($ in  dollars) to build, and ran for  down Willson Avenue (now East 55th Street) and then Kinsman Road to the Village of Newburgh (now the southwest corner of the Union-Miles Park neighborhood). Witt was a director of the line in 1874.

In 1868, Witt was elected a director of both the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad and the Indianapolis and St. Louis Railroad.

Witt was elected president of the Valley Railway in 1874, and was still serving in this position at the time of his death the following year. That same year, he was elected a director of the Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad, and was holding that position in 1875 when he died.

Other business interests

Banking
The national news media called Stillman Witt one of Cleveland's greatest bankers of the post-Civil War period.

Witt first entered the banking business in 1856. That year, he partnered with Hinman Hurlbut, James Mason, Henry Perkins, Joseph Perkins, James Mason, Amasa Stone, Morrison Waite, and Samuel Young to purchase the Toledo Branch of the State Bank of Ohio.

Witt was elected a director of Cleveland's Bank of Commerce in 1859. He held that position through 1863, when the bank reorganized as the First National Bank of Cleveland. Witt was elected to the new bank's board of directors.

Witt co-organized the Cleveland Banking Company in 1863 with George B. Ely, George A. Garretson, Amasa Stone, and Jeptha Wade, and was elected to its first board of directors. He held this position until 1868, when it merged with the Second National Bank in 1868. Witt, who had been a director of the Second National Bank since 1866, Witt was elected a director of the merged bank in 1873.

Witt was elected a vice president of the Society for Savings, one of Cleveland's biggest banks, in 1867, and a director of the Commercial National Bank in 1879 and 1873.

Standard Oil

Through his role as one of Cleveland's most respected bankers, Witt played a significant role in the founding of Standard Oil.

In the fall of 1871, Cleveland oil refiner John D. Rockefeller learned of a conspiracy being promoted by Thomas A. Scott (First Vice President of the Pennsylvania Railroad) and Peter H. Watson (then a director of the LS&MS): Using a vaguely-worded corporate charter Scott had obtained from the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the Pennsylvania Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, the Erie Railroad, Standard Oil, and a few small oil refining companies would create and invest in the South Improvement Company (SIC). The SIC's participating railroads would give the SIC's investor-refiners a 50 percent rebate on oil shipments, helping them to drive competitors out of business. Additionally, any time the SIC carried the oil of a non-participating refiner, the SIC would give a 40-cents-per-barrel payment ($ in  dollars) to the investor-refiners. The SIC would also provide the investor-refiners with information on the shipments of their competitors, giving them a critical advantage in pricing and sales.

Rockefeller saw the SIC as the ideal mechanism for achieving another goal: A monopoly on oil refining in Cleveland. Once the SIC had severely weakened his competitors, Standard Oil would buy out the city's 26 major oil refining companies at fire sale prices. The monopoly would allow Standard Oil to dominate the national refining market, garner significantly higher profits, and drive even more competitors out of business. With higher profits, Standard Oil could then rapidly expand, becoming the nation's dominant oil refining company. To make the purchases, Standard Oil needed cash. To secure the cash, Rockefeller allowed Amasa Stone, Stillman Witt, Benjamin Brewster, and Truman P. Handy—all of whom were officers in Cleveland banks—to buy shares in Standard Oil at par in December 1871. Witt and the other bankers used their influence at their own and other banks to give Rockefeller the financial backing he needed. Witt now owned the equivalent of 5 percent of the entire outstanding stock of Standard Oil.

The SIC conspiracy collapsed in March 1872, but between February 17 and March 28, 1872, Rockefeller was able to buy out 22 of the 26 major refiners in Cleveland, an event which historians call ""the Cleveland Massacre"". Witt played a part in the success of the event. Rockefeller knew that if he bought out the weak refiners first, he'd generate opposition and never get a chance to take on the larger, more profitable ones. So he tackled his strongest competitor, the firm of Clark, Payne & Co., led by Oliver Hazard Payne and backed by the wealthy J. G. Hussey family. In December 1871, Rockefeller asked Payne to meet him at the Second National Bank in Cleveland to discuss business matters in which the bank had an interest. Witt and Amasa Stone were both officers in the bank. Payne swiftly agreed to a merger of his interests with Rockefeller's, and the transaction closed in early January 1872.

Witt continued to play a role in aiding Standard Oil financially. Rockefeller approached the Second National Bank for a major loan in early 1872. Amasa Stone expected the much younger Rockefeller to be deferential and suppliant, but he was not. Stone angrily opposed the loan during a bank board of directors meeting. After Rockefeller made his case to the board, Stone suggested that Payne and Witt arbitrate the dispute. The two officers voted to support Rockefeller.

Witt once more came to Rockefeller's aid a few months later. On July 30–31, 1872, Standard Oil's terminal at Hunters Point, New York, suffered a devastating fire. With the company's insurer refusing to pay until after an investigation, Standard Oil was in desperate need for cash to rebuild. The officers of the company asked Rockefeller to seek another loan from the Second National Bank. At a meeting between Rockefeller and the bank's directors, Stone demanded that Standard Oil be appraised and its financial condition assessed before any loan was issued. Offended, Stillman Witt approved the loan, and Stone was stymied.

Steel, telegraphy, and insurance
Stillman Witt also had financial interests in the iron and steel industry. The iron and steel manufacturing firm of Chisholm, Jones and Company had organized in 1857. It was reorganized in 1860 as Stone, Chisholm & Jones after receiving major investments from Stillman Witt, Henry Chisholm, Amasa Stone, Andros Stone, Henry B. Payne, and Jeptha Wade. Witt made a second investment in the firm in November 1863, reorganizing the steel mill into the Cleveland Rolling Mill (later known as the American Steel & Wire Co.). Witt was named a director of the new company. Witt was elected a director of the Mercer Iron & Coal Company in 1865, director of the Pittsburgh and Lake Angeline Iron Company in 1870, and president of the Union Steel Screw Company (a new firm organized by himself, Henry Chisholm, William Chisholm, Henry Payne, Amasa Stone, and Andros Stone) in 1872.

Through his association with Jeptha Wade, Witt also served on the board of directors of Western Union from October 1869 to October 1872.

Witt also co-founded and was the first president of the Sun Insurance Company. Organized in Ohio, it spread to Massachusetts in 1869; Wisconsin in 1870; Kentucky, Illinois, and New York in 1872; and Michigan in 1874. He was still president at the time of his death.

Charitable activities
Stillman Witt was a lifelong Baptist. He co-founded the Protestant Home for the Friendless Stranger (an orphan asylum) in Cleveland in 1852, and served as its president in 1866. He was elected a national lay director of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society in 1869, and built Idaka Chapel in 1874 for use as a missionary church by First Baptist Church of Cleveland (of which he was a member).

Witt's charitable endeavors were widespread. He co-founded in 1854 and served on the first board of directors of the Cleveland Female Seminary, a school for girls and young women (located on Kinsman Avenue [now Woodland Avenue] between Sawtell Avenue and Wallingford Court). He served on the board of directors for the secular Cleveland Orphan Asylum in 1858 and as one of its trustees in 1867. He served as a trustee of the Ohio State Institution for the Blind from 1865 to 1870, and was one of the largest donors to the Cleveland Charity Hospital (now St. Vincent Charity Medical Center) when it was founded in July 1865. Shortly before his death in 1875, he was elected a vice president of the Cleveland ASPCA.

Witt was civic minded as well. He served as a founding member of the Cuyahoga County Military Committee, which formed in 1863 to help recruit volunteers to fight for the Union during the American Civil War. Company A of the 124th Ohio Infantry was known as the ""Stillman Witt Guards"". He also served as treasurer of a committee which raised funds for needy soldiers' families. His service found national expression when he was elected an associate member of the United States Sanitary Commission in 1861. He remained on the commission through 1864.

Witt's work for the Sanitary Commission garnered him national attention. He was so well-respected that he was appointed an honorary pallbearer for the coffin of Abraham Lincoln when Lincoln's remains were transported through Cleveland on their way to Illinois in April 1865. He became friendly with a number of President Lincoln's associates through his Sanitary Commission work as well. In 1869, Witt discovered that former Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton was impoverished after leaving the federal government. Witt quietly gave Stanton $5,000 ($ in  dollars) to lift his family out of poverty.

Witt was also one of the major original investors in Cleveland's Lake View Cemetery when that organization was first founded in 1869. He was elected to the Lake View Cemetery Association's first board of trustees in 1870.

Death

About 1871, Witt fell ill with rheumatism (probably rheumatoid arthritis gout). He traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1873 to seek relief, and appeared to recover. The disease returned in 1874, and this time he sought treatment at the mineral springs at Green Springs, Ohio.

With the illness still afflicting him, Witt decided to travel to Europe in late spring of 1875 to seek the restoration of his health. He sailed for Europe on the SS Suevia. A severe storm struck the ship after a few days at sea. The storm appeared to have significantly abated, and Witt ventured on deck with other passengers on April 28. He was thrown from his deck chair by a sudden wave, and injured his head. The wound appeared minor, but the following day he began to suffer from a migraine. His physical health rapidly declined during that day, and he was attended to by his personal physician and the ship's doctor. He appeared to rally, but died peacefully in his sleep at about 11 PM local ship's time on April 29.

Witt's death caused widespread mourning in Cleveland, where he had an immense reputation for integrity and management. His death was ""a public calamity"", the Cleveland Leader newspaper declared. Stillman Witt was interred at Albany Rural Cemetery near Albany, New York.

Witt left a fortune worth $3 million ($ in  dollars) to his wife and daughters.

Personal life
Stillman Witt married Eliza Arnold Douglass in June 1834.

The Witts had four children: Emma, Eugenia, Giles, and Mary. Only Emma and Mary survived into adulthood.

Legacy
About 1851 or 1852, Stillman Witt built a mansion for his family at what is now 1115 Euclid Avenue in Cleveland. Considered one of the most beautiful homes in Cleveland at the time, the Neoclassical style edifice featured massive Ionic columns in front. The mansion was remodeled in 1875, shortly before his death. Witt's home helped cement Euclid Avenue's reputation as a location for the wealthy to build their homes, and extended the enclave's boundaries.

In 1869, Witt purchased for $5,000 ($ in  dollars) a house and lot at 16 Walnut Street, and donated these to the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) as a boarding home for single, unwed mothers. The boarding home moved in 1908 to the corner of Prospect Avenue and E. 18th Street, and was named the Stillman Witt Boarding Home in Witt's honor.

In 1884, Witt's estate built a hotel named The Stillman at Euclid Avenue and E. 21st Street. Fire destroyed its upper floors in 1885. The hotel was torn down between 1901 and 1902.

Although little is known about it, a steam tugboat was named for Stillman Witt. It operated on the Hudson River, Erie Canal, and Great Lakes, and sank in January 1858.

"Sunset at Chaophraya (2013 film)

Sunset at Chaophraya (, Khu Kam) in 2013 romantic-war-drama film directed by Kittikorn Liasirikun. Adapted from the novel Khu Kam by Thommayanti, the story is a love triangle, set in World War II-era Thailand, and depicts the star-crossed romance between an Imperial Japanese Navy officer and a Thai woman who is involved with the Free Thai resistance. It was released on April 4, 2013. One of top five box office hits (Thailand film) in 2013.

Starring Nadech Kugimiya as Kobori, a Japanese Military Officer who is in the Japanese troop that invaded Siam, and Oranate D. Caballes as Angsumalin (Hideko), a young Siamese woman whose feelings towards Kobori are complicated by her strong, anti-Japanese sense of nationalism and her intention to romantically commit to a childhood friend upon his return from abroad.

The story depicts first love from the perspective of young characters, and how it affects their lives and their aspirations.

Kugimiya and Caballes made their film debut.

Plot
Set in 1939, the early days of World War II in Siam, the film begins with Angsumalin meeting for one last time with her childhood friend, a young Thai man named Vanus. He is leaving for England for schooling, and hopes that Angsumalin will wait for him and marry him when he returns.

Shortly thereafter, Thailand is invaded by Japanese military forces. In Thonburi, opposite Bangkok on the Chaophraya River, the Imperial Japanese Navy establishes a base. The forces there are led by Kobori, an idealistic young captain. One day he sees Angsumalin swimming in the river and falls for her. She, being a proudly nationalistic Thai woman, despises him because he is a foreigner.

Nonetheless, Kobori persists at seeing her and a courtship develops. Angsumalin finds that Kobori is a gentleman and starts falling for him, but she kept her feelings secret because of the war and because of her involvement with the resistance.

Then, for political reasons, Angsumalin's father - who is the leader of the Free Thai resistance, insists that she marry Kobori. Understanding that Angsumalin is not marrying him out of love, Kobori promises not to touch her, but he breaks that vow after the wedding.

Despite this, Angsumalin develops tender feelings for Kobori, but is still torn by her feelings for her nation and feeling guilty towards Vanus, upon whose return sets in motion a conflict between the two men.

"JavaOS

JavaOS is an operating system with a Java virtual machine as a fundamental component, originally developed by Sun Microsystems. Unlike Windows, Mac OS, Unix, or Unix-like systems which are primarily written in the C programming language, JavaOS is primarily written in Java. It is now considered a legacy system.

History 
The Java programming language was introduced by Sun in May 1995. Across the following six months, the Java platform and its ideas propagated through the world. Jim Mitchell and Peter Madany at JavaSoft designed a new operating system, codenamed Kona, written completely in Java. In March 1996, Tom   Saulpaugh joined the now seven person Kona team to design an I/O architecture, having come from Apple as Mac OS engineer since June 1985 and co-architect of Copland.

JavaOS was first evangelized in a Byte article. In 1996, JavaSoft's official product announcement described the compact OS designed to run ""in anything from net computers to pagers"". In early 1997, JavaSoft transferred JavaOS to SunSoft. In late 1997, Bob Rodriguez led the team to collaborate with IBM who then marketed the platform, accelerated development, and made significant key architectural contributions to the next release of JavaOS, eventually renamed JavaOS for Business. IBM indicated its focus was more on network computer thin clients, specifically to replace traditional ""green screen"" and UNIX terminals, and to implement single application clients. The Chorus distributed real-time operating system was purchased for its microkernel technology.

JavaSoft has granted licenses to more than 25 manufacturers, including Oracle Corp, Acer Inc., Xerox, Toshiba Corp, and Nokia. IBM and Sun announced the cooperation for JavaOS for Business at the end of March 1998.

In 1999, Sun and IBM announced the discontinuation of the JavaOS product. As early as 2003, Sun materials referred to JavaOS as a ""legacy technology"", recommending migration to Java ME, leaving the choice of specific OS and Java environment to the implementer.

Overview 
JavaOS is based on a hardware architecture native microkernel, running on platforms including ARM, PowerPC, SPARC, StrongARM, and IA-32 (x86). The Java virtual machine runs on top of the microkernel. All device drivers are written in Java and executed by the virtual machine. A graphics and windowing system implementing the AWT API is also written in Java.

JavaOS was designed to run on embedded systems and has applications in devices such as set top boxes, networking infrastructure, and ATMs. It comes with the JavaStation.

"Hybrid Theory Conferences

Hybrid Theory Conferences were a series of academic conferences held at Yale University from 1997 through 2001.

The Hybrid Theory Conferences were started in New Haven at Yale University during the late 1990s, and held during the last week in April 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. It was founded by students from within the Comparative Literature, Physics, and Philosophy Departments, who took to calling themselves Hybridists.

History
The Hybrid Theory Conferences at Yale explored the convergence, inter-penetration and consequent hybridization of traditional and emergent communication mediums. The Conference founders initiated the series as a vehicle for (1) fueling the birth of new hybridized communication mediums and technologies, (2) developing new hybrid theories to explore the mutating hybridized social, cultural and economic forms enabled by these emergent mediums, and (3) as a  localized attempt to break down the walls said to exist between town and gown: the Yale University community and the Town of New Haven's inhabitants and workers. Speakers at the different conference events included members of the Yale community (including professors, graduate students and plant operation workers), leading entrepreneurs behind local internet and software start-ups, futurists, media and marketing consultants, local businessmen, landlords, politicians, union representatives from Bridgeport Brewing, townspeople from New Haven and many others. The diversity of the speakers and the audiences at the Hybrid Theory Conference was both a sign of the Conference success reinvigorating the format of public speaking and an expression of the founders stated belief that the standard academic conference format contributed to the belief amongst non-academics that theory was either irrelevant or a ""dying body.""

Format
The format of the conferences were derived in part from the Situationist International and French Surrealism and differed each year. Presentations at the second conference in 1998 were restricted to 3, 5, 10, or 20 minute durations. By radically shortening presentations down to nothing more than a couple of gestures entwined around a sentence or two in some cases, the Hybridists attempted to remove the long wait for meaning typical of the academic setting and reconnect conferences to more succinct and effectual public spectacles such as the boxing match or directing traffic. In part they saw the trope of Parataxis infecting the contemporary media landscape, and thought it was under represented in the Academy.

Themes
The Conferences were loosely ordered around themes. The advertised themes were:
1997: ""Christ and the Shore: The Littoral Dollar""
1998: ""Circularity and Odor: Olfactory Gaming""
1999: ""Diabetics and Terroristics: the Hostage Twinky""
2000: ""Heidegger, God, and Ayn Rand""
2001: ""Marketing Alan Ginsberg""

Presentations
Presentations by Jonathan Bernstein, Kjell Otterness, Lance Duerfahrd, Marc Feldman, Frank Greco, Henry Pickford, David Procuniar, Anders Otterness, Susanna Slocum, Michelle Tupko, Wayne Tvedt, and others.

Attendance
Every presentation was preceded by a lengthy toast that in some instances exceeded the length of the paper.

"Casualty (series 12)

The twelfth series of the British medical drama television series Casualty commenced airing in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 11 September 1997 and finished on 28 February 1998. The first episode was originally due to be shown on the evening of Saturday 6 September, but this was delayed until the following Thursday due to coverage of the Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales earlier on that day, as the BBC felt it would be inappropriate to air the episode so soon after such an event. 

This series was notable as two of the episodes (episodes 1 and 17) had an extended 'feature-length' running time of 75 minutes, compared to the standard episode length of 50 minutes. Episode 17, The Golden Hour, aired on 27 December 1997, featured a multiple motorway pile-up. 

The series also featured the first official two-part story, Everlasting Love, which played out over episodes 25 and 26.

Cast

Overview
The twelfth series of Casualty features a cast of characters working in the emergency department of Holby City Hospital. The series began with 8 roles with star billing, with a number of cast changes following the departures of several characters at the end of the previous series. Peter Birch and Julia Watson starred as emergency medicine consultants Jack Hathaway and Barbara ""Baz"" Hayes. Gray O'Brien appeared as senior house officer Richard McCaig. Derek Thompson continued his role as charge nurse Charlie Fairhead while Sorcha Cusack portrayed sister Kate Wilson. Jonathan Kerrigan appeared as staff nurse Sam Colloby. Ian Bleasdale and Sue Devaney starred as paramedics Josh Griffiths and Liz Harker. Soo Drouet continued her recurring role as Monica, an anaesthetist, until episode three. 

The series' opening episode saw the introduction of six new characters: general manager Elliot Matthews (Peter Guinness); senior house officer Georgina ""George"" Woodman (Rebecca Lacey); senior staff nurse Mark Grace (Paterson Joseph); staff nurse Tina Seabrook (Claire Goose); receptionist Amy Howard (Rebecca Wheatley); and porter Derek ""Sunny"" Sunderland (Vincenzo Pellegrino). Barbara Marten also joined the cast in episode thirteen as senior staff nurse (later, sister) Eve Montgomery. Donna Alexander returned to the cast as paramedic Penny Hutchens, now a regular cast member following guest appearances in the previous series. Patrick Robinson, Brenda Fricker, Cathy Shipton and Clive Mantle reprised their roles as Martin ""Ash"" Ashford, Megan Roach, Lisa ""Duffy"" Duffin and Mike Barratt for the two-part season finale which saw Charlie and Baz marry. Six cast members departed throughout this series: Cusack, Birch and Devaney departed in episodes ten, eleven and twelve respectively; and Watson, O'Brien and Guinness left at the conclusion of the series.

"Resource breakdown structure

In project management, the resource breakdown structure  (RBS) is a hierarchical list of resources related by function and resource type that is used to facilitate planning and controlling of project work. The Resource Breakdown Structure includes, at a minimum, the personnel resources needed for successful completion of a project, and preferably contains all resources on which project funds will be spent, including personnel, tools, machinery, materials, equipment and fees and licenses. Money is not considered a resource in the RBS; only those resources that will cost money are included.

Definition

Assignable resources, such as personnel, are typically defined from a functional point of view: ""who"" is doing the work is identified based on their role within the project, rather than their department or role within the parent companies. In some cases, a geographic division may be preferred. Each descending (lower) level represents an increasingly detailed description of the resource until small enough to be used in conjunction with the work breakdown structure (WBS) to allow the work to be planned, monitored and controlled.

Example
In common practice, only non-expendable (i.e., durable goods) resources are listed in an RBS. 
Example of hierarchies of resources:
1. Engineering
   1.1 Mr. Fred Jones, Manager
         1.1.2 Ms. Jane Wagner, Architectural Lead
         1.1.3 Software Design Team and Resources
               1.1.3.1 Mr. Gary Neimi, Software Engineer 
               1.1.3.2 Ms. Jackie Toms, UI Designer
               1.1.3.3 Standard Time Timesheet (timesheet and project tracking software)
               1.1.3.4 Microsoft Project (project scheduling)
               1.1.3.5 SQL Server (database)
         1.1.4 Hardware Architecture Team and Resources
               1.1.4.1 Ms. Korina Johannes, Resource Manager
               1.1.4.2 Mr. Yan Xu, Testing Lead
               1.1.4.3 Test Stand A
                       1.1.4.3.1 SAN Group A
                       1.1.4.3.2 Server A1
               1.1.4.4 Test Stand B
                       1.1.4.4.1 SAN Group B
                       1.1.4.4.2 Server B1
Both human and physical resources, such as software and test instruments, are listed in the example above. The nomenclature is a numbered, hierarchical list of indented layers, each level adds an additional digit representing. For example, the numeric labels (1.1, 1.1.2) make each resource uniquely identifiable.

Use in Microsoft Project
The RBS (also known as the User Breakdown Structure) fields in a Project file are specifically coded by the administrator of that project, usually the Project Manager. Sometimes a PM Administrator is designated in larger project who will manage the Project tool itself. This field is called the Enterprise Resource Outline Code and it falls into one of two categories, RBS (resource field) and RBS (assignment field). These are high-level fields that require managers who know what these will be used for in terms of the organization.

"Pinstriping

Pin striping (pinstriping) is the application of a very thin line of paint or other material called a pin stripe, and is generally used for decoration. Freehand pin stripers use a specialty brush known as a pinstriping brush. Fine lines in textiles are also called pin stripes.

Automotive, bike shops, and do-it-yourself car and motorcycle mechanics use paint pin striping to create their own custom look on the automotive bodies and parts.

Motorcycles
Pinstriping can commonly be seen exhibited on custom motorcycles, such as those built by Choppers Inc., Indian Larry, and West Coast Choppers. The decorative use of pin striping on motorcycles as it is commonly seen today was pioneered by artists Kenny Howard, (aka Von Dutch) and Dean Jeffries, Dennis ""Gibb"" Gibbish, Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth. These artists are considered pioneers of the Kustom Kulture lifestyle that spawned in the early 1950s, and are widely recognized as the ""originators of modern pin striping.""

Automobiles
In automotive body work, pin stripes are a thin vinyl tape or paint. The tape versions are adhered directly to the painted surface in the pattern desired, whilst painted ones are done by skilled artists with 'sword' shaped brushes.  The paint used by the vast majority of stripers is a lettering enamel made by 1 Shot although  companies such as House of Kolor and lately Kustom Shop also make striping urethane. 

The goal of pin striping is to enhance the curves of the surface, and the lines are generally of a complementary color.  In any other form of decorative pin stripes, the goal is the same. In addition and coincidentally, it can help to hide flaws in the surface such as a scratch or blemish.

Pin stripe décor is also applied to motorcycles, bicycles, semi trucks, boats, and surfboards. It traditionally Is combined with freehand lettering and to a lesser degree sign making. The age of computers and vinyl decals helped undercut the base of traditional sign making and with it the traditional pinstriper.

Whilst stripers such as Lyle Fisk, Von Dutch (Kenny Howard) and Ed ""Big Daddy"" Roth are possibly the best known early practitioners of 'modern' pin striping, many of the early stripers cite Tommy ""The Greek"" Hrones and Dean Jeffries as their major influences. 

There are countless brush artists who carry on the tradition, not only in the US but across the globe — The Doc in Compton, Preacher (Peter McDermott) in San Antonio Texas, Steve Kafka in Arizona, Alton Gillespie in Fort Worth, Texas, Victor in Nebraska,Alan Johnson Blairstown, New Jersey, Cliff Anderson Minneapolis, Minnesota, Gator in Tennessee, One Arm Bandit in New England, Anthony White in Florida, SCORCH Pinstriping(Daniel Lee) in Bakersfield California (Kustom Drink Paint), Don Q Studios in Orange County California, MWM from Hot Rod Surf in San Diego, Brando in Chicago, Tommy ""Itchy"" Otis in Los Angeles,  California, Don ""Spiderman"" Fite of Portland, Oregon and Herb Martinez to name a few of the US stripers. Tramp Warner in Canada...Nefarious, Neil Melliard and Tootall Paul in the UK, Tom Plate in Germany, Simon Watts from Australia, Makoto in Japan and  Eduardo Bignami in Brazil show that pinstriping has become a worldwide art form.  In addition to that, Mark Court of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars still pinstripes the ""coachline"" of that company's cars by hand.

The method to ""pull lines"" used by contemporary stripers has changed little since the '50s. A beginner can start with nothing more than sword striper and a can of 1 shot enamel. Although some art shops like JC Hetz Studio in Iowa or Curlys Pinstriping in California have combined it with modern computer graphics to advance the trade. The ""Beugler"" is a mechanical version of the sword striping brush that is useful in production settings. 

Mack still makes brushes the same way they did when Andrew Mack started the company, although their product line includes more than just swords. Stripers such as Steve Kafka and Mr J have designed brushes suited to their striping styles; the Kafka brushes make the swirls and complicated designs, which make up Kafka's signature style, much easier to do, and Mr J's Xcaliber brushes have shorter hairs than the traditional Mack, making them more suited to beginners.

Mainstream is the third and final studio album released by Lloyd Cole and the Commotions. It was produced by Ian Stanley and released by Capitol Records in the US and Polydor in the UK on 26 October 1987. It contained the hits ""From the Hip"", ""My Bag"", and ""Jennifer She Said"". Although the album reached number nine in the UK, it failed to chart in America and was not embraced by all critics: Mainstream is the only Lloyd Cole and the Commotions release not to sell at least 100,000 copies in the US.

Recording
The album took two years to make as finding a producer proved difficult. The band first went with Chris Thomas, when that did not work out they brought in Stewart Copeland. With Copeland they only recorded one track, ""Hey Rusty"", then finally found Ian Stanley.

Donegan reflected in 2004 that ""with the previous LP, Easy Pieces, we had tried to broaden out and make more of a pop record and it hadn't really worked. It sounded rushed and the songs were not all up to standard. So, a year after Easy Pieces, we went into the studio to try and make something more powerful. But the LP that we actually made took so long that we lost our initial vision by the time we finished it. The songs that Lloyd was writing were more introspective, so the stadium rock idea gradually went out the window.""

Mainstream cost £300,000, ten times as much as their debut album Rattlesnakes, and took five months to record. Keyboardist Blair Cowan had already left the group by the time the album came out (hence his picture is missing from the photographs of the band that feature on the artwork, and only included on a 'dedication' to him on the inner sleeve) and Donegan was also close to calling it a day, having been accepted on a journalism course. As a result the group decided that they had come to a natural end and to split up after the release of the album, but were obliged to promote it and undertake a tour first, which took a year. After the Commotions had broken up, Cole moved to New York to resume his songwriting partnership with Cowan and joined up with Fred Maher and Robert Quine, both formerly with Lou Reed, to begin work on a solo career.

Composition
The album's opening track and lead single, ""My Bag"", contains several allusions to cocaine. Cole said, ""I wrote [the song] when I was drunk one night. It's basically about a coked up stockbroker. I took most of the scenarios from that song from Big Lights, Bright City [sic] or things that I'd heard like some executive that we've dealt with getting a phone call from another part of the office saying, 'Come upstairs, it's snowing' which of course meant a whole load of new coke was in. I thought 'a multi-story snowstorm' was quite a nice way to start a song."" On the track ""From the Hip"", which charted in the UK, Cole laments over his helplessness in combating violence and abuse. ""Jennifer She Said"" has a Mark Knopfler-like guitar break and is about a newlywed who has lost interest and ""last forever love that leads to a tattoo"". 

""Mr. Malcontent"" is based on the character played by Daniel Day-Lewis in My Beautiful Laundrette and is about someone who would rather waste time than face the world. ""Sean Penn Blues"" is a ""cheeky [and] upbeat"" tune and ""recover[s] the sly wit"" of the band's earlier material. The track was inspired by an incident that Cole had read about in which the actor Sean Penn was invited to a poetry reading which turned out to be set up purely to mock him. The song opens with dialogue featuring the voices of Scottish actors Robbie Coltrane and Katy Murphy, taken from the BBC television comedy-drama series Tutti Frutti which had been broadcast seven months before the release of Mainstream.

""Hey Rusty"", the one track produced by Stewart Copeland of The Police, has a ""Springsteen-like theme and a U2-like musical track"". ""These Days"" has a bassline copied from a track on Mister Heartbreak by Laurie Anderson and has been called ""gorgeous [and] melancholic"".

Critical reception

Although Mainstream was not universally embraced by the press it was favored by some critics. Q said, ""Two years and six producers in the making, Mainstream could have easily appeared suffering from exhaustion and over-production... Mainstream put Lloyd Cole in the enviable position of being on a hat-trick of excellent contemporary pop albums. It is to his credit that he has remained communicative without being verbose and intelligent without being clever-clever."" John Williamson of the Evening Times called Mainstream ""the band's most accomplished work to-date"" and ""a major development for the band"". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide the album is called Cole's ""most well-rounded"" and ""cleanly produced"". Jim Zebora of the Record-Journal gave the album a B and said it ""hit with a lot of artistry"" but admits Cole's ""potential hasn't been reached"". RS Murthi of New Straits Times writes that Cole's ""rough-hewn vocals...provide a fine contrast to the smooth and buoyant music"" and it ""bristles with chiming guitars and dulcet synthesizer textures"". NME observed that ""instead of going mad, these people have overcome mega self-consciousness to make a record they should have made years ago. Mainstream beats most contemporary rock for its wit, intelligence and use of stringed instruments, and it thrashes crateloads of pop on the tunes, production and fun level."" Record Mirror considered that calling the album Mainstream was ""asking for trouble. It's a statement of intent as well as a nifty way to draw critics' fire before the cries of 'sell out' come your way."" The reviewer felt that ""the only disappointment is that Mainstream sounds a little too polite at times. You yearn for just one track that will hit you between the shoulder blades with the bare boned intensity of some of their earlier work..."" but concluded that overall it was ""a flawed (slightly) masterpiece"".

On the other hand, Richard Luck of The Rough Guide to Rock writes that Mainstream ""was by and large a disappointing affair"". William Ruhlmann, in Allmusic, laments that there is ""little to alleviate the vitriol in the music"". He did favor the track ""Hey Rusty"" but other than that he believes the songs are not ""coherent, specific, [or] moving"" Lastly, the album is described in The Great Rock Discography as ""sound[ing] lacklustre in comparison"" to their earlier work. Sounds was disappointed, saying, ""Unfortunately, by developing his laid-back style, Lloyd has sacrificed some of the urgency and excitement so often present in his tales of seedy weekends and perfect lovers... He's given up pampering the intellectuals and is facing up to the things that are important in his own life. For these changes he can only be applauded, and yet the net result, at moments, seems somewhat lacklustre.""

"K.F.C. Olympic Burst

KFC Olympic Burst is a Belgian association football club based in Burst, East Flanders. The club has matricule number 3901 and the club's colours are black and blue. They currently play in East Flanders Division Three in the Belgian Provincial leagues. They play their home games at the Complex Oudendijk in Burst.

History 

The club was founded on 20 August 1943 and joined the Royal Belgian Football Association, with matricule number 3901 being assigned to the team. Burst played in the provincial leagues and did reach the Second Provincial, but was then swiftly relegated back to Third Provincial. They were the winner of their series, Third Provincial D, in season 2009/10, resulting in Burst re-appearing, after a long absence, in the Second Provincial. However, after two seasons, Burst was again relegated back to the Third Provincial in season 2011/12.

Merger plans 

There are ongoing plans for the four remaining clubs from Erpe-Mere (SK Aaigem, KRC Bambrugge, KFC Olympic Burst and FC Mere) to merge. A new stadium will be built on the domain of Steenberg, with an objective of it being ready by 2015. However, the merger is not expected to happen before 2016 at the earliest due to the need for a multi-purpose hall to be built first in Steenberg (source: municipality Erpe-Mere). The new football club will use the matricule number of KRC Bambrugge, that plays in the first provincial league, as the other teams play in lower series. It is thought to be almost certain that there will be black in the new club's colours, because of the four clubs that are still active, and the three clubs who merged into FC Mere, all had black in their club's colours. The K of Koninklijke (Royal) and Erpe-Mere will appear in the new club's name. More information about the name is currently unavailable.

"The Surgeon (video game)

The Surgeon is a computer game published in 1985 by Information Systems for Medicine (ISM) for Amiga and Macintosh. The game has two sequels, The Surgeon II and The Surgeon III. In this game, the player is a surgeon. Dr. Myo Thant, The Surgeon's designer, would later go on to design Life & Death, a surgical game with similar elements, albeit with a wider release.

Gameplay
In The Surgeon, the player takes the role of a surgeon in a hospital. The game begins with the player meeting with a patient, and being provided with either a x-ray of the spine or an ultrasound examination of the abdomen, both of which may need to be requested by the player for further insight rather than being given to begin with. When meeting with a patient, the player may judge the patient's condition from a description of symptoms from the patient and the information they're given, and the player may choose to observe the patient (do nothing), prescribe painkillers, or operate. Inaction, such as prescribing painkillers or doing nothing if a patient's condition is serious and time-sensitive, may result in the patient's death. Patients may also die from failed surgery, or abrupt complications during surgery if the player fails to treat them in time. Patients may also die post-surgery from infection if the player neglects to sterilize the area with antiseptic solution before and after surgery, or by not washing their hands.

The death of a patient resets the player's progress, and The Surgeon lacks a save function. The Surgeon's manual details possible medical afflictions the player will need to diagnose and treat in-game, describing their symptoms and the treatment needed. The manual also offers detailed step-by-step instructions for the surgeries in The Surgeon.

Reception 
Macworld reviewed the Macintosh version of The Surgeon; the reviewer is a licensed doctor of medicine. Macworld says that the beginning of the game becomes ""boring"" after playing it several times, a necessity due to the game's lack of a save function, and due to a patient's death resetting progress in-game, they express that ""you find yourself going through the early steps again and again."" Macworld praises the gameplay and graphics, stating that ""The operation consists of a well-defined series of steps that begins with scrubbing yourself and preparing the patient's skin with antiseptic solution. During surgery, any of several potentially fatal complications may arise. If you fail to recognize or treat them properly, the patient will die"", calling the gameplay a ""reasonably accurate simulation"" and ""fast paced"", but disputes a claim in the game's manual that the game may be valuable to medical students, instead suggesting that ""it might prove educational and challenging to nonmedical personnel.""

INFO reviewed the Amiga version of The Surgeon, giving it three out of five stars. The reviewer wrote that the game was ""definitely not for the squeamish"" and an ""absolutely realistic simulation where you must make quick, correct decisions to fix an aneurysm."" INFO expressed that ""Additional diseases would have given this more stars, but once you've mastered the aneurysm, there's nothing else to do.""

Datormagazin, the Swedish computer magazine, gave the Amiga version three out of five stars. Datormagazin praised The Surgeon's ""helpful"" UI and that the game offers hints as to what to do during surgery, and stated that ""Surgeon seems to be a realistic simulation of an operation, it's not just cutting in, removing the bad part, putting in a new one and sewing them up. There are many steps involved, and if you do not have any medical education or equivilant, it is doubtful if you can do it at all."" Datormagazin further notes the game's difficulty, expressing that ""In the manual, there are step-by-step instructions for the operation ... But even if you have those instructions in front of you, it's uncertain that you'll succeed ... Even if you get as far as sewing the patient back together again, he may die after the surgery, because you made a small mistake during the operation."" They also say that their interest in the game ""only went so far"", expressing that ""for a doctor or medical student, this game is probably very good, fun, and interesting. For me, who's just an ordinary person, it's not as fun."" Datormagazin calls The Surgeon ""an original and fun idea"", but states that ""it is worse than games meant for the general public"" due to its niche audience.

"Haixiu 121-class tug

Haixiu 121 class tug is a class of naval auxiliary ship currently in service with the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).  The class is named after the first unit commissioned, and only a single unit of this class is known to be in active service.

The designation Haixiu 121 is unique in that it is different from the usual Chinese naming convention for ships in military service. Ordinarily, auxiliary ships in PLAN service are designated by a combination of two or more Chinese characters followed by three-digit number. The first Chinese character denotes which fleet the ship is belongs to-- East () for East Sea Fleet, North () for North Sea Fleet, and South () for South Sea Fleet. The second indicates the function the ship performs, usually  for tugboats. Haixiu 121 is a tug, but is designated a repair ship ). The pennant numbers may have changed due to a change of Chinese naval ships naming convention.
