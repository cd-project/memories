$$\mathbb{E}(\max(U_{1},U_{2},...,U_{5})),$$ 
with each $U _{i}$ being uniformly distributed on the interval $(0,3).$ 
The c.d.f. of $\max(U_{1},U_{2},...,U_{5})$, let's call it $F_{M}(t)$, is 
$$\mathbb{P}(M< t) = \prod_{i=1}^{5}\mathbb{P}(U_{i}< t) = (\frac{t}{3})^{5}.$$
The p.d.f. is then 
$$f_{M}(t)= \frac{\mathrm{d} }{\mathrm{d} t}F_{m}(t)= \frac{5}{3}(\frac{t}{3})^{4}.$$

In particular, if $b$ is one of the four fixed points of $\iota$ on $B$, then $\iota$ induces an involution of ${\mathbb P}^2_b$ that preserves the quartic $V_b$. Since the fixed locus of an involution of the plane contains a line, it follows that $\iota$ has at least a fixed point on $V_b$.
