"It is done, and submitted. You can play “Survival of the Tastiest” on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multi-touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing.

There’s a lot I’d like to talk about. I’ll go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list.

Concept

Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks I had to face.

Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise – something with lots of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident I could fit any theme around it.

In the end, the problem with a theme like “Evolution” in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game?

In a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it’s not evolution anymore – it’s the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the very idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that’s not something that rubbed me the right way.

Hence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn’t want to create an “intelligent design” simulator and wrongly call it evolution.

This is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I’d say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I haven’t seen any entry using this at its core gameplay.

Alas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out.

My initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn’t think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that.

Borgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg?

The third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it.

Conversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the “Mechanical Underdogs” signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist – by evolving from a normal dinner table.

So the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your “base”. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate.

Your plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by “ordering” them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying costs, which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits).

Once spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps).

Your pasta doesn’t like other people’s pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill.

Once a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate, it starts conquering it for its team. It takes around 10 seconds for a plate to be conquered; less if more pasta from the same team are around. If pasta from other team are around, though, they get locked down in their attempt, unable to conquer the plate, until one of them die (think Battlefield’s standard “Conquest” mode).

You get points every second for every plate you own.

Over time, the concept also evolved to use an Italian bistro as its main scenario.

Setup

No major changes were made from my work setup. I used FDT and Starling creating an Adobe AIR (ActionScript) project, all tools or frameworks I already had some knowledge with.

One big change for me was that I livestreamed my work through a twitch.tv account. This was a new thing for me. As recommended by Roushey, I used a program called XSplit and I got to say, it is pretty amazing. It made the livestream pretty effortless and the features are awesome, even for the free version. It was great to have some of my friends watch me, and then interact with them and random people through chat. It was also good knowing that I was also recording a local version of the files, so I could make a timelapse video later.

Knowing the video was being recorded also made me a lot more self-conscious about my computer use, as if someone was watching over my shoulder. It made me realize that sometimes I spend too much time in seemingly inane tasks (I ended up wasting the longest time just to get some text alignment the way I wanted – it’ll probably drive someone crazy if they watch it) and that I do way too many typos where writing code. I pretty much spend half of the time writing a line and the other half fixing the crazy characters in it.

My own stream was probably boring to watch since I was coding for the most time. But livestreaming is one of the cool things to do as a spectator too. It was great seeing other people working – I had a few tabs opened on my second monitor all the time. It’s actually a bit sad, because if I could, I could have spent the whole weekend just watching other people working! But I had to do my own work, so I’d only do it once in a while, when resting for a bit.

Design

Although I wanted some simple, low-fi, high-contrast kind of design, I ended up going with somewhat realistic (vector) art. I think it worked very well, fitting the mood of the game, but I also went overboard.

For example: to know the state of a plate (who owns it, who’s conquering it and how much time they have left before conquering it, which pasta units are in the queue, etc), you have to look at the plate’s bill.

The problem I realized when doing some tests is that people never look at the bill! They think it’s some kind of prop, so they never actually read its details.

Plus, if you’re zoomed out too much, you can’t actually read it, so it’s hard to know what’s going on with the game until you zoom in to the area of a specific plate.

One other solution that didn’t turn out to be as perfect as I thought was how to indicate who a plate base belongs to. In the game, that’s indicated by the plate’s decoration – its color denotes the team owner. But it’s something that fits so well into the design that people never realized it, until they were told about it.

In the end, the idea of going with a full physical metaphor is one that should be done with care. Things that are very important risk becoming background noise, unless the player knows its importance.

Originally, I wanted to avoid any kind of heads-up display in my game. In the end, I ended up adding it at the bottom to indicate your credits and bases owned, as well as the hideous out-of-place-and-still-not-obvious “Call Waiter” button. But in hindsight, I should have gone with a simple HUD from the start, especially one that indicated each team’s colors and general state of the game without the need for zooming in and out.

Development

Development went fast. But not fast enough.

Even though I worked around 32+ hours for this Ludum Dare, the biggest problem I had to face in the end was overscoping. I had too much planned, and couldn’t get it all done.

Content-wise, I had several kinds of pasta planned (Wikipedia is just amazing in that regard), split into several different groups, from small Pastina to huge Pasta al forno. But because of time constraints, I ended up scratching most of them, and ended up with 5 different types of very small pasta – barely something to start when talking about the evolution of Pasta.

Pastas used in the game. Unfortunately, the macs where never used

Which is one of the saddest things about the project, really. It had the framework and the features to allow an endless number of elements in there, but I just didn’t have time to draw the rest of the assets needed (something I loved to do, by the way).

Other non-obvious features had to be dropped, too. For example, when ordering some pasta, you were supposed to select what kind of sauce you’d like with your pasta, each with different attributes. Bolognese, for example, is very strong, but inaccurate; Pesto is very accurate and has great range, but it’s weaker; and my favorite, Vodka, would triggers 10% loss of speed on the pasta hit by it.

The code for that is mostly in there. But in the end, I didn’t have time to implement the sauce selection interface; all pasta ended up using bolognese sauce.

To-do list: lots of things were not done

Actual programming also took a toll in the development time. Having been programming for a while, I like to believe I got to a point where I know how to make things right, but at the expense of forgetting how to do things wrong in a seemingly good way. What I mean is that I had to take a lot of shortcuts in my code to save time (e.g. a lot of singletons references for cross-communication rather than events or observers, all-encompassing check loops, not fast enough) that left a very sour taste in my mouth. While I know I used to do those a few years ago and survive, I almost cannot accept the state my code is in right now.

At the same time, I do know it was the right thing to do given the timeframe.

One small thing that had some impact was using a somewhat new platform for me. That’s Starling, the accelerated graphics framework I used in Flash. I had tested it before and I knew how to use it well – the API is very similar to Flash itself. However, there were some small details that had some impact during development, making me feel somewhat uneasy the whole time I was writing the game. It was, again, the right thing to do, but I should have used Starling more deeply before (which is the conundrum: I used it for Ludum Dare just so I could learn more about it).

Argument and user experience

One final aspect of the game that I learned is that making the game obvious for your players goes a long way into making it fun. If you have to spend the longest time explaining things, your game is doing something wrong.

And that’s exactly the problem Survival of the Tastiest ultimately faced. It’s very hard for people to understand what’s going on with the game, why, and how. I did have some introductory text at the beginning, but that was a last-minute thing. More importantly, I should have had a better interface or simplified the whole concept so it would be easier for people to understand.

That doesn’t mean the game itself should be simple. It just means that the experience and interface should be approachable and understandable.

Conclusion

I’m extremely happy with what I’ve done and, especially given that this was my first Ludum Dare. However, I feel like I’ve learned a lot of what not to do.

The biggest problem is overscoping. Like Eric Decker said, the biggest lesson we can learn with this is probably with scoping – deciding what to do beforehand in a way you can complete it without having to rush and do something half-assed.

I’m sure I will do more Ludum Dares in the future. But if there are any lessons I can take of it, they are to make it simple, to use frameworks and platforms you already have some absolute experience with (otherwise you’ll spend too much time trying to solve easy questions), and to scope for a game that you can complete in one day only (that way, you can actually take two days and make it cool).

"Working Women, Special Provision and the Debate on Equality

There has been considerable coverage in the media recently about the possibility of offering women in employment paid leave from work during their menstrual period. This has generated a broad range of responses relating to long-standing discussions about ‘equality’ and ‘difference’: is women’s equality best achieved by treating them the same as men or by making provisions that recognise their differences in terms of physiological constitution and biological functions?

If the UK introduces such an initiative, it would not be the first country in the contemporary world to do so. Many countries in Asia already make the provision and Russia debated introducing a law in 2013. The policy also has a significant historical precedent. A whole chapter of my book Women Workers in the Soviet Interwar Economy: From ‘Protection’ to ‘Equality’ (Macmillan, 1999), based on extensive research conducted for my PhD, is devoted to ‘Provision for “Menstrual Leave”’.

In the 1920s, scientific researchers and labour hygiene specialists in the Soviet Union conducted extensive investigations into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work in manual and industrial jobs requiring a significant degree of physical labour. Their recommendations led to two decrees being issued that targeted specific categories of women workers:

Decree ‘On the release from work during menstruation of machinists and iron press workers working on cutting machines without mechanised gears in the garment industry’, 11 January 1922

Decree ‘On the working conditions of women tractor and lorry drivers’, 9 May 1931

These decrees arose from research that suggested, amongst other things, that inadequate seating at machines and on tractors resulted in congestion and tension in the abdomen that was exacerbated during menstruation. In practice, the decrees did not provide for regular absence from work. Women seeking to benefit from the provision had to provide a doctor’s note, similar to the usual requirements for sick leave.

The official research into the impact of menstruation on women’s capacity to work and the application of the decrees in practice raised a number of issues on both sides of the argument. I offer only a summary of the contemporary research findings and observer commentary here:

For the provision:
• employers have a responsibility to protect the health of their workers and unhealthy, poor and inadequate working environments can have a detrimental impact on women’s reproductive health
• women’s labour productivity and output would rise as a result
• it is essential to protect the professionalism of certain categories of workers: the debates here centred on performance artists and female theatrical employees engaged in highly physical and intensely emotional work
• heavy physical labour and strenuous exercise can lead to disruptions of the menstrual cycle
• women’s physical and intellectual capacities are reduced during menstruation; women lose muscular strength and powers of concentration
• women’s biological constitution and reproductive functions require specific recognition in law

Against the provision:
• employers are less likely to appoint women if they are guaranteed paid time off work during menstruation
• (often from male workers, who viewed the employment of women as competition) women should not be employed in jobs for which they lack the physical strength and mental capacity
• if necessary, women could be transferred to different tasks involving easier work during menstruation
• the provision would be open to uneven application and abuse
• women cannot expect to be considered equal with men if they are given special treatment in the law

It is worth noting also that the various research projects often revealed that the vast majority of women reported no regular problems or abnormalities with menstruation, and that men commonly reported higher levels of sickness than their female colleagues. Many of the problems experienced by women in the workplace could be mitigated by the introduction of improvements to their physical working conditions (not sitting down or standing up in the same position for long periods of time) or by the simple introduction of very short breaks that would allow women to walk around and get some exercise.

Debates in the UK, on the TV and in the press, are unlikely to reach a consensus on this issue. What do you think?",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

You’ve probably become more patient since you started this whole parenthood thing. And you’re going to have to practice patience even more as your toddler learns to become more independent.

For example, she tells you she can’t finish the puzzle she’s doing. Instead of jumping right in and telling her which piece goes where, you’re going to have to tell her you’ll help a little. Go ahead and help, but let her do a lot of it herself, and make sure she’s the one to finish the job. That will give her a sense of accomplishment and the confidence to try again next time.

"jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

I am the developer of jOOQ, a Java database abstraction framework. I was wondering whether jOOQ might be an interesting tool for discussion on your website, even if it is not exactly an ORM in the classic meaning (as in mapping objects to the relational world > ORM). Instead, jOOQ uses a reverse engineering paradigm (as in mapping relational entities to objects > ""ROM"").

Re: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

Object Role Modeling (the original ORM) is not the same thing as Object/Relational Mapping.

Object/Relational Mapping is still kind-of relevant and interesting to us, since Object Role Modeling is used to design databases (which then will require programmatic access). But there are probably better places to discuss it :]

Your query DSL looks rather like some of the DSLs available for Ruby, such as through the Sequel gem, or Arel. Interesting to see how well that can work with a statically-types language like Java. Maybe you or I should make a generator for ActiveFacts which generates your DSL from CQL queries?

Re: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

Sorry for my late reply. Apparently I had not really understood the ideas behind your foundation when I wrote my original post. I understand now, that you are concerned with broader concepts than the ""common ORM"". I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping, correct me if I'm wrong).

Yes, I have seen some examples for Ruby's Sequel. I personally find statically-typed languages much better for DSL's as the syntax can be formally defined and checked by a compiler - with the limitations an OO language imposes, of course.

So if I understand this correctly now, ""Object Role Modeling"" and CQL are actually a more general way of expressing what SQL calls DDL. Since you can already transform CQL into SQL DDL statements (CREATE TABLE...), and jOOQ can reverse-engineer database schemata into jOOQ generated source code, I don't think there would be need for an additional generator.

Does CQL also specify means of querying the data described by the Object Role Model? The examples I found here only seem to describe what SQL calls ""constraints"" (although with a much broader functionality-range than SQL):

Re: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

""common ORM"". I actually came across your group because of your linking to ORM Lite (where ORM does stand for Object/Relational Mapping

Object Role Modeling was named before Object Relational Mapping, but the latter is now the more common meaning, as you point out. But ORM Lite is actually so-named by Bryan because it is an implementation of Object Role Modeling, not because it is also an O/RM. Bryan was a student of Terry's at Neumont, where he learnt ORM.

Regarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.

lukas.eder:

I don't think there would be need for an additional generator

The problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models. These are almost always very different from the conceptual model, as many relationships have been condensed (absorbed) into attribute/column relationships, so the semantics of the original relationship are lost. In the process, nullable columns are usually introduced, which adds further to the confusion, as such things cannot easily be correctly constrained (uniqueness, etc) in SQL. So by reverse engineering from the relational form, you're losing most of the benefit of building a conceptual model from the start

This may be hard to see for someone used to O-O modeling, and who's authored an O/RM tool. The problem is that O-O suffers from many of the same problems of loss of semantics. The apparently clear notion of ""attribute"" breaks down when you look at it closely. O-O, although ostensibly behaviour-oriented, introduces attributes to store state, and this attribute orientation is the source of the problem in both cases. Fact-oriented model does not use attributes. Although it may seem obvious that, for example, my surname is an attribute of myself, if the system being modeled accrues the requirement to model families, suddenly surname becomes an attribute of family, and family becomes my attribute. This kind of instability is responsible for much of the rework that's required in evolving legacy systems, as well as many of the mistakes made when they were first modeled. If you want a further example of this loss of semantics, look at my Insurance example, and ask yourself why the VehicleIncident table has a DrivingBloodTestResult column. In fact, if VehicleIncident wasn't explicitly mapped separately, its fields would be in the Claim table.

What's needed is not just yet another O/RM tool (which are tuppence a dozen anyhow - I personally have written three) but a tool which supports database programming using only the conceptual model, never exposing the physical model. Surprisingly, I can't think of a single tool which has done a good job of this, but it's where I'm heading with the ActiveFacts API. It's another O/RM, but using a purely conceptual object model that preserves the domain semantics, not a typical O-O one.

lukas.eder:

Does CQL also specify means of querying the data described by the Object Role Model

Yes, though the published implementation doesn't quite handle the full query syntax (aggregate functions are still missing), nor does it yet translate them to SQL. Some examples are given towards the end of the video presentation on the CQL Introduction page.

Re: jOOQ on The ORM Foundation?

Regarding DSLs, I think internal DSLs only work well in very simple cases. I prefer external DSLs for anything complex, and that's where CQL came from. Even the extremely flexible syntax of Ruby wasn't up to the task.

Absolutely. The optimal way to implement SQL in Java would be by extending the Java language itself, such that SQL would be compiled natively by the java compiler, similar to Linq2SQL in C#, or PL/SQL in Oracle databases. So for the complexity of CQL, CQL is certainly the right solution.

Clifford Heath:

The problem is that a huge amount of meaning is lost in the mapping to SQL. SQL is practically (though not theoretically) limited to representing physical models.

You are right. I guess though, that in everyday work, this limitation is not really a problem. Personally, I think if your business rules become so complex that you cannot map them to a relational model easily anymore, then maybe your business rules could be simplified before changing/extending technologies. But that depends on the business, of course. I guess with insurance companies' businesses, I'd be pretty lost, personally ;-)

In any case, I don't see jOOQ as a means to solve modelling issues, or the O/R impedance mismatch (which is even bigger when it comes to mapping your understanding of ORM, with CQL). jOOQ should simply make using the full power of SQL in Java as simple as possible. In that way, jOOQ is not really an ORM because it does not map from objects to the relational world, or try to solve any other high-level abstraction issues. It's really a low-level tool to make a developer's life a lot easier, seeing that unfortunately, JPA CriteriaQuery didn't meet the community's expectations.

I think you're on the right track with this. I hope for you, that this will soon show nice results with a practical implementation. I'm curious to see how you'll tackle performance issues, too, with all the abstraction.

"I've learned the nitrogen vacancies used in Memristors are for ""switching"", between excited states and inhibited states, akin to our neurons and SYNAPSES abilities to generate EPSPs and IPSPs, this is the entire point to Memristors and DARPAs SyNAPSE program, emulating Neurons..

So in the memristor, NVs (which are truly Ancillas),
Return to ""resting states"", just like Neurons do, hence Inhibitory states versus excited states, when a neuron reaches an action potential and fires..

So the ancillas use prepared/ known states, and are the equivalent of the ancillas ground state, which is equal to a neurons resting potential...

So by weakly measuring certain aspects of living neurons, it is possible to superbroadcast/ teleport the wavefunction non-classically to the memristors vacancies, correlating each memristor with its neuron statistical ensemble counterpart, sharing the quantum state of the resting potential.
the ground state of the ancilla.

The type of measurement determines which property is shown. However the single and double-slit experiment and other experiments show that some effects of wave and particle can be measured in one measurement.

Hence Mach-Zehnder interferometry, which also involves ANCILLAS

Quote:

When for example measuring a photon using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second beam-splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam-splitter is omitted. The decision of whether or not to insert this beam-splitter can be made after the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler’s famous delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this experiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam splitter is itself still a classical object.

and the no-cloning theorem is about pure states..
But an ensemble of particles in a neuron would make it a mixed state..

The no-cloning theorem is normally stated and proven for pure states; the no-broadcast theorem generalizes this result to mixed states.

And thats why PHASE works for quantum metrology and its ability to harness non classical states

Apparently, worrying about measuring both position and momentum works differently for particles than it does waves.

It may actually be possible using phase.

Quote:

Niels Bohr apparently conceived of the principle of complementarity during a skiing vacation in Norway in February and March 1927, during which he received a letter from Werner Heisenberg regarding the latter's newly discovered (and not yet published) uncertainty principle. Upon returning from his vacation, by which time Heisenberg had already submitted his paper on the uncertainty principle for publication, he convinced Heisenberg that the uncertainty principle was a manifestation of the deeper concept of complementarity.[6] Heisenberg duly appended a note to this effect to his paper on the uncertainty principle, before its publication, stating:

Quote:

Bohr has brought to my attention [that] the uncertainty in our observation does not arise exclusively from the occurrence of discontinuities, but is tied directly to the demand that we ascribe equal validity to the quite different experiments which show up in the [particulate] theory on one hand, and in the wave theory on the other hand.

And ""quadratures"" is about position and momentum..
Which are apparently always orthogonal to each other.

There is obviously something to all of this.
Counterfactual Communication was recently used to transmit information without sending any PARTICLES.
the information was sent in the phase.. of a wavefunction?

and it used MachZenhder Interferometry..
which is part of Quantum Metrology and its ability to harness non-classical states..

and all of this can teleport non-classical light..

and it all uses ANCILLAS... which store VALUES, and WAVEFUNCTIONS.. because they are Qubits/ Nitrogen vacancies..

and are used in WEAK MEASUREMENT... which was used to measure a wavefunction.. something most would argue is impossible.. because of the uncertainty principle..

Quote:

An interpretation of quantum mechanics can be said to involve the use of counterfactual definiteness if it includes in the statistical population of measurement results, any measurements that are counterfactual because they are excluded by the quantum mechanical impossibility of simultaneous measurement of conjugate pairs of properties.

For example, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that one cannot simultaneously know, with arbitrarily high precision, both the position and momentum of a particle

Quote:

The word ""counterfactual"" does not mean ""characterized by being opposed to fact."" Instead, it characterizes values that could have been measured but, for one reason or another, were not

and its the Ancillas that store values.. and may or may not be part of the measurement apparatus... / interferometer..

In 2015, Counterfactual Quantum Computation was demonstrated in the experimental context of ""spins of a negatively charged Nitrogen-vacancy color center in a diamond"".[5] Previously suspected limits of efficiency were exceeded, achieving counterfactual computational efficiency of 85% with the higher efficiency foreseen in principle

Quote:

The quantum computer may be physically implemented in arbitrary ways but the common apparatus considered to date features a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. The quantum computer is set in a superposition of ""not running"" and ""running"" states by means such as the Quantum Zeno Effect. Those state histories are quantum interfered. After many repetitions of very rapid projective measurements, the ""not running"" state evolves to a final value imprinted into the properties of the quantum computer. Measuring that value allows for learning the result of some types of computations such as Grover's algorithm even though the result was derived from the non-running state of the quantum computer.

Wavefunctions can be weakly measured by ANCILLAS

ANCILLAS hold ""values"" ie : wavefunctions

and have GROUND STATES

which measured particles are ""cooled"" into for measurement techniques. a literal form of ""photon counting""..

""This de-excitation is called ‘fluorescence’, and it is characterized by a
lifetime of a few nanoseconds of the lowest vibrational level of the first excited state.
De-excitation from the excited singlet state to the ground state also occurs by other mechanisms, such as non-radiant thermal decay or ‘phosphorescence’. In the latter case, the chromophore undergoes a forbidden transition from the excited singlet state into the triplet state (intersystem crossing, ISC, Fig 2.4), which has a non-zero probability, for example because of spin orbit coupling of the electrons’ magnetic moments""

its a type of INTERSYSTEM CROSSING

doing a search for Intersystem crossing, memristor brings up this link..

A composite optical microcavity, in which nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond nanopillar are coupled to whispering gallery modes in a silica microsphere, is demonstrated. Nanopillars with a diameter as small as 200 nm are fabricated from a bulk diamond crystal by reactive ion etching and are positioned with nanometer precision near the equator of a silica microsphere. The composite nanopillar-microsphere system overcomes the poor controllability of a nanocrystal-based microcavity system and takes full advantage of the exceptional spin properties of NV centers and the ultrahigh quality factor of silica microspheres.

We investigate the construction of two universal three-qubit quantum gates in a hybrid system. The designed system consists of a flying photon and a stationary negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center fixed on the periphery of a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonator, with the WGM cavity coupled to tapered fibers functioning as an add-drop structure. These gate operations are accomplished by encoding the information both on the spin degree of freedom of the electron confined in the NV center and on the polarization and spatial-mode states of the flying photon, respectively

Now Somewhere in this is evidence of a memristor holding a wavefunction

The shown SPICE implementation (macro model) for a
charge controlled memristor model exactly reproduces the
results from [2]. However, these simulation results do not
have a good compliance - not even qualitatively - with the
characteristic form of I/V curves of manufactured devices.
Therefore the following equations (3) to (9) try to approach
memristor modeling from a different point of view to get a
closer match to the measured curves from [2],[6],[7],[8],[10]
or [11] even with a simple linear drift of w.
Besides the charge steering mechanism of a memristor modelled in [2],
[1] also defined a functional relationship for a memristor
which explains the memristive behavior in dependence on its
magnetic flux: i(t) = W φ(t) · v(t) . (3)

Variable W (φ) represents the memductance which is the
reciprocal of memristance M. Here a mechanism is demanded
that maps the magnetic flux as the input signal to the current
that is flowing through the memristor. The magnetic flux φ
is the integral of voltage v(t) over time: φ = R v(t) dt.
We can assume that an external voltage which is applied to
the previously described two-layer structure has an influence
on the movable 2+-dopants over time. The width w(t) of
the semiconductor layer is depending on the velocity of the
dopants vD(t) via the time integral:
w(t) = w0 + Z0t vD(τ)dτ . (4)

The drift velocity vD in an electric field E is defined via its
mobility µD: vD(t) = µD · E(t) (5) and the electric field E is connected with the voltage via E(t) = v(t)
D(6)with D denoting the total thickness of the two-layer structure
(D = tOX + tSEMI). Due the good conductance of the
semiconductor layer the electric field is applied to the time
depending thickness of the insulator layer tOX for the most
part (due to v(l) = R E dl). However, this was neglected for
reasons of simplification. If we combine (4), (5) and (6), we
obtain: n(t) = w0 + µDD· Z0t v(τ)dτ = w0 + µDD · φ(t) . (7)

This equation shows a proportional dependence of the width w
from the magnetic flux φ. Since the thickness of the insulator
layer is in the low nanometer region a tunnel current or
equivalent mechanism is possible. The magnetic flux slightly
decreases the thickness of the insulator layer wich is the barrierfor the tunnel current.This current rises exponentially with a
reduction of the width tOX(φ) (the exponential dependenceis deducible from the quantum mechanic wave function)

which must become the GROUND STATE of the ANCILLA upon non-classical correlation..

because a wavefunction is essentially the ""master equation"" (which describe wave equations)

We investigate theoretically how the spectroscopy of an ancillary qubit can probe cavity (circuit) QED ground states containing photons. We consider three classes of systems (Dicke, Tavis-Cummings and Hopfield-like models), where non-trivial vacua are the result of ultrastrong coupling between N two-level systems and a single-mode bosonic field. An ancillary qubit detuned with respect to the boson frequency is shown to reveal distinct spectral signatures depending on the type of vacua. In particular, the Lamb shift of the ancilla is sensitive to both ground state photon population and correlations. Back-action of the ancilla on the cavity ground state is investigated, taking into account the dissipation via a consistent master equation for the ultrastrong coupling regime. The conditions for high-fidelity measurements are determined.

\\

Notice BACK-ACTION, which goes right back to DARPAs Nanodiamond Biosensors and their ability to overcome the standard quantum limit, because of the known/ prepared states in the ancillas/NITROGEN VACANCIES

Quote:

(Quantum) back action refers (in the regime of Quantum systems) to the effect of a detector on the measurement itself, as if the detector is not just making the measurement but also affecting the measured or observed system under a perturbing effect.
Back action has important consequences on the measurement process and is a significant factor in measurements near the quantum limit, such as measurements approaching the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL).
Back action is an actively sought-after area of interest in present times. There have been experiments in recent times, with nanomechanical systems, where back action was evaded in making measurements, such as in the following paper :

When performing continuous measurements of position with sensitivity approaching quantum mechanical limits, one must confront the fundamental effects of detector back-action.Back-action forces are responsible for the ultimate limit on continuous position detection, can also be harnessed to cool the observed structure[1,2,3,4], and are expected to generate quantum entanglement.
Back-action can also be evaded, allowing measurements with sensitivities that exceed the standard quantum limit, and potentially allowing for the generation of quantum
squeezed states.

So the NV centers are used as ancillas in the measurement process.. which weakly measure wavefunctions of particles in neurons, most likely singlet and triplet states occurring in ATP and phosphase...

then those same wavefunctions are transfered and produce a correlation at the ground state..

where the ancilla takes on the new value/wavefunction.. and here we find all these ideas..
minus the switching which I can explain
Memristors use NV centers to switch between inhibited and excited states
singlet and triplet states
thus producing/simulating/ EMULATING, living neurons and action potentials

and it may just BE the network and its computing speed, that even allows the wavefunction to be ""found""

which makes such possible Quantum-assisted Nano-imaging of Living Organism Is a First

Quote:

“In QuASAR we are building sensors that capitalize on the extreme precision and control of atomic physics. We hope these novel measurement tools can provide new capabilities to the broader scientific and operational communities,” said Jamil Abo-Shaeer, DARPA program manager. “The work these teams are doing to apply quantum-assisted measurement to biological imaging could benefit DoD’s efforts to develop specialized drugs and therapies, and potentially support DARPA’s work to better understand how the human brain functions.”

""Nuclear spin imaging at the atomic level is essential for the under-standing of fundamental biological phenomena and for applicationssuch as drug discovery. The advent of novel nano-scale sensors hasgiven hope of achieving the long-standing goal of single-protein, highspatial-resolution structure determination in their natural environ-ment and ambient conditions. In particular, quantum sensors basedon the spin-dependent photoluminescence of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV)centers in diamond have recently been used to detect nanoscale en-sembles of external nuclear spins. While NV sensitivity is approachingsingle-spin levels, extracting relevant information from a very com-plex structure is a further challenge, since it requires not only theability to sense the magnetic field of an isolated nuclear spin, butalso to achieve atomic-scale spatial resolution. Here we propose amethod that, by exploiting the coupling of the NV center to an intrin-sic quantum memory associated with the Nitrogen nuclear spin, canreach a tenfold improvement in spatial resolution, down to atomic
scales.""

So what its all doing essentially, is mapping the phase of atoms/SINGLETS in ATP, onto a NV center based CCD

and at the singlet level, correlations occur.. creating entanglement

so the particles in the neuron are being correlated with the ancillas, the nitrogen vacancies, where they take on the ""target"" state..

not only is the above imaging done to obtain a correlation to living neurons, via the singlet states within, but once the connection is established, the MEMRISTOR NETWORK itself can be used to RECONSTRUCT VISION IN REAL TIME

Now add the above method, a direct connection using correlated states shared from neurons TO Memristors... and imagine the reconstruction aided by the AI within the memristor network, as it works on so.. (note, this example is done MERELY using fMRI information)
now Imagine statistical ensembles being observed in real time via non-classical entanglement

But what I'm trying to show, is hows its this assumed entanglement based BCI technology, plus the memristor network it is coupled to, that is responsible for the TI communities complaints that ""they (the government) can see through my own eyes""

The nitrogen vacancies in the scanners hold values, wavefunctions, which are prepared states aka Ancilla bits, and are the time domain/reference frequency, which carrries the ""quantum event/wavefunction"" which causes the singlet pairs to form up in the scanned biology..
and correlates with them at the ground state as the relaxation occurs..

Quote:

It is important to realize that particles in singlet states need not be locally bound to each other. For example, when the spin states of two electrons are correlated by their emission from a single quantum event that conserves angular momentum, the resulting electrons remain in a shared singlet state even as their separation in space increases indefinitely over time, provided only that their angular momentum states remain unperturbed

and that weakly measured value, the wavefunction is sent through the optical cavity, teleported to identical nitrogen vacancies in memristors.. so the ground states in both system are correlated and thus the neural activity can be monitored in real time in the memristors",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"During my pregnancy, I tried to gather as much information on how painful labor might actually be. I would often hear “mine was horrible, but everyone’s pregnancy is different” or “it was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life!”

I heard many horror stories which often ended with, “well, don’t worry. You’ll forget about the pain as soon as your child is born.” Not the most reassuring for a first-time mother, but something I definitely kept in mind the entire time.

I had feared the unknown, but on the other hand, I knew there was no turning back and that my baby was coming one way or another!

Two weeks before my due date, I noticed some blood. My water didn’t break and I saw no mucous plug, but it seemed that something was happening earlier than expected. Soon after, at 1 a.m. I woke up from a notably different type of cramping. It began to occur every 5 minutes. It wasn’t that painful (yet), but uncomfortable. I felt as if I had to go diarrhea every five minutes. If this is labor, I could handle it for sure I thought, but I knew this was only the beginning.

My husband nervously drove us to the hospital as if the baby would pop out any second. I had to remind him to not worry. Things usually didn’t happen that fast for first-time moms (or at least I hoped it wouldn’t). I had to go by instinct although in the back of my mind, I wasn’t sure what would happen next.

We finally got to the birthing center after an hour of driving and the nurses confirmed I wasn’t even dilated. I couldn’t believe it. We were turned away and had to find a hotel because returning home wasn’t an option. It would take two hours just to return again!

The diarrhea-like cramps were painful and uncomfortable; I couldn’t sleep. I was bleeding slightly and started to actually have these cramps and stomach aches over a 10 hour period. I started googling my symptoms (never a good thing!) and discovered there are people who have this uncomfortable feeling for days and weeks! “Fake labor” would not be in my cards, I had hoped.

Fortunately, I had an appointment with a midwife in the afternoon and was checked again for any cervical changes. I had finally dilated 3 cm and was 90% effaced. What a relief I thought! I welcomed the pain because I wanted things to progress. I couldn’t imagine having diarrhea cramps for weeks. However, 3 cm isn’t enough to be admitted, we were told, so back to the hotel we went.

“When your cramps become more regular, every 3 minutes a part, and you become more snippy, check in again” the midwife suggested. In the mean time, I tried to walk around, pausing multiple times to catch my breath.

A couple hours later, I was FINALLY admitted. My husband kept asking me questions non-stop about what I wanted, needed, and more. All I could say was “if I need something, I’ll let you know. Thanks.” I literally couldn’t talk. I felt like vomiting and had heart burn for the first time in my life.

As my labor progressed, I felt the urge to push before I was even 10 cm dilated. I would have a cramp, then a couple of minutes later, one that made me yell out in pain as it forced my body to push. A gush of blood would come out as this happened and I felt extremely uncomfortable because the pain was in my back and butt! It would take my breath away. However, the pain was still tolerable, believe it or not.

I had a volunteer doula come in that night who helped me breathe, rubbed my back, and encouraged me. She helped me be aware of my voice and how I could use it to save energy and get through the pain. Unfortunately, she couldn’t stay the whole night, but the time she spent with me truly made a difference. Even though labor was hard work and painful, the right breathing technique and support helped ease the pain. This is probably the number one thing that helped me get through labor!

As I started heading towards my second night of labor, I wondered how much longer I could go on … I questioned if it was even worth it to continue without an epidural? I went into labor without a plan. I wanted to go with the flow and make decisions as they came. I didn’t want to be tied to a bed or deliver on my back or disappointed if my perfect labor didn’t come true, so I left any expectations open. But after my second sleepless night, I started to inquire about pain medications (although deep down inside I knew I could handle more because the pain was still manageable). I was exhausted and sleep would have been nice especially if I didn’t have to feel any pain with an epidural.

There were no walking epidurals available though and I didn’t want to take narcotics (which could make me dizzy), so I continued along, breathing away. A bath was an option too and this I requested and wanted. I was so uncomfortable as things progressed. I couldn’t get in the shower to relax my muscles, but somehow a bath sounded soothing and worth the effort. As soon as the bath was ready, however, I suddenly felt a pop down below as if major pressure had been released from my insides. Immediately, there was a shift. The back and butt pressure/pain I felt was no longer there. It was time to push! I knew as soon as I felt it.

As the baby descended, I felt the burning sensation of the babies head crowning – a temporary stretching sting. The cramps were still there and I had no control over my own pushing. I let my body do its own work and took the breaks my body provided in between each wave of labor. I was standing up giving birth because I couldn’t get onto the bed as I would have liked and was given a stool to put my right foot onto in order to widen my pelvis. Gravity certainly assisted me. However, I never expected to be standing for 50 minutes! My legs were becoming tired and shaky, but I couldn’t move. My energy was sapped and I regretted not exercising more. Standing up was the most comfortable thing to do though and I listened to my body’s cues.

I started to go along with my body’s signals to push, but after a while I felt as if the baby would never come out because things weren’t progressing fast enough. After his head came out, I thought it was all over until I heard my husband say “push, his body is stuck!” I ended up pushing as hard as I could and a gush of fluids came spewing onto the floor. It was the best sense of relief.

The midwives held my baby from under me and told me to grab him. He was screaming, kicking, and punching his way into this life. He was so slippery, I was terrified to grab him. I had never held a baby before. He would be my first. I held my son and put him on my chest. I couldn’t stop looking at him in awe. He was so beautiful to me and I felt overwhelmed with love and joy.

When the umbilical cord finally stopped pulsating, which happened surprisingly quick, my husband carefully snipped it. At this point, I’m glad my husband didn’t pass out. I always joked that he would get queasy and faint, but my husband did amazing!

While holding my son, I had to deliver my placenta which did not hurt at all. In fact, I couldn’t even feel much down below because of the adrenaline pumping throughout my veins.

Looking into my son’s eyes and holding him for the first time was the most incredible thing in the world. The pain that I felt earlier in labor vanished and I felt ecstatic to have made it through. It’s true what they say … After your baby is born, you forget the pain of labor and birth.

At least most of it.

"POV: Henry vs Martin + a poll

I won’t make claims as to their gifts and charms, but H & M do resemble me in various ways :)

I usually like to write stories from a single point of view. It’s obviously a limited perspective, but I enjoy the constraints. As far as I’m concerned, there’s no such thing as a reliable narrator. Characters misinterpret things, miss things, draw the wrong conclusions, and it can be tricky and fun to work the “truth” into a story alongside the character’s perceptions. For instance, I think it’s obvious to the reader that Martin is DTF from the get-go, but Henry, equipped with the same amount of information, simply doesn’t get it.

When I started writing the Ganymede Quartet books, it seemed obvious to me that the story needed to be told from the master’s point of view. Whether or not he’s actually prepared to take responsibility, the fact remains that Henry’s the one in charge and he sets the tone. It’s Martin’s job to adapt and respond and accommodate and serve. Obviously, Martin is better-equipped to steer this particular ship, but, unfortunately for Henry, the roles in this relationship weren’t assigned based on fitness or merit. If you’ve read A Most Personal Property (GQ Book 1), you know that when the opportunity finally arises for Martin to take charge, he does so with great effect, but he does wait for Henry to create the opportunity. He’s very well-trained.

I think it’s apparent that Martin is miserable for most of AMPP, and writing weeks of self-doubt and misery even greater than Henry’s, from the perspective of a character who has even less power to effect change…I don’t think anyone wants to read that book, actually.

Henry also needed to be the POV character for the main books because Henry is the one who has the most growing to do. They’re both young, both immature, but Martin is less immature, his sense of self is more solid and, well, he’s a lot smarter. Henry learns a lot over the course of the series, which is not to say that Martin doesn’t, but as the one nominally in charge, Henry’s growth has a greater impact on both of them.

It was possibly something of a risk, but I left out or delayed certain trains of thought because Henry isn’t necessarily considering all aspects and implications of the master/slave dynamic from early on in their relationship. He’s very loving, but he’s not the most insightful person, and it takes him awhile to consider things that a savvier fellow might have questioned from the beginning. It really does take Henry a long time to wonder how Martin’s position and training impact the way Martin responds to him.

I anticipate going a little deeper into Martin’s background, in a way, for the story that will accompany Book 3. I also have a pretty good idea which aspect of Book 4 I’ll present from Martin’s perspective. So far, the Martin stories have been really fun to write, and I definitely look forward to doing them. I think they’re so easy and enjoyable to work on because they revisit territory that I’ve already covered from Henry’s perspective to some extent, and when I’m writing Henry, I’m always considering how Martin might view a given situation, as well.

Offering Martin’s POV at all was actually a pretty late development. It occurred to me shortly before publishing A Most Personal Property that the stories I was busy telling myself about Martin’s past would probably be of interest to anyone who was interested in AMPP, and so I quickly wrote A Superior Slave. I hoped that people who enjoyed reading ASS (ugh, that acronym!) for free might be interested in paying for AMPP, and I think that did happen to some small extent. I’ve gotten the impression (whether it’s true or not) that Martin might be the reader favorite by a small margin, so it just seems like a nice idea to continue offering Martin POV stories alongside the main books. While I think a person can enjoy the main books and Henry’s POV without side stories, I like to think Martin’s perspective is a valuable addition.

I plan on adding additional points of view from other characters in the universe. I’ve got stories written about a couple of Henry’s friends to show how slave ownership works in private for other people. I’ve got at least two stories I want to write about Henry’s cousin Jesse. I think Tom gets his own novella :D

With A Proper Lover (GQ Book 2) and A Master’s Fidelity (GQ Book 2.5) released, I’m just going immediately into editing Book 3 and fleshing out the notes I have for the Martin story. I’d had vague ideas about taking a break, but I honestly don’t know what that would mean at this point. I don’t know what I’d be doing during a break! Right now, the idea of downtime just makes me cranky. Knowing that there are people eager for the next books makes me want to work on getting them out. Besides, working on Martin’s POV is a treat :)",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The terrifying 38-minute ordeal suffered by Hawaii residents on Saturday, when the state’s emergency-management agency sent out a false alert warning of an imminent ballistic-missile strike amid rising tensions with North Korea, seems to have sparked an unusually rapid response on Capitol Hill.

Hawaii’s Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, told National Journal that he is working with other Senate Democrats on a bill that would implement a federal best-practice framework for the ballistic-missile-alert systems administered by U.S. states, localities, and territories. And while Republicans don’t appear to be involved in the process, relevant GOP chairs in both chambers have expressed a willingness to work with Schatz on the issue.

Initial reports indicate that Hawaii’s screwup—which sent people across the archipelago scrambling for shelter before the all-clear was called more than a half-hour later—was because of an employee mistakenly pressing the wrong link on a confusingly designed interface. But for something as serious as a ballistic-missile alert, Schatz suggested that the potential for human error can, and should, be mitigated through federal safeguards.

“You want a system that accounts for the fact that somebody may be sleepy or careless, or an interface may not be the most user-friendly, and yet it all works anyway,” Schatz said. “We have best practices for disaster notifications for natural disasters, for terrorism events. We just don’t have it for this.”

On Wednesday, Schatz said he had convened a phone call with officials from the Federal Communications Commission, the Homeland Security Department, the Pentagon, and other relevant agencies to address the inconsistency.

“We think it should be done legislatively, but I don’t know that for sure yet,” he told reporters, explaining that the ultimate goal is to craft “a federal law to establish a framework that states can use.”

The way America’s missile-alert system operates is fundamentally different from how citizens are alerted to most other catastrophes, when local authorities often possess the best information. While states and cities are ultimately responsible for alerting civilians of an imminent attack, they lack the ability to detect and track incoming missiles.

In the seconds and minutes after a launch, details of the threat would have to cascade through phone calls from the Pentagon to DHS. From there, officials at the Federal Emergency Management Agency would send the warning to at-risk states and localities, whose own alert systems would only then spring into life.

That chain of causation was disrupted on Saturday. But David Simpson, a former admiral in the U.S. Navy who ran the FCC’s Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau from November 2013 to January 2017, said federal legislation should seek to dismantle that outdated process altogether.

“That’s a 1950s kind of structure,” Simpson said, arguing that machine-to-machine communication technology should be utilized to eliminate lag time and cut down on human error.

One way to do that could be for the FCC to create, at the direction of Congress, a unique wireless-alert category for ballistic-missile threats. “That would then ensure that the machine elements of this system could be built around that narrow bucket,” Simpson said.

But that still wouldn’t solve the problem entirely. “The machine-to-machine piece of that, so it could be really useful, would require DHS and [Defense Department] plumbing changes that would be beyond the authorities of the FCC,” Simpson said.

Simpson largely endorsed Schatz’s plan for a uniform federal missile-alert framework that states and localities can follow. “There’s over 1,000 alert originators at the state and local level, and I would say five, six, seven vendors for the user-interface systems,” he said.

In a bid to improve innovation, DHS gave state governments broad leeway to design their own missile-alert interfaces. But Simpson said that decision has clearly come with a cost.

“That variation is fine for notification about fire, notification about a tsunami coming in,” Simpson said. “But ballistic-missile warnings ought to be consistent, reliable, secure—because we don’t want it cyberattacked—across the entire country.”

Republicans seem receptive to Schatz’s plan for missile-alert legislation. Schatz said he plans to introduce his bill through the Senate Commerce Committee, which is chaired by Republican John Thune. Frederick Hill, a Thune spokesman, told National Journal that the chairman “is considering convening a full committee hearing which would help inform legislative efforts.”

House Republicans are further along than their Senate counterparts, with plans to hold an Energy and Commerce hearing on Hawaii’s false missile alert in the coming weeks. On Wednesday, committee chairman Greg Walden said he would be “happy to work” with Schatz on legislation, if needed. “We just haven’t got into the weeds on it,” Walden said.

As long as lawmakers can work out issues surrounding committee and agency jurisdiction, Simpson said the chances for bipartisan support are high. But stakeholders from Homeland Security and the Pentagon—as well as the congressional committees that oversee them—will also need to weigh in. And Simpson worries those agencies may be loath to take responsibility for what’s widely viewed as a state-level mistake.

“It’s a perfect bipartisan issue, as long as we don’t let the various lobbies and the competition between agencies pervert and potentially dilute the ultimate outcome,” Simpson said.

""Two more House Republicans have joined the discharge petition to force votes on immigration, potentially leaving centrists just two signatures short of success. Reps. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) signed the discharge petition Thursday before the House left town for the Memorial Day recess. If all Democrats endorse the petition, just two more GOP signatures would be needed to reach the magic number of 218.""

"Sun aims powerful flares at Earth

(CNN) -- The sun should place the Earth squarely in its
sights this week as it aims its solar ray gun. Astronomers
tell terrestrial dwellers not to sweat it too much, despite
the fact that solar activity is approaching an 11-year peak.

Two large sunspots moving across the surface of the sun are
expected to directly face the Earth soon for up to several
days, according to solar scientists. Such sunspots often
herald powerful coronal mass ejections and solar flares,
space storms that can disrupt weather and electrical systems
on Earth.

Solar flares are the largest explosions in the solar system.
A typical one can release the energy equivalent of millions
of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at once.

Highly charged particles from large flares can overload power
grids and damage satellites. In 1989, one space storm knocked
out a major power plant in Canada, leaving millions without
power for hours.

Solar activity generally waxes and wanes during an 11-year
cycle and astronomers expect it to peak either this or next
year. But so far, the sun has produced only a ""disappointing""
level of fireworks, said Joseph Gurman, a solar physicist who
analyzes data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.

Coronal mass ejections are much more likely to produce
effects, Gurman said. Like flares, they send streams of highly
charged particles, but they also can emit a billion tons of
plasma, or ionized gas.

Fortunately the Earth's magnetosphere usually bears the brunt
of plasma particles. ""If we were exposed to them, we
literally would be fried,"" Gurman said.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"When Rudy Gay left the game with a left knee injury late in the first quarter, memories of the Sacramento Kings’ (16-22) recent poor play minus a star resurfaced. The thought came to fruition as DeMarcus Cousins joined him on the sidelines in the waning seconds of regulation, and the short-handed Kings fell to the visiting Dallas Mavericks (27-12), 108-104.

The Kings are currently 2-2 on their six-game home stand and return to action on Friday in a contest against the Miami Heat. Join Cowbell Kingdom’sJames Ham as he recaps the action from the floor of Sleep Train Arena.

Golden State Warriors Projected Starters (31-22)

What to watch

1. Can the Kings win without DeMarcus Cousins?

The Kings are 0-7 without their starting center and it looks like Cousins will miss another game on Wednesday with a strained left hip flexor. Andrew Bogut is questionable for the Warrior with left shoulder inflammation, as is reserve Jermaine O’Neal (sore back). This game might turn into a track meet, which doesn’t bode well for Sacramento.

2. Can the Kings defend the 3-point line?

Sacramento ranks 28th in the league against the long ball. The Warriors starting backcourt of Curry and Thompson have already shot close to 800 3-pointers on the season. If the Kings don’t stay with Golden State’s shooters, they have very little chance of pulling off the upset.

3. How do the Kings players handle the trade rumors?

The trade deadline is 12pm PST on Thursday and the rumors are swirling. Do the Kings players crumble under the pressure or do they come out swinging in what might be their last game in Sacramento?

According to an NBA source, Sacramento Kings point guard Isaiah Thomas underwent an MRI earlier Tuesday on his left wrist. Counter to other media reports, the results of the tests were negative and Thomas is not expected to miss any time with the injury.

Since taking over the starting position 35 games ago, Thomas is averaging 21.5 points, 6.9 assists and 1.3 steals per game in 37.5 minutes. But rumors that he was having some discomfort in his wrist began a few weeks back.

Recently, his shooting numbers have taken a dramatic dip, beginning in January when he shot just 41.2 percent from the field and 32.7 percent from long range. Thomas’s overall field goal percentage has bounced back in the month of February, but his 3-point percentage for the seven games this month is 24.1 percent.

Thomas and rookie guard Ben McLemore were the subject of a trade rumor on Monday, but coach Michael Malone and general manager Pete D’Alessandro refuted the reports following practice on Tuesday afternoon.

“The report that was, I think on Yahoo!, about our offer to Boston was so erroneous and I don’t know where it came from,” Malone told reporters on Tuesday. “We dispel the rumors that are out there that we know are not true, but at the same time, this is a business and you have no idea what can happen up until trade deadline. I think all of our players realize that.”

With injuries and possible trade rumors swirling, it should be a wild couple of days in Sacramento.

DeMarcus Cousins Injury Update

Thomas wasn’t the only Kings player to undergo an MRI today. For the second straight day, center DeMarcus Cousins made a trip to the doctors office for testing. Results of the first MRI were inconclusive, but a second test confirmed the Kings medical staff’s earlier diagnosis of a strained left hip flexor.

Cousins has been unable to participate in practice since returning from the All-Star break. He is listed as day-to-day, but considered doubtful for Wednesday’s match-up against the Golden State Warriors.

Hamady Ndiaye out of Rutgers and DeQuan Jones out of Florida are the only late additions. Ndiaye was in camp last season with Sacramento and left a solid impression. After being waived by the Kings, the 26-year old center spent last season playing for Tianjin Ronggang Golden Lions of the Chinese Basketball Association.

Jones played in 63 games last season with the Orlando Magic, including 17 starts. He averaged 3.7 points per game in a little under 13 minutes a game.

Last season it was high ropes courses in Colorado Springs, Co. This year, the Sacramento Kings open training camp away from home again, but instead of the Team USA practice facility in Colorado, it will be on the sandy beaches of Santa Barbara, CA. Camp will run from Oct. 1-6 at the Pavilion Gym on the University of California, Santa Barbara campus.

The team will head back to Northern California for their pre-season opener on the road against the Golden State Warriors on October 7, before heading to Las Vegas to take on the Lakers on Oct. 10.

After the initial week away, the Kings will continue camp in Sacramento at the team’s practice facility in Natomas.

But there’s probably no other player more overlooked and underrated on this season’s roster than the fourth-year guard. Just look no further than ESPN.com’s annual NBA Rank, which appraises the value of the league’s top 500 players. The 25-year-old guard moved up just five spots (no. 136 in 2011 to no. 131 in 2012) in this year’s rankings. These were the five players ranked just ahead of Thornton in the 2012 forecast:

Such is life on a bad team with little to no national exposure. However, those who follow the Kings closely know just how valuable Thornton is, especially his competition.

“He’s become an outstanding scorer in this league,” said Dallas Mavericks guard Darren Collisonback in January of his former New Orleans Hornets teammate. “He’s definitely made a niche in this league as far as (being) a big time scorer.

“He can shoot the ball extremely well and he can do a lot of different things off the pick and roll,” added Collison. “And he’s exceptionally quick too.”

In their rookie year, Collison and Thornton formed an explosive and exciting young backcourt for the Hornets. Though they’ve since gone their separate ways, the two remain close. Thornton worked out last offseason with Collison in Los Angeles during the lockout.

The fourth-year guard out of UCLA thinks Sacramento is a good fit for his old teammate. He believes Thornton will only continue to improve with the Kings’ green nucleus.

“This is a young team that’s going to be good in the near future,” Collison said. “He has a starting role here, so anytime you have a starting role, it’s always a good fit. And he’s one of their best scorers, too.”

Averaging 18.7 points per game, Thornton led the Kings in scoring last season and usually found himself as their go-to-guy in clutch situations. The next step for Thornton, according to another former teammate, is becoming an accomplished defender.

“He’s always been a capable scorer,” said Indiana Pacers big man David West. “Key for him has always been for him to play as hard defensively as he does offensively.”

As explosive as he is with the ball, Thornton could stand to see some improvement on the defensive end. The Louisiana native finished in the bottom three among his 15 teammates in defensive rating.

“We would challenge him to do the same thing on the defensive end,” said West of his days with Thornton in New Orleans. “Make him more of a complete ball player.”

However like Collison, West thinks Thornton will continue to find success in the league.

“He’s a strong-minded, tough-minded kid,” West said. “I knew that once he got an opportunity to just get in a system that worked for him and bring out his best skills, he’d do well.”

The Kings may not belong to Marcus Thornton. But his importance to their success isn’t an understatement.

Twenty-five years ago today, Sacramento Kings Head Coach Keith Smart hit a shot that changed his life forever.

No matter where I go, people talk about it. Once they recognize me or see a nametag on my bag or something like that, they start talking about “The Shot”. So it’s a great moment and I’m glad it went in, but wasn’t just something for me.

We just had our 25 year championship reunion. And we all got together and it wasn’t so much what we all did in the tournament and our careers. It was a friendship and a relationship that we have now that that moment brings us all together.

"A VISUALLY STUNNING architectural biography of Minnesota’s most influential architect of the twentieth century. Architect, artist, furniture designer, and educator, Ralph Rapson has played a leading role in the development and practice of modern architecture and design, both nationally and internationally.

“Ralph Rapson is now a legend in the history of modern architecture.”
—Cesar Pelli, FAIA

REVIEW:

Barbara Flanagan/The New York Times

Ralph Rapson is best known as the designer of the Gutherie, Minneapolis’s landmark of theater design, but because he worked, taught and competed with most of the world’s first modernists–Wright, Mies, Corbusier, Saarinen–his elder son and biographer calls him “the Forest Gump of architecture.”

Ralph Rapson: Sixty Years of Modern Design, by Rip Rapson, Jane King Hession and Bruce N. Wright, documents the architect’s vast career and uncanny associations.

Rapson believed design should be reflect the moment–furniture, houses, cities–but his take on modernism was never pompous. He perpetuated endless ideas–still fresh–vibrant drawings and youthful pranks. (He had his students hoist famous visitors upside down, including the stocky Buckminister Fuller, and footprint the ceiling with their bare soles.) The book shows how one can be talented, influential and happy, all the while remaining internationally obscure. It also tells, discreetly, how one man can achieve all this single-handedly: with his right forearm amputated at birth, Ralph Rapson drew with his left hand.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"From the mid-1960's until the close of that decade, automobiles became lighter, more compact, and more powerful. Auto manufacturers continued to compete against one another for drag-strip supremacy. As government regulations and safety concerns increased, the muscle car era began to decline rapidly.

Many of these ultimate high-performance muscle cars were built to satisfy homologation requirements. Others were built just to have the fastest machine on the road. The Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda is an example of one of the fiercest and most powerful vehicle ever constructed for the roadway. It was derived from the lesser Barracuda's which began in the mid-1960's. It was built atop the 'E' body platform and was restyled in 1970 by John Herlitz, making it longer, wider, and lower. The 426 cubic-inch Hemi V8 was capable of producing an astonishing 425 horsepower. Matted to a four-speed manual 833 transmission, this was the ultimate muscle car of its day.

This 1971 Plymouth Hemi 'Cuda Convertible with black paint and orange billboards was offered for sale at the 2006 RM Auction in Monterey, CA where it was expected to sell between $180,000-$220,000. It came equipped from the factory with power windows, power brakes, power steering, Rally instrument cluster, rim blow steering wheel, bucket seats, AM/FM cassette radio, and driving lights. It has a Dana '60' rear end and the 426 cu in engine. It is one of just 374 'Cda Convertibles built in 1971. On auction day bidding reached $165,000 which was not high enough to satisfy reserve. The vehicle was left unsold.By Daniel Vaughan | Dec 2006

This 'Cuda Convertible was given a show-quality restoration to original specifications and is one of just 374 examples originally produced for the 1971 model year. It is believed to be one of just 87 383-powered convertibles produced for the last year of 'Cuda convertible production in 1971. The 383 cubic-inch V8 has four-barrel carburetors and is capable of producing 300 horsepower. There is a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic gearbox and four-wheel hydraulic brakes.

The car is finished in Tawny Gold, with a white interior and a white power-operated convertible top. Features include dual chrome-tipped exhaust outlets, floor console, hood pins, power brakes, power steering, Rallye wheels, a 'Slap Stik' shifter and a 'Tuff' steering wheel.

In 2010, this 'Cuda Convertible was offered for sale at the Vintage Motor Cars of Meadow Brook presented by RM Auctions. The car was estimated to sell for $60,000 - $70,000. As bidding came to a close, the car had been sold for the sum of $44,000 including buyer's premium.By Daniel Vaughan | Aug 2010

V8 Cuda Convertible

The 3rd generation Barracuda ran from 1970 through 1974; the previous generations were A-body Valiant based which began in 1964. Designed by John E. Herlitz on the 108-inch wheelbase, unibody, E-platform, a shorter and wider version of the existing B-body. This example has the non-Hemi 340 cubic-inch V8 with automatic and it is a stock example. 1971 was the only year for four headlamps. Somehow, this model series didn't sell to expectation and production slowed over the years, making the cars quite rare today. An unaltered car is even more rare.

V8 Cuda Hard Top Coupe

The writing was on the wall by 1971 for the muscle car enthusiast. With rising gas prices and skyrocketing insurance rates, the days of the overpowered and often low priced performance automobile were numbered. For the big three, it seems that the decision was made to go out with a bang, and some of the rarest and most desirable muscle cars ever to come out of the Motor City were produced.

Among the hottest is the Hemi 'Cuda, produced for a mere two model years. In 1970, it is believed that Plymouth produced just 696 Hemi 'Cuda hardtops and for 1971, a mere 118 would leave the line.

Wild colors would survive for the 1971 model year and Chrysler would lead the pack with their Hi-Impact color palate. Several eye popping colors were offered, including Sassy Grass Green as seen on this example, which is one of the rarest offerings.

When it comes to American Muscle, the Plymouth hemi 'Cuda is always at the top of the list. And when it comes to rarity and desirability, nothing compares to a 1971 Hemi ' Cuda.

No matter what make or model you may prefer, there is no disputing the visual impact of the 426 Street Hemi engine. With the massive valve covers and the huge dual quad carbs, it certainly takes top honors when it comes to intimidation. To add the outrageous FC7 in Violet, (aka Plum Crazy) paint to the mix is to take things a step beyond.

This 1971 Hemi 'Cuda exemplifies what Mopar Performance was all about in the final years of the original Muscle Car era. With a mere 107 leaving the Hamtramck, Michigan assembly plant with the Hemi engine under the shaker hood, these cars were rare even when new. This car is one of just 48 equipped with the Torqueflite automatic transmission and it also features the rare leather interior, elastomeric color keyed bumpers, power steering and power front disc brakes, a center console, the AM radio with the Dictaphone cassette recorder, tinted glass, dual color keyed mirrors and more, making it one of the highest option 1971 Hemi 'Cuda's in existence.

Of course, when new these cars were flogged not only on the street, but at the tracks throughout the country, making this example among the most sought after and valuable American muscle cars ever built.

The first series of the Barracuda was produced from 1964 through 1969, distinguished by its A-body construction. From 1970 through 1974 the second series was produced using an E-body construction.

In 1964, Plymouth offered the Barracuda as an option of the Valiant model line, meaning it wore both the Valiant and Barracuda emblems. The base offering was a 225 cubic-inch six-cylinder engine that produced with 180 horsepower. An optional Commando 273 cubic-inch eight-cylinder engine was available with a four-barrel carburetor, high-compression heads and revised cams. The vehicle was outfitted with a live rear axle and semi-elliptic springs. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was introduced at the same time, separated by only two weeks, as the Ford Mustang. The Mustang proved to be the more popular car outselling the Valiant Barracuda by a ratio of 8 to 1.

The interior was given a floor-shifter, vinyl semi-bucket seats, and rear seating. The rear seats folded down allowing ample space for cargo.

By 1967, Plymouth redesigned the Barracuda and added a coupe and convertible to the model line-up. To accommodate larger engines, the engine bay was enlarged. There were multiple engine offerings that ranged in configuration and horsepower ratings. The 225 cubic-inch six-cylinder was the base engine while the 383 cubic-inch 8-cylinder was the top-of-the-line producing 280 horsepower. That was impressive, especially considering the horsepower to weight ratio. Many chose the 340 cubic-inch eight-cylinder because the 383 and Hemi were reported to make the Barracuda nose-heavy while the 340 offered optimal handling.

In 1968 Plymouth offered a Super Stock 426 Hemi package. The lightweight body and race-tuned Hemi were perfect for the drag racing circuit. Glass was replaced with lexan, non-essential items were removed, and lightweight seats with aluminum brackets replaced the factory bench, and were given a sticker that indicated the car was not to be driven on public highways but for supervised acceleration trials. The result was a car that could run the quarter mile in the ten-second range.

For 1969 a limited number of 440 Barracudas were produced, giving the vehicle a zero-to-sixty time of around 5.6 seconds.

In 1970 the Barracuda were restyled but shared similarities to the 1967 through 1969 models. The Barracuda was available in convertible and hardtop configuration; the fastback was no longer offered. Sales were strong in 1970 but declined in the years that followed. The muscle car era was coming to a close due to the rising government safety and emission regulations and insurance premiums. Manufacturers were forced to detune their engines. The market segment was slowly shifting from muscle-cars to luxury automobiles. 1974 was the final year Plymouth offered the Barracuda.By Daniel Vaughan | Aug 2010

despite prior CIBC polls showing debt repayment as the top priority for
Canadians in 2013.

Highlights of the poll include:

71 per cent of Canadians said they currently carry some form of debt, in line with
the national average in a similar poll conducted last year (72 per cent)

Among Canadians with debt, 21 per cent say their level of debt has increased in the last 12 months, while
another 28 per cent say their debt level has stayed the same - which indicates nearly half (49 per cent) of Canadians with debt did not make progress towards paying it down in
the past year

The top reason cited for not making progress on debt reduction was not
having the money to do so

50 per cent said they have reduced their debt in the last year

""Though Canadians have identified paying down debt as their top
financial priority for the past three years, our poll shows almost an
even split between those who are making strides and those who aren't,""
said Christina Kramer, Executive Vice President, Retail Distribution
and Channel Strategy, CIBC. ""Today's historically low interest rates
represent a real opportunity to reduce your total debt level, however
to take advantage of these low rates it is critical that Canadians have
a plan to make that happen.""

CIBC's annual Financial Priorities Poll, released in January 2013, found
that paying down debt was the top financial priority of Canadians for
the third consecutive year.

""Not Having the Money"" Cited as Top Reason for not Making Progress

Among those Canadians who said they aren't making progress on debt
repayment, the top reason provided was they don't have the money to put
against what they owe (29 per cent), followed by unplanned expenses which affected their ability to pay
more towards their debt (12 per cent).

A CIBC study from earlier this year shows that despite being a financial
priority, debt is not top of mind when it comes to getting advice. When
Canadians were asked what topics come to mind about a conversation they
may have with an advisor, only 6 per cent cited debt.

""It can be challenging to find the money each month to put towards
reducing your debt, but our poll clearly shows that many Canadians are
doing just that despite having the same everyday financial pressures of
those who say they are not making progress,"" said Ms. Kramer.

She noted that with many Canadians avoiding conversations about debt
management, they are missing an opportunity to get personalized advice
and put a plan in place.

""You should talk with an advisor about your debt management goals the
same way you would talk to them about your goals for retirement,
because your finances are all connected,"" added Ms. Kramer. ""A
conversation with an advisor can lead to a plan that puts on you on
track to achieve your broader financial goals.""

Advice on Managing Debt:

CIBC offers these tips to help Canadians take charge of their finances
and reduce debt as part of their long term financial plan.

Make lump sum payments to higher interest debt first to reduce interest
costs

If you have debt, work with an advisor to structure it to minimize your
overall interest costs by utilizing debt products that offer a lower
interest rate and having a strategy to pay these balances down in a
specific time frame

While interest rates remain near historic lows, don't ignore the long
term benefits of making small adjustments to your payment today.
Setting your debt payment even slightly higher than your required
payment can reduce your overall interest costs and help you become debt
free faster

Use free budgeting tools to help you stay on budget - CIBC CreditSmart,
available to CIBC credit card holders, allows you to set customized
budgets and receive spend alerts if you exceed your planned budget for
the month, helping you stay on top of your everyday budgeting and
saving

"OS 10.2 - Permanently deleting emails and files

This is my first time posting so I hope I don't screw this up...Does anyone have any advice on how to permanently delete emails and files? I am running on OS X 10.3.9 and have deleted files in my trash using the secure empty trash function, however, I have a large number of emails I have deleted in Mail. Are these permenently deleted as well? Secondly, is some of the shareware or freeware out there such as Shredit any good? I have a concern that someone is going to try and retrieve deleted data off my computer sometime soon and I really don't want any emails/files showing up that I have deleted.

If you are using Mail as your email client and you account is setup as a pop3 account not leaving a copy on the server and your mac is not remotely backed up and your home folder is local then your mail lives in /Users/username/Library/Mail. Using the erase deleted messages from the mailbox menu will get rid of your mail. Will it be recoveerable from a drive recovery company,...possibly. Your company on the other handprobably not.

"The bantamweight champion of DEEP, Takafumi Otsuka, will take on Koichi Ishiuzka on May 13th at Differ Ariake in Tokyo.

Otsuka was supposed to fight Fernando Vieira for the WSOF-GC bantamweight title in December. However, the Brazilian was over the weight at the first weigh-in and never showed up at the second weigh-in. Vieira was nowhere to be found after this.The Brazilian basically fled from the entire show.

Otsuka became the inaugural WSOF-GC champ but this means, the last time he fought was back in August of last year. That was, however, against a Mongolian fighter named Baataryn Azjavkhlan who was 1-0 at the time.

In terms of competitive fight, vs Daisuke Engo in February 2016 maybe is the last time Otsuka went through, which is more than a year ago.

Ishizuka is basically born and raised in DEEP.

And, he is undefeated in the last ten fights.

For Ishizuka, this must be the opportunity he has been looking for all of his pro MMA career.

So, Ishizuka has to be motivated than ever.

The only concern is, his recent changes in the training environment. In last year, Ishizuka moved to Aichi because of the job which forced him to leave team Brightness Monma. And, Ishizuka joined team ALIVE which is based in Aichi prefecture.

But Ishizuka left ALIVE now, and his status is “independent.”

Besides this title fight between Otsuka and Ishizuka, men’s strawweight bout between Haruo Ochi and “Rambo” Kosuke is also confirmed.

These two met all the way back in May of 2011.

This fight took place in Shooto.

“Rambo” almost caught Ochi with an armbar in the first round. But Ochi came back and KO’d Kosuke in the second round. That was “Rambo”‘s first pro defeat in seven fights.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"How Idris Elba's 'Luther' Puts Us in the Mindset of a Renegade Detective

""Luther"" is a series about righteous indignation. Yes, it's a police drama, a dark (sometimes ludicrously so) crime saga set in a moody London with a greater and grimmer murder rate to equal that of other bleak procedurals.

Yes, it's a police drama, a dark (sometimes ludicrously so) crime saga set in a moody version of London with a greater and grimmer murder rate to equal that of other bleak procedurals. But the satisfaction of seeing those cases solved, those murderers and kidnappers caught, is muted, secondary to the suffering and sacrifice and validation of protagonist John Luther, the detective played by Idris Elba with a staggering display of movie star charisma that seems like it ought to produce static shocks with everything with which he comes into contact. Luther's devoted to his job with an obsessiveness that's destroying him, that, as the series began in 2010, had ended his marriage and eaten him up inside, changing him. He's good at what he does, if prone to extremes, and yet he seems to be perpetually doubted, maligned and hurt because of it.

In season one, Luther was framed for the murder of his beloved wife and forced to run from his fellow officers, and it's not the only time in the series he's a suspect. In season two he's treated like a certain career contaminant by a new, ambitious, by-the-books officer assigned to report to him. And in the four-episode third season airing on BBC America from September 3 through 6, that former colleague, DS Erin Gray (Nikki Amuka-Bird), is targeting him as part of an investigation of police corruption with DSU George Stark (David O'Hara), who may be a little obsessive himself. Aside from his sidekick DS Justin Ripley (Warren Brown), few seem to appreciate Luther and his incredible abilities -- instead, he's infamous, the rest of the police force apparently all too able of believing he's capable of dark things.

We, as viewers, don't, because of Idris Elba. John Luther is Elba's best role since that of the fascinatingly savvy Stringer Bell in ""The Wire,"" because it showcases the actor's utterly assured presence, his air of rakishly rumpled confidence in his tweed coat. Luther does not have swagger, he has conviction, conviction that informs his every -- frequently correct -- move. It's why it's so easy to trust him in a way that the characters working with him don't, and not without reason. When the series began in 2010, it was with Luther letting a pedophile fall to what could have been his death after extracting from him information about the location of the girl he'd kidnapped. It didn't doom his career -- he got lucky -- but he hasn't really changed. He even threatens a suspect with a similar fate toward the start of the new season -- but the move doesn't come across as harsh. We're more worried, when it happens, that it'll get him in trouble again.

""Luther"" is mesmerizing because of Elba, and because the show is so consumed by his performance that it becomes not one about a maverick cop but instead one of a man outpacing the justice system he's allegedly a part of, one that hampers him with its pesky rules, its politics and its skeptics. It encourages us to buy into his worldview, in which he should just be allowed to do his job and get justice done, though that may mean covering up crimes or allowing culprits he's judged deserving to go free -- like Alice Morgan (Ruth Wilson), his psychopathic superhero of a friend, and a wonderful, preposterous character who's essentially too enjoyable to be locked up. Luther's tactics make him so dangerous to the people around him that the case Stark tries to build against him is based on the peripheral body count rather than evidence, and when, in the new season, he starts a tentative romance with Mary Day (Sienna Guillory), a woman another character dismissively sums up as a ""pixie,"" it's accompanied by a sense of dread.

The series comes close to confronting the nature of its protagonist in the new season, introducing a grieving man who turns to vigilanteism and gathers public support for his actions as he starts targeting rapists and killers who've gotten off lightly. Confronting Luther on opposite sides of a canal, the man says ""One out of five murders are committed by men on bail,"" and demands to know why nothing is being done about it. ""It's complicated,"" Luther replies. ""No, it's not,"" says the man. ""No... it's not. You've got me there,"" Luther admits. The difference is that, while Luther may bend the rules to fit his ideas about crime and punishment, he doesn't do so looking for outside approval the way the antagonist he's facing down does -- the opposite, really. Instead, it's the viewers who seethe on his behalf and yearn for his efforts to continue, and it's that conflicting emotion far more than the procedural aspects that lifts ""Luther"" above the plethora of similarly lurid recent dark crime dramas it resembles.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"My Hero Academia Season 2- Episode 18

After last weeks episode, I was really curious what they had in store for us this week. How the heroes will come back to Earth after such a traumatic experience. And good thing for us, this episode is rightly named “The Aftermath of Hero Killer: Stain”.

My Hero Academia- Funimation

We open with Izuku, Iida, and Todoroki all in the hospital. They are all recovering from their tremendous fight. But also reflecting how lucky they are to be alive still. The door opens and we see Gran Torino and Pro Hero Manual. First thing Gran Torino does of course is scold Midoriya. But before Gran Torino goes full instructor on him, he tells the boys that they have a visitor.

My Hero Academia- Funimation

A tall figure turns the corner wearing a professional business suit. It’s Hosu’s chief of police, Kenji Tsuragamae. Who also happens to look like a dog (just go along with it I guess?). Kenji tells the boys that Stain is in custody and is being treated for several broken bones and serious burns. He also reminds them that what they have done was not okay on paper. Uncertified heroes using their Quirks against their instructors orders is highly frowned upon. But Todoroki is not taking it. He tells the chief that if Iida didn’t step in, then Pro Hero Native would have been killed. And the both of them would have been killed without Izuku’s help. But Gran Torino tells Todoroki to hear the chief out.

Kenji tells them that the punishment would only happen if this was made public. And the people would applaud their efforts anyway. But if the police kept it quiet, no one gets punished, but the boys don’t get the praise they deserve. Instead Endeavor will get the praise from the masses. It would also explain Stain’s burn scars. So they choose to not be celebrated as heroes and apologize anyways. But Kenji tells them he respects what they did and he thanks them for protecting the peace.

So it has hit the news that Endeavor has stopped hero killer Stain and the nomus from destroying Hosu City. It’s all anyone is talking about. Meanwhile, we get a look at how everyone else from Class 1-A is doing in their internship programs. First we look at Bakugo who is having a less than stellar time. The first thing he wants to do is go knock some heads around but his mentor is not allowing him and says it will be business as usual. Hopefully that could help Bakugo control his temper. Kirishima finds out the reason why Midoriya sent him his location. Apparently he also reported the incident last night. Go Kirishima! Momo debuted in a commercial with her mentor and it seems obvious modelling is not what she wants to be doing. But her mentor is letting her go on patrol like she has wanted since the start of their training together.

My Hero Academia- Funimation

And finally there is Uraraka who is on the phone with Midoriya. She tells him how glad she is that they are all safe. Midoriya of course apologizes for not contacting sooner but she understands. In the midst of the conversation, Uraraka’s mentor Gunhead reminds her that they are going to start their basic training. She then says bye to Midoriya and Gunhead asks in a very cute way, “Your boyfriend?”. And she immediately dismisses it. When Midoriya hangs up he gets all worked up that he talked to a girl on the phone. This scene was my favorite from this episode it had me busting up!

We get back to the guys in the hospital and Iida comes out and tells the two that he may have long-term damage in his hand. But he reflects on his actions from that night and regrets them greatly. He shouldn’t have acted so swiftly and carelessly. But Midoriya doesn’t let Iida beat himself up too much. He agrees that him and Iida should get stronger together.

My Hero Academia- Funimation

We cut to U.A. with All Might in the staff room. He gets a phone call from Gran Torino. He tells All Might that he has had his teaching licence revoked for six months because of Midoriya’s actions but there was no way of avoiding that and that he has come to terms with it. But All Might is very ashamed of himself for letting down his former instructor. But this isn’t the reason Gran Torino called. He really wants to talk about Stain. He says in the few minutes he was with him, it had him trembling. It was because of how intimidating and obsessed he was on what he think a hero should be and what he will do to correct our society. Because this has hit so many news stations, Stains ideology and opinions will be put on blast. People will become influenced by Stain’s beliefs and become a plague. But All Might doesn’t believe it will be a problem because they will probably show up sporadically and they will be taken out 1 by 1. But this is where the League of Villains comes in. If they all combine their hatred and Shigaraki gives them an outlet to express and deal with their evil intentions, it will become a serious problem. Gran Torino then reminds All Might that he must tell Midoriya properly what is concerning him and One for All. Which I have no idea what that is all about. Apparently the quirk is “on the move”? I’m interested in what that might mean.

This episode was mostly a lot of dialogue and context but it was needed after such a shift in the story. It was refreshing getting some insight on how everyone else is doing too. I’m hoping next time they elaborate on what is concerning All Might and what is happening with his quirk? Only time will tell.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Vale de Lua – Moon Surface on Earth

The valley terrain is all covered with rock formations and intricate labyrinths created by nature. In ancient times, there were deposits of quartz. But the noisy river San Miguel has streamed lots of passages over the years.

Now, quartz rocks hang over the pond and the holes of different shapes remind those seen on the moon. Due to the different degrees of refraction of light water in some places seems to be dark blue, in other - clear and transparent. Dark brown and almost black, sometimes bluish-gray rocks vary in height and shape.

Such miracle undoubtedly shows that the forces of nature are capable of creating the most unusual landscapes. In Brazil, Vale de Lua unusual relief appeared also due to the presence of sand. Gradually, layer after layer, it was brought there with river’s stream, settled on the coastal cliffs and formed numerous mounds an unusual shape.

"The Doom Generation (1995)

October 25, 1995

FILM REVIEW;Gory Kitsch in a Parody of Teen-Age Road Movies

By JANET MASLIN

Published: October 25, 1995

Production notes for Gregg Araki's ""Doom Generation"" say it is ""Araki's first big-budget feature and marks the end of his film adolescence."" Well, not exactly. After a promising debut with ""The Living End"" followed by the angrier, more marginalized ""Totally F***ed Up,"" Mr. Araki is still sounding a note of self-congratulatory teen-age rebellion in a film gruesome and obvious enough to make ""Natural Born Killers"" look like a model of restraint.

It's not even much of a change to find ""The Doom Generation"" billed as ""a heterosexual movie,"" since it shares the effective homoerotic energy of his earlier work. That this film includes a teen-age girl, Amy Blue (Rose McGowan), as part of its sexual menage only means one especially clear target of contempt (""Don't get your uterus all tied in a knot"" is one of the more printable things anyone says to her) in a film overflowing with it. Amy's insolence and Anna Karina hairdo (like Uma Thurman's in ""Pulp Fiction"") may offer a touch of Godard. But this film's satire of teen-age-wasteland cinema is so coarsely exaggerated that any homage is beside the point.

Using outlaw characters named Red, White and Blue to condemn all aspects of unhip America, Mr. Araki indulges in such broad parody that thinking it clumsy means failure to get the joke. Though visibly more polished than his earlier films, ""The Doom Generation"" clings to a midnight movie sensibility founded on deliberate kitsch. So Amy is a one-note, rude, sulky heroine, saying things like ""Life is lonely, boring and dumb"" while the two men she's sleeping with enjoy an obvious attraction to each other. Not content to leave this as subtext, Mr. Araki throws in the occasional bumper sticker: ""Ditch the bitch. Make the switch.""

Voluptuous Xavier Red (Johnathon Schaech) is way ahead of charmingly dim Jordan White (James Duval) in getting the hint about this, but it doesn't matter: ""The Doom Generation"" leads them both to a gory demonstration of America's intolerance toward sexual nonconformists. Obscured by strobe lights and boosted by the alternative-rock soundtrack that's sure to help sell the movie, this already notorious castration sequence is one of several gross-out epiphanies here. Others include the severing of a head that still talks, and even vomits, after it is removed from a vein-spurting body, and a blink-of-the-eye cameo by Heidi Fleiss.

The genuine enthusiasm Mr. Araki brings to this film's bedroom scenes, with their whimsical sets and jokey porn ambiance, is matched by the occasionally workable black humor in his screenplay. (""You murdered two people tonight. Doesn't that faze you at all?"" ""Yeah, I'm bummed. To the max."") But sledgehammer direction, heavy irony and the easiest imaginable targets hardly show talent off to good advantage.

"4 ideas for improving your e-commerce ​website

2019 is here, and the new year provides an excellent opportunity to refresh your e-commerce website, by adding new features and updating content.

Adding web banners

Web banners are a great way to keep your e-commerce website homepage looking fresh, and making viewers aware of the latest news about products and offers. They can be easily modified to serve a range of purposes, are potentially eye-catching if they are placed in the appropriate area and are a good way of promoting a specific product or offer on a homepage while also retaining the core brand visuals elsewhere.

The image below is an example of a web banner in development. We’ve put together a handy guide for creating your banners – click here.

Adding new features

New features on your e-commerce website can add value through improved functionality, which in turn enhances the usability for customers and users. Features that allow for easy modification to products that they wish to purchase, such as different colours or quantities, or a social login function that enables users to create an account through their Facebook credentials.

Such responsive features make the e-commerce process as painless and easy-to-use as possible, limiting the barriers between browsing and purchase, in turn improving conversion rates and the chances of customers returning for more in the future.

A positive experience can often leave the customer wanting more, and it’s the websites job to ensure that their features and functionality are kept updated and fit for purpose, in response to the ever-changing demands of the modern e-commerce customer.

For example, one of the new features we’ve recently added from Amasty is the Social Login, which allows users to set up their account using login credentials from Facebook. To find out more about this feature, click here.

Improve optimisation

While you’re reading this, grab a smartphone or tablet and have a browse around your website.

How does it look?

Are the images stacked or overlapping, or is there text missing?

These issues mean your website has not been optimised for mobile devices, making it unusable for a large percentage of potential customers browsing with their iPhones or Samsungs. Users are extremely unlikely to want to fight through images and texts to find the products they want, and will quickly become frustrated and depart for a different site.

Don’t neglect these customers! Get your site optimised for different devices to reach as wide an audience as possible.

Data from 2018, shown below in the graph, from Statista.com, shows that 52.2% of all browsing online was done on a mobile device, a trend which has grown exponentially year-upon-year. This graph underlines the importance of ensuring that your website is fit for use for all potential users. You’re potentially missing out on reaching these customers if your site doesn’t meet their demands, and, with the trend of mobile browsing only set to rise, optimising your website to ensure it’s fit for use is quickly become a necessity for online retailers.

Our Liquidshop e-commerce platform is designed to provide the best user experience for your customers, though responsive e-commerce. Optimisation on devices of all sizes allows your website to be user-friendly for as many potential visitors as possible, expanding your reach and enhancing the user experience, leading to increased sales as part of the smooth and responsive overall e-commerce experience.

Keeping branding updated and consistent

There are few things more off-putting when navigating onto an e-commerce website that a poorly designed logo at the top of the page, or old, pixilated imagery taking up the homepage. A consistent brand image across the pages improves brand recognition for customers and gives the impression of a modern, well designed and cared for website and business as a whole.

You can also create special themed logos for holiday times such as Christmas or winter, like we did with our logo below.

What’s most important is too put time and effort into keeping your website updated. Whether that’s imagery, information or branding, putting the time into maintaining an attractive and cohesive e-commerce site means you keep your customers, and new visitors engaged and ensure that there as few barriers as possible between browsing and purchase.

"Update: Sree Narasimha Jayanthi – May 17th 2019

This day signifies the appearance of Lord Narasimha on the planet. Lord Narasimha is the fourth and the greatest incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is believed to have appeared to protect his devotee, Prahlada, from his father Hiranyakashyapu .

If you listen to the song ” Narashima Nembo davana” posted on youtube, there is a paragraph which explains how Lord Narashima came from the pillar. Hiranyakashyapu pointed out at a pillar in his palace and asked Prahalada whether Lord Vishnu was present in it pillar. Prahalada who was a great devotee said yes. Next, you know Hiranyakashyapu uses his Gadha and broke open the pillar and there emerged our Lord Narasimha who than slained Hiranyakashyapu using his sharp paws.

The day signifies the triumph of good over evil and the eagerness of the lord to protect his devotees from evil.

When my Parents visited us last year, my Father recited the “Bhagavatha Purana” for three weeks at my place. The way my Dad explained this part of the Purana, brings tears to my eyes every time I listen “Narashima Nembo Devana”. The greatest mistake I made was to not record the purana. Hopefully will record the next time my Father visits us.

About Narasimha Jayanthi: Ms. Lakshmi’s write up summary from the book “ಭಾರತೀಯ ಹಬ್ಬ ಹರಿದಿನಗಳು” by ಶ್ರೀ ಶ್ರೀ ರಂಗಪ್ರಿಯ ಮಹಾದೇಷಿಕ ಸ್ವಾಮಿಗಳು.

“The pillar in evil Hiranyakashipu’s royal court, signifies the ṃērusthambha, the central backbone system. Through the central nervous system called ṣuśumna, the brilliant light emanated. The energy associated came out in its full fierce glory as Narasimha and later transformed into the peaceful form after the destruction of evil force.”

When is Narasimha Jayanthi celebrated?
Narasimha Jayanthi is one of the important festivals of Vaiśnavas. It is
celebrated in the vaiśāka māsam,on ṣukla pakśa chaturdaśi, after akśhaya thrithēya, svāti nakśatra, siddha Yōga, vanija karanam. The date is determined according to chāndramāna system. Since the inception of this avatāram is in the evening, the worship is done in the evening. It is considered to be more auspicious if this day coincides with sōmavasarē, Monday or ṣanivasarē, Saturday. It is a sacred day to remember Lord Narasimha’s sarva vyāpakatva- all pervading – spiritual knowledge,
wealth, strength, valor, splendor, and compassion toward His devotees.

Which are the major manifestations of Lord Narasimha?

There are three major forms of Lord Narasimha.

1. Ugra-Narasimha – His fierce form: In this form He has conch – ṣanka, discus – chakra, mace – gada, bow – chāpa, bells – ghanta-, trident like – ankuśa, and his two hands ready to chisel the demon heart, as His āyudhams – weapons. This form is worshipped in the evenings.
2. Lakshmi Narasimha: In this form he is very peaceful – ṣanta – with His consort – Sri Lakshmi sitting on his left lap, with ādiseṣa on his head as umbrella, and Prahallāda standing in his front praying with his folded hands. This manifestation is followed after his fierce form– as a result, he is worshipped in the morning.
3. Yoga Narasimha – meditative: Here, He is in his Meditative form for those who aspire for results of Yoga.

– Incense, lamplight, flowers and ṣrigandha or perfume.-
tuḻasi or Holy Basil — Since he has the element of both viśnu and rudra-
kamalam – Lotus,
bilva daḻam – leaves of stone apple,
japākusumam- red hibiscus can be offered to the Lord.

What kinds of food can be offered to Lord Narasimha?

Athirasa – fried cake made with jaggery and rice flour.
Pāyasa – milk puddings made out of any of moong dal, channa dal, and – – – Pānaka – typically made with jaggery water and pepper, or fruit juice like lemonade.
Any sātvik food can be offered with great devotion by chanting the Narasimha Mantra. sātvik food is that food creates an internal calmness and balance, when one consumes it.

The lord graciously accepts devotees’ service and reverence. All worship should be followed by distribution of Prasāda or food offered to God.

How do we worship Lord Narasimha?

Lord Narasimha can be worshipped in two ways. The first is detailed below:
Along with firm faith, worship of Narasimha is associated with rigid criteria.
This is explained in detail below
1. ācharana ṣuddhi – Requires strict adherence to performance.
2. Cleanliness of ḍravya- physical things like utensils, lamps, ingredients.
3. Inner sanctity of five senses – body, intellect, mind, place, and act of worship
4. Chastity of Mind, speech and deeds unification, compassion, calmness of virtuous soul within. These are to prevent any glitches that might distract the mind while doing the worship.
5. Taking bath and starting with daily routine worship followed by pūja sankalpa-declaration to do worship, and completion without break with little or no food intake till then.
6. Bodily calmness in turn calms the mind. This helps to open up the channel that leads to internal visualization and realization of Narasimha.
These are things that keep body, mind and intellect in balance to further the pursuit of (worship til)attaining perfection.
7. Those who seek Salvation, do fasting till worship is over in the evening.Those who seek all types of desire fulfillment do fasting till the next day morning worship and follow with chanting of Narasimha mantra.
8. To do further, people could do hōma – oblation and read “Nrsimhatāpini ” upaniśad.
9. An idol of Narasimha can be donated to someone who has great respect and potential to worship the idol.

The second means of worship is detailed for those who find it difficult to adhere to the above strict rules, can do the following steps

1. ḍhyāna or meditation – along with imagining the worship of Narasimha with the above said flowers etc.
2. Acts of mind and soul offered to God is also oblation. This is equivalent to hōmam.
3.Various purifying actions performed during puja
a. snānha – ablution, pāna – intake of water and food offered to God
b. pādya – chant with clean and clear heart and intellect
c. arghya – water offered with respect from the river of faith
d. āchamana – water used for sipping same river
e. abhiśeka – for the lord
f. Mind filled with the flow of thoughts of God from the river of faith,
ṣraddha – as the water for cleansing.
4. ātma – Offer sacred soul which is inside the body.
5. bow and perform salutation with state of equanimity
6. ṣaranāgati– self surrender to the Lord

With pure mind and internal contemplation there is no need for external rituals to be performed. Pāramārthika or worship of realizing supreme alone with internal purity surpasses all other forms of worship. That is, true worship with internal purity is more powerful than the external rituals.

As part of worship, singing, listening to discourse is recommended at the end of the worship.

Insight about this incarnation of ṣri mahāviśnu:
The brilliant form of Narasimha is described as comprising of three entities. 1. Brahma from feet to naval, 2. Vishnu–naval to neck 3. Rudra–neck unto head., From there onwards– it is the supreme Godhead, Parabrahma.
Narasimha is personification of truth–perceived and experienced by those who are in the state of union with divine, and that, which is beyond senses – Yoga Samādhi.

The brilliant form of Narasimha is also considered and viewed as an internal phenomenon.

Dear Smt.Meera Raghu,
Thanks for giving us a very comprehensive information on Narasimha Jayanti. Your efforts are always excellent, perfect and highly useful to all in Madhwa community.Rayaru will keep you and your family always happy hale and healthy to continue this sacred service. I just thought of sharing a very sacred stotra on Narasimha which I learnt from somebody (I dont remeber right now.) and chanting this stotra 5 time at any distressful/critical situation will clear the situation with wonderful solution to the problem causing the distress/crisis. I have reproduced this stotra below for the benefit of everyone

Hare Krsna dear Meera Mataji! Dandavat pranaam!
Thank you for the wonderful article but the word “Idol” is completely wrong, it is to be mentioned as “Deity”. The word Idol, which means “an object of false worship”, was introduced by the British to destroy our Vedic Culture.
Thank you 🙂

Arguably Inferior Socket for Paladin PvE Gems for the most part, but Superior for PvP.A side-grade to t6, but an upgrade for almost anything pre-Sunwell.

Comment by mikititan

Anyone knows if this schematic will be buyable from the trainer or will it drop (raid/heroic)? -thanks

Comment by gennym

This item, and all the other engineering helm upgrades, are sunwell trash drops.

So since people need to start farming the instance to begin with and there will be people in the raids who need it you probably won't see this on the AH for quite some time depending on the server.

Comment by mbg98

I wouldn't call this a side grade at all, considering that Sunwell requires paladins to spam Holy Light a lot more than Flash of Light, making their mana regen come mostly from Illumination/holy crit (great for pallies with the 2 piece t6 crit bonus to HL) and being in a group with a Shadow Priest. The upgrades here are where it matters most - a 20 crit increase over t6 (more than 1 % - thats fantastic in a single piece!) and plus 9 healing. Armor? lol - what are you going to do, tank in holy gear in Sunwell? You'll need the stam for the boss fights consdering the dots that Kalecgos does, for starters. Int doesnt matter so much since your mana regen and your +heal are really the major factors in post BT/MH content.

Comment by natto

My server has pug groups for sunwell trush run. BoP/BoE recipes usually drops from 1 to 5 and lots of epic-stones. You do not have to wear BT/Hyjal geared, Kara/SSC/TK gears are fine for trush run.

It usually goes 4k-5k on my server. It is a good resource of money, and you can call ppl when your guild does not have scheduled raid. However, you will need 5-6 mages for trush run.

Comment by Altoid

Dropped for me tonight on Garithos-US on the last pull before the first stairs in the instance.

My guild's been running Sunwell since 2.4 release and the patterns are extremely rare. We've only had 4 patterns drop, ever, and two of them were the Sunfire Robe (both dropped the day before this Schematic).

I was seriously beginning to believe I'd never get my hands on this because of its extreme rarity. I'm reasonably certain it's the only Sunwell Schematic to have dropped on my server as of yet. I've been passing on T6 helms for months in hopes of getting this and was going to give in and pick one up this week, then this baby swooped in!

Comment by alexiel

Can only be learned by Paladins.

Comment by DELMistrzu

Can I learn this Schematic as a Rogue ?

Comment by Entilzha2161

You can only learn this on a pally and it's supposed to only drop for pallies, but it dropped for my DK today (maybe since there were no DKs when Sunwell was released?) My engineer is a druid and cannot use it but I hope some Paladin buys it as the sell price looks pretty high.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Sony Bravia KDL-40HX803 review

Summary

Our Score

8/10

User Score

Review Price £898.95

Sony’s first 3D TV is finally here, in the 40in shape of the KDL-40HX803. And to be honest, we’re not expecting very much. For whenever we’ve seen Sony 3D TVs in action at big shows, they just haven’t looked as good as those of some rivals. So let’s hope the Japanese brand has managed to cram in plenty of last minute improvements!

Rather surprisingly, the 40HX803 doesn’t wear Sony’s new and rather stylish Monolith design. Instead you get a straightforward but sleek black bezel for the top, right and left sides, with a slightly proud metallic strip along the bottom edge. The set still looks nice, though, for all its non-Monolithic approach.

It doesn’t do the 40HX803‘s aesthetic impact any harm, either, that it employs edge LED lighting to deliver a reasonably slender profile. Though it’s nothing like as slim as Samsung’s edge LED icons. What’s more, its edge LED system is a dynamic one, meaning that sections of the edge lighting can be independently controlled for a hopefully more impressive contrast performance than you usually get with a standard edge LED-lit LCD TV.

Slightly surprisingly for such a slim screen, Sony has left most of its connections facing straight out of the TV’s rear, rather than using the side access approach that would suit wall hanging. But at least the number and variety of these connections is pretty prodigious.

For instance, it has four HDMIs, all built to the v1.4 specification, so that they’re compatible with 3D sources. Also of note are a USB input, an Ethernet port, and a 3D Sync terminal, which we’ll look at in turn.

The USB can play music, video and photo files directly into the TV, but also allows you to add Wi-Fi to the 40HX803 via an optional USB dongle. It’s a touch disappointing that the 40HX803 doesn’t carry built-in Wi-Fi for its money, but it’s hardly alone in preferring the optional upgrade route.

The Ethernet socket, meanwhile, has three uses. First, it supports the set’s built-in Freeview HD tuner, to deliver potential future interactive services like the BBC iPlayer. Second, it provides a wired means of importing files stored on a DLNA PC. Finally, it allows you to take the TV online to experience Sony’s Bravia Internet Video platform, which we’ll return to in a minute.

But first we’ve got to discuss the 3D Sync terminal. This is there because the 40HX803 doesn’t have a built-in 3D transmitter, unlike the Samsung and Panasonic 3D TVs we’ve tested. In fact, the 40HX803 doesn’t have 3D facilities at all in its standard form. You have to add an optional extra transmitter and optional pairs of active shutter glasses, with the transmitter costing £50 and the glasses setting you back £99 per pair. This effectively makes the 40HX803 £1,887 if you want 3D with two pairs of glasses.

We do understand Sony’s idea with this, to be fair. For it helps keep the 40HX803’s up-front price down, allowing people to add 3D later as their finances allow. But there’s no getting round the fact that once you’ve 3Ded it up, the 40HX803 hits a similar price level to Samsung’s 40C8000 integrated 3D TV. In other words, 3D continues to be very much a premium technology.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

1. A stock is expected to pay a year-end dividend of $2.00, i.e., D1 = $2.00. The dividend is expected to decline at a rate of 5% a year forever (g = -5%). If the company’s expected and required rate of return is 15%, which of the following statements is CORRECT?

a. The company’s current stock price is $20.

b. The company’s dividend yield 5 years from now is expected to be 10%.

c. The constant growth model cannot be used because the growth rate is negative.

d. The company’s expected capital gains yield is 5%.

e. The company’s stock price next year is expected to be $9.50.

2. A share of common stock has just paid a dividend of $2.00. If the expected long-run growth rate for this stock is 2.0%, and if investors' required rate of return is 10.5%, what is the stock’s intrinsic value?

6. Rentz RVs Inc. (RRV) is presently enjoying relatively high growth because of a surge in the demand for recreational vehicles. Management expects earnings and dividends to grow at a rate of 30% for the next 4 years, after which high gas prices will probably reduce the growth rate in earnings and dividends to zero, i.e., g = 0. The company’s last dividend, D0, was $1.25. RRV’s beta is 1.20, the market risk premium is 5.25%, and the risk-free rate is 3.00%. What is the intrinsic value of RRV’s common stock?

Gates Foundation, Chan Zuckerberg Team Up to Seek 'State of the Art' Ideas for Schools

By Benjamin Herold on
May 8, 2018 1:31 PM

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative are teaming up on a new research-and-development initiative aimed at identifying ""state-of-the-art"" educational strategies and bringing them to the classroom.

The focus is on spurring development of new measures, new ways of teaching, and new technologies for tracking and supporting students' writing ability, math skills, and ""executive functions,"" such as self-control and attention.

In a new Request for Information released today, the groups wrote that researchers from fields as diverse as education, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and technology are generating exciting new ideas about how people actually learn—but that information ""has not yet been translated effectively into methods and tools for teachers and students to use in the classroom every day.""

Such ""research insights must inform ongoing development of tools and instructional approaches that will enable students to overcome math, literacy, and other learning challenges and at scale, in order to reach millions, if not billions, of students,"" the document reads.

The focus of the new efforts is on identifying promising new developments and ideas in three main areas:

Improving students' writing (especially non-fiction).""The skills connected to writing—evaluation of arguments and evidence, critical and creative thinking about solutions and sources, identifying support for a key idea or process, clear and evocative argument-making—are frequently cited as 21st century skills in high demand by employers,"" the Request for Information states. ""Yet, the majority of high school graduates are not prepared for the demands of postsecondary and workplace writing.""

Among the areas where the groups hope to see improvements: comprehensive writing solutions, new metrics for measuring student progress and proficiency in writing, and new tools to promote more collaboration and better feedback.

Improving students' mathematical understanding, application, and related mindsets.Here, the language of the personalized-learning movement (which both organizations support) is clear: There already exist promising approaches that ""help teachers to address individual students' needs by mirroring the same personalized approaches used by the best 1:1 tutors,"" the document states. ""Highly personalized learning experiences and tools have the potential to analyze student responses to understand barriers to student learning, provide immediate feedback, and apply immediate and effective remediation to students when needed.""

Among other things, the organizations are specifically looking for tools that can further personalize math instruction via a focus on the ""whole student""—including children's mindsets, beliefs, attention, and ""affective"" or emotional states.

Measuring and improving students' executive function.""Student success in academics and in future careers is associated with their ability to wrestle with multiple ideas at once, think flexibly, and regulate their action and thoughts,"" the Request for Information states. ""There is much to be done to track and improve students' progress on [executive function] development and connect it to real-world benefits, especially for those who are most at-risk.""

Areas of focus here include advances in techniques for tracking children's development of these skills and abilities, interventions (including ""technology-enhanced programs in or outside of school"") designed to improve desired behaviors, and supports for teachers.

The Gates Foundation is a traditional charitable foundation, chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Over the last decade-plus, the group has dedicated hundreds of millions of dollars a year to such education-related causes as promoting small high schools, changing the way teachers are evaluated, and supporting development of the Common Core State Standards. Last October, the Gates Foundation announced a strategic shift in focus, including a new emphasis on ""locally-driven solutions"" and ""innovative research.""

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, meanwhile, is a newer entity, founded and led by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, pediatrician Priscilla Chan. Structured as a limited-liability corporation, CZI is free to make charitable donations, invest in for-profit companies, and engage in political lobbying and advocacy, with minimal disclosure requirements. The venture-philanthropy group has announced that it will give hundreds of millions of dollars annually to support a vision of ""whole-child personalized learning"" that aims to customize each child's educational experience based on their academic, social, emotional, and physical strengths, needs, and preferences.

Last June, the two groups announced their first substantive collaboration: a $12 million joint award to an intermediary organization known as New Profit, which in turns supports organizations working to promote personalized learning.

In their new Request for Information, the Gates Foundation and CZI said that technology is not the focus of what they hope to spur, but it is expected to play a role.

The groups also emphasized that their new plan is currently in draft stage. Individuals, nonprofit groups, universities, private companies, and government-sponsored labs are invited to respond, with the expectation that those groups' input will in turn shape the foundations' funding plans moving forward.

No decision has yet been made as to how much money the groups will ultimately invest in the new R&D effort.

Why this new partnership, and why now?

""The reason our two philanthropies have decided to join hands in this effort is simple: We believe the scope and importance of this work exceeds what any single organization can or should undertake alone,"" wrote CZI president of education Jim Shelton and Gates Foundation director of K-12 education Bob Hughes in an op-ed published today by Fast Company.

""The purpose of the initiative is not to mandate anything. It's to learn from the work that's currently happening in classrooms, universities, entrepreneurial efforts, and research centers throughout the country.""

Song Story: 'Glory Hallelujah'

Unity is huge. It's not just huge in sports teams and in successful businesses. It's not just huge in committees or even families. Unity is huge to God. It's huge in churches, from the leadership all the way to the last attender and even more it's huge in terms of the Church with a big 'C'... the collective Christ-followers and the churches in which they worship throughout our nation and world. The verses in God's Word that discuss the importance of unity are prolific and the urgency with which the concept is discussed is palpable.

All that said, I wanted to write a worship song that, at it's core, could help unify the congregation singing it. I used 'we' language on this one--something I haven't used a ton in the past--because the lyric and theme begged for it, and I searched for words that could articulate the depth of unity that I believe God desires from us. I think the lyric I'm most proud of in this particular song kicks off the second verse:

All of our brothers and sisters through time have sung of the blood of the same sacrifice

This lyrics speaks to the beautiful truth that singing of His love and sacrifice for us binds believers together in a way that transcends even time. No matter what melody is being sung, no matter what chords are being played by what instruments, believers have been uniting together for centuries singing about the truths of Christ's glorious death and resurrection and all that they imply. To me that's an amazing reality, and one worth giving some serious real estate in our church services!

As for the song-writing fodder I promised... this one was fun to play around with as I wrote it. I used a hemiola passage in the verse (played quietly with a wurlitzer) and bridge (a little more apparent from an electric guitar) with three notes being repeated all the way through large 4/4 phrases. I also truncated all of the phrases in the bridge--all of them 3 bars instead of four--just to add to the urgency of the concept sung there. One of the things I think is most fun, though, about this tune is that the chords in the second verse are quite different than in the first even though the melody is identical... capped off with a 2sus chord replacing the typical 5 in the first verse. Yup... theory geek stuff for sure!

Hope that gives you some insight into the first song on the project! Come back and visit soon as I'll be discussing my first single next time... track #2, entitled 'Here With You.'

Question by Jon: What is the best way to interact with or select job recruiters?
I work primarily as a front end web developer and get calls from multiple recruitment firms. I do a fair bit of project work, so this is a recurring thing for me. Currently, if they have a position that I’m a fit for I reflexively ask them to present me for that position. Is that an optimal strategy? If one company submits me, another cannot, so I want to be submitted by the best company. Should I therefore be taking steps to identify which recruiting firms are the most effective, give preference to local firms, find which firms ask the target employer for a smaller fee, select (somehow) for firms that have a better relationship with the target client, check out a firm’s reputation online before submittal, etc. Or is all of that wasted work?

I’m looking for things that are efficient yet effective. Thanks for any tips!
Yes, I know I can work with several agencies for different jobs. However I CAN’T work with several agencies for the SAME JOB. Not in California, in any case. Double submissions get thrown out, or else the second agency to submit is rejected.

Best answer:

Answer by BillAs a freelancer you can usually work “through” several agencies. This creates competition between them to find you more work. Good Luck",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Medical Designers Save Time, Parts With Software

HIGH STRESS: The sensor in Tensys’ new blood-pressure
monitor floats within a rigid frame attached to a serpentine arm designed
to flex. Engineers used SolidWorks and COSMOSWORKS to design the arm and
see how it would perform under real-world flexing, saving prototypes.

“Faster, cheaper, better” is a phrase that may have its genesis in the
aerospace industry, but it has launched breakthrough designs in other industries
as well. Case in point: the medical industry, where device manufacturers have
used CAD and FEA to give flight to new design ideas while slashing
product-development time.

Two recent examples, one in the U.S. and one in the U.K., show the improvements and time/cost savings engineers have realized from their use of engineering software.

In Camberly, U.K., the design team at reseller Williams Medical Supplies set up a new technical development department to design medical products and settled on Solid Edge (UGS) as its core design tool. “Our aim is to take a routine surgical instrument and bring something new to the design that will provide significant benefit,” says Robert Steele, technical development director. Among their projects: the Opmaster Series 4 surgery operating table. The enhanced design allows a patient to be examined, operated on, and recover on the same table.

Using Solid Edge, the team modeled parts and ran collision and interference analyses and motion simulation. “We were able to sit with sales and marketing during the initial design stage and get feedback,” says Steele. “Engineers don’t always get it right, but with the software we could rehearse the design and minimize the risk of getting it wrong.”

The result was a major time savings, largely the result of not doing many prototypes. “In fact, we were almost able to dispense with the prototyping phase and go straight to manufacturing,” Steele asserts.

Working with different software and on a vastly different product line, engineers at San Diego-based Tensys Medical, Inc. had similar results.

Using SolidWorks for CAD and COSMOSWorks for FEA (both from Dassault Systemes, Inc.) the engineering team developed the T-Line[R] Tensymeter, a non-invasive arterial blood-pressure management system for use in surgery. Their goal was to replace the traditional cuff-based monitors that provide only intermittent measurements every few minutes. That kind of irregular monitoring can delay recognition of rapid changes in blood pressure.

The design concept uses an actuator to move a sensor over the patient’s wrist to find the best position for producing a continuous waveform. “The sensor has to float within a rigid frame attached to a serpentine arm that’s designed to flex. The team used COSMOSWORKS to identify areas of high stress for the olefin-based serpentine arm and used the analysis results to make design modifications.

Among those modifications, says Senior Engineer Russ Hempstead: “We removed the stress risers, added radii, and added thickening sections.” He and the engineering team didn’t expect to see the stress risers, but when they did they put static flexing on part of the serpentine arm so they could move it the way it would move in the real world. The software enabled the team to shorten the design cycle by 60 percent. They cut manufacturing time by four percent, material costs by three percent, and labor costs by three-four percent. In all, engineers did seven or eight analysis studies in just a couple of days.

Hempstead says the team cut the number of parts by putting as much functionality in a part as possible. It’s a strategy he recommends to others. “It may complicate tooling, but it still eases manufacturing,” he says. “We got rid of four components.”

Industrial workplaces are governed by OSHA rules, but this isn’t to say that rules are always followed. While injuries happen on production floors for a variety of reasons, of the top 10 OSHA rules that are most often ignored in industrial settings, two directly involve machine design: lockout/tagout procedures (LO/TO) and machine guarding.

"I listened to this one, narrated by Justine Eyre. It was about 12 hours long, but it passed by quickly with this fun read. It's not particularly deep or magical and it doesn't call life as we know it into question.

It's a nice read/listen, light and intriguing for anyone in the mood for a little escape from the disappointments that have been abounding.

Funny enough, the only problems with the book are also reasons why I liked it. Lily Kaiser's journey is a little too convenient throughout the book but that can be just perfect sometimes. It can be exactly what I need to read or listen in order to balance out the pressure of the world.

So, yes, the book is a little too neat. The story a little too beautiful and coincidental and works a little too well, but I didn't mind it at all. Mostly because it was also written incredibly well. It moves between times, giving insight into Rose Gallway's life that Lily doesn't readily have and let's the reader piece some of it together on our own. I do enjoy that. And then the author lays it all out and it's just perfect. A little too perfect, like in one of those rom-coms that we watch to feel good but that we all know aren't the way the world works.

I really loved that about it. It's going to be one of my comfort books, to peruse when I'm down, maybe listen to when I wanna revel in new beginnings, like the mood I re-watch Stardust in. If you've read a few too many mysteries lately, or too many books that ripped your heart out (like I have recently), than this is the perfect book to recover with. It's comforting and sweet and romantic and doesn't take itself too seriously. But it's not the book for that serious deep read. Don't expect it to be.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"My new global trends book is out now: The Future of Almost Everything. But it takes at least 20 years to evaluate how good a trends analyst was / is – so what about forecasts made by me in previous books, about what to expect over the following decade or two or three? How did those forecasts measure up? I had to answer that question for myself by re-reading what I wrote in the past about the future, before writing my latest book. Read FREE SAMPLE of The Truth about Almost Everything.

So you can judge for yourself, here are loads of predictions I made in the past - and the book in which they were made plus date. Every one of these is already a reality or looks like it soon could be, as of August 2015....And yes I got some things wrong - not many fortunately. I am going to publish the entire text of Futurewise 1998 edition on this website for a complete picture - but of course on this site already are hundreds of posts and videos going back in some cases over 20 years.

Here's one I got wrong: I thought video streaming would take off - but with more use of live video using smartphones that we have actually seen. Most personal video streaming is of course things like YouTube clips.

Most forecasting errors in my experience are not over WHAT is going to happen as the trend is usually fairly obvious, but by WHEN with questions about real impact. So here goes: how did I see the future of banking, global economy, mobile, smartphones, Internet of Things, Big Data and so on...?

Banking

Banking as it is in 1998 will never survive and will fall in profitability. 1998 - Futurewise

Internet of Things and Smart Homes

All new homes in developed nations will be intelligent by 2010, Smart homes will boast 15-20% energy savings. 1998 - Futurewise

Every device with a power socket will be online. Washing machine will call engineer. Garage doors will open automatically, alarm will be turned off, lights will go on, coffee machine will begin to pour a coffee and so on. 1998 - Futurewise

Power generation in many homes from solar cells and wind in rural areas 1998 – Futurewise

Retail and e-commerce

Basic shopping will be done online and the rest will become a recreational activity – so shopping centres will have to learn from theme parks to reinvent themselves as a leisure experience. 1998 - Futurewise

Loss of millions of small retailers by 2005 as huge chains expand market share, These global chains will increase own brand sales from 15% to 30% by 2010. However many corner shops will survive because of convenience, parking restrictions and so on. We will see a big reversal of the trend to build more out of town superstores, with rapid growth of smaller outlets of the same chains. 1998 - Futurewise

Millions of people will buy and sell from each other directly at cut throat prices for new and second-hand goods, by posting information online, with instant matching of buyers and sellers, creating virtual “street markets”. 1998 – Futurewise

Europe and global economy

Major economic disruptions will occur affecting many nations from a series of very low probability but very high impact events, with combined impact. 1998 - Futurewise

Expect increasingly complicated financial instruments to be developed, which will add to risks of economic instability. 1998 – Futurewise

"Sandusky Sent Down River

After a Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Corrections Department review, convicted child molester and former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky has been sent to the Greene State Prison, where he will serve out his sentence (and probably, his life) in protective custody. He’s still pursuing appeals, which no one expects to go anywhere.

Greene is a maximum security prison, classified as a “Supermax“, which contains a Death Row. Lifers there include Philadelphia serial killer Juan Covington, and three convicts await execution. This is one tough place.

“We make individual decisions based on facts,” Corrections Secretary John Wetzel said in a written statement. “Given the high-profile nature of this individual, coupled with the nature of his crimes, this makes him very vulnerable in a prison setting.”

Noooo kidding, John!

(We all know from watching TV crime dramas what happens to guys like Jer in da Big House.)

Just how effective will the security measures be? Better be Biohazard Level 5 containment for Ol’ Jer.

He will not have a cellmate and will be subjected to heightened supervision and an escort when not in his cell. He will get an hour of individual exercise five days a week and three showers a week — alone, save for the escort. He will eat meals in his cell. All other services, including religion, medications, and treatment programming will be conducted in his cell.

All visits will be non-contact. No touching of or by the Tickle Monster.

Sandusky’s legal representations did not return phone calls.

This is close to home for “Jer”. His home town of “Little Washington” is a half-hour north on I-79. A further half-hour north lies the thriving, post-ferrous metropolis of Pittsburgh.

The State Correctional Institution at Greene, as it is formally known, is a maximum-security prison that houses a total of 1,800 inmates and employs 700 people.

"Araucaria clonal forestry: types of cuttings and mother tree sex in field survival and growth

Resumo:

Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O Kuntze (Paraná pine or Araucaria) is a potential forestry native species for Brazilian silviculture. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints persist, hindering its silvicultural expansion, among which are the lack of cloning technologies of superior genetic materials and their assessment under field conditions. Thus, we evaluated the potential use of araucaria plants derived from cuttings and seeds for timber production, by assessing field survival, growth and strobilus production using cuttings from male and female plants, collected from different positions, compared with those produced by sexual reproduction. Clones of male and female trees from different types of cuttings and seedlings were planted in 3 x 3 m spacing. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design of one tree plot with three treatments. Female clones and apical cuttings showed higher growth in diameter at breast height (6.4 cm) and total height (3.6 m) 74 months after planting, followed by seedlings and other clones, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings technique is potential for araucaria propagation for wood production purposes, and it is favored by the use of apical cuttings from female mother trees.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Hey Everyone,
This is my first post on the board, and I'm glad to see there is a section specifically on Spanish wines as they've always been a favorite of mine!
I recently drank the wine mentioned in the tile and absoultely loved it. The only problem is that I bought it in Sevilla, and haven't been able to find the exact wine at the local wine superstores. Any advice on how to find if this wine is imported and how to get it.

Welcome to the board, MrB. A Website we commonly use when looking for an elusive bottle is wine-searcher.com, but unfortunately it turned up a no-find. Also checked my regional benchmark, Spec's in Houston, with the same result. You may need to settle for a reasonable sub.

Despite all you see in the stores, both Spain and Italy (the largest wine producers in the world) only export a relatively small number of wines to the U.S. or anyone else. Find something you like in Chi-town and enjoy.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"I admit I never thought I’d do any analytical work on Resident Evil 4. Don’t get me wrong; it’s one of my favorite games. Being extremely fun to play, and a having a wonderfully creepy aesthetic are just a few of the game’s strengths. But it’s a silly game in a lot of ways. There aren’t larger messages and meanings to glean from it. And at some moments, the game mechanics and the overall story don’t match up very well. I’d like to discuss one of those moments: Luis’s famous death in castle. I’ll use this example to discuss the elements of motivation and capacity in video games.

You may recall from my previous article a discussion of a player’s motivation and capacity while playing a video game. Although I mentioned these terms, I never adequately defined them, so I’ll do so now. A player’s motivation is the reason he or she cares about playing the game and effecting some kind of difference in the world and story in which he or she is immersed. This element is present in other mediums—it’s the reason we continue to read/watch the story. A player’s capacity, unlike motivation, is intrinsically tied to game mechanics; it consists of the things that the player is able to do in the game world. The analogue of capacity in other media is simply the reader’s ability to continue to watch or read the story. There are further complexities in games, however, including that a player’s degree of capacity can effect his or her motivation, but that is a discussion for another time (probably focusing on Deus Ex). For now, recall my claim that in order for a game to be truly impactful, both of these elements must exist (or noticeably not exist, as I’ll discuss in my next article). Note also that the capacity element is harder and more important to make present, since it’s the element that video games have introduced to storytelling.

So let’s see whether both motivation and capacity exist in the case of Luis’s death. For those who haven’t played the game, you can watch a video of the moment below.

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsfebZKsp94&w=420&h=315]

I’ll summarize the scene: Luis was attempting to help you get a “sample” of great value from the game’s primary villain, Saddler. But Saddler kills Luis, taking back the sample (classic). As Luis lies dying before you, he gives you a temporary antidote to the parasite that you are infected with, and tells you to stop Saddler. When he finally passes away, Leon yells out him name in anguish.

So this moment most certainly provides the player with motivation. And there are multiple reasons for this. In his final moments, Luis literally gives the player the primary plot incentive for the remainder of the game: stop Saddler and get the sample back. On top of that, finding out that Leon isn’t doomed to die at the hands of his parasite energies the player with a new sense of hope. But, most importantly, the player’s motivation is an extension of Leon’s grief. If the player empathizes with Leon (hopefully they do if they’ve gotten this far in the game), when Leon cries out in agony over the death of his friend, the player, too, is motivated seek justice for a lost friend. This is the opposite of Link’s silence that I discussed in my last article. Unlike Link, who leaves you to form your experience for yourself, Leon hands you his grief, and in this way motivates you to action. This is good storytelling. Clearly Resident Evil 4 has nailed the motivational aspect of making a powerful narrative in a game. But at this point there’s no particular reason story-wise to play the game instead of just watching it.

So let’s think about capacity. Capacity is the additional element that makes a video game unique as opposed to movies or books. And the extent of what video games can do with capacity hasn’t been fully explored. So, even though it’s not necessary for a game to use dynamics of capacity in order to tell a good story, ignoring this element is missing an opportunity for better storytelling. Since capacity is unique to games, if there’s no interesting storytelling or fun mechanics, there’s no reason to play the game instead of just watch it.

Now, in order to discuss capacity in the case of death, capacity takes on a slight nuance. When a character dies in a game, the key aspect of capacity is actually the change in capacity. It doesn’t matter so much what the capacity level is in general, it just matters if there is a difference before and after a character’s death. This provides meaning for the death within the structure of the game mechanics. For example, if a character dies in a game but is immediately replaced by an almost identical analogue, their death has little visceral impact for the player, who can’t feel the impact of the character’s death on the gameplay. This actually does happen: in Legend of The Dragoon, when one of your party members, Lavitz, dies, Albert, who literally takes on the stats of Lavitz, almost immediately replaces him. Even more notably, Cait Sith dies in Final Fantasy VII, but is quite literally replaced by an entirely identical avatar called “Cait Sith 2”. In these situations the player’s capacity has not changed, and thus the deaths have lost some of their potential narrative impact.

That’s kind of what it feels like when Luis dies in Resident Evil 4. Although he helps you out as a non-player character (NPC) at various points in the game, it’s not as though he’s the only character who does this. And there’s nothing to distinguish him mechanics-wise from the other characters you meet and team up with. What’s more, you continue to have access to other NPCs you can get help from after he dies. So, in terms of how it feels to play the game, you don’t even notice he’s gone. As far as the player’s capacity to team up with others in order to stay alive, very little changes after Luis’s death. The player’s capacity thus changes very little when he dies, and though the player grieves with Leon, it’s difficult to feel a real sense of loss.

To sum up, although the story of Luis’s death in Resident Evil is well told in terms of movies and books, the developers missed the opportunity to tell this story through the game mechanics in terms of a change in player capacity. Luis was not a unique character mechanically, and other characters that Leon meets effectively replace his avatar. The death is meaningful to watch, but far less meaningful to play.

Beekeeping can be a full-time profession or a hobby that is simple. Nonetheless, more often than not, what started as a hobby would turn into a profession. But you cannot simply tell and decide yourself you will start to do beekeeping. Before starting on any avocation or profession, you need to have understanding and satisfactory knowledge on the subject that you are going to enter. If you’ve been putting off your interest in beekeeping for quite a while, then it’s about time to indulge yourself in your line of interest. Bee farming may seem simple; learning the basic beekeeping lessons can enable you to get away to a good start.

What does a beekeeper need to understand?

On beekeeping to start at the right foot you should have interest that is complete. You need to spend time taking care of your colonies of bees. You should have also agreed to share your home space with the bees. There are potential risks in beekeeping that can harm not only you but your family also. Your focus is not only to make money by selling honey; a good beekeeper should have passion and a keen interest in rearing bees.

An apiarist should know the right place for the beehives. You have to make sure beekeeping is allowed in your area, if you decide to place your beehives at your backyard. There are several places restricted to beekeeping; you have to get permission concerning this.

Beekeepers must know whether beekeeping supplies are available in the area where the beehives are situated. When you must go to a neighborhood beekeeping shop you may never understand; it is best that a nearby beekeeping store is reachable.

Equipment and protective tools are also very important to beekeepers to know. Know the right kind of suit to choose to keep you from any possible danger in beekeeping.

If you’re incapable to harvest honey from your bees all the efforts that are beekeeping would be futile. A beekeeper should know the methods in gathering the honey from the comb; beeswax is also part of the returns in beekeeping.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

So the Oscar nominations were announced this morning, and, as expected, the great British hope, Atonement, was nominated for Best Picture. However, its two stars, James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, were omitted for the top acting …

The British dominance of Hollywood has been a big story throughout award season. But one could be forgiven for mistaking last night’s Oscars for a World Cup match, and, predictably, Britain got beaten by Mexico.

"Recently, I sat down to talk with a group of eight students from a large prominent church in Southern California. They were raised in the church. They were regulars at youth group. They claimed to be in relationship with Christ. Yet, they were dead. As I tried to engage them, most seemed unmoved and uninterested. And I was not surprised.

As I work with churches around the country, I encounter countless Christian students who are apathetic toward spiritual things. Their relationship with Christ is passionless. Talk of God is ho-hum. But why? Shouldn’t our relationship with Christ be life’s most exciting adventure? I’m not suggesting the Christian life is one, big, emotional high, but why are students more willing to plug into their iPods than their Bibles? Why are they more excited about the latest celebrity gossip than the Gospel? Why aren’t their lives filled with the drama of God’s Kingdom?

I think a big part of the problem is that Christian students rarely engage their world for the cause of Christ. Here’s what I’ve observed in my training over the years. The most exciting events I do, the events where students seem to come to life, are those where there is some component of engagement. Let me illustrate.

For almost ten years now, I’ve been taking students on mission trips to Berkeley and Utah. Each trip requires hours of training, typically in the form of classroom instruction and the reading of required books. This training is important and necessary, but it’s not what generates the most buzz among the students. Students get fired up on the trip when we give them opportunities to engage non-believers.

On these trips we invite Mormon leaders, Unitarians, gay activists, Hare Krishna priests, skeptics, and atheists to dialogue with students. We give our non-Christian guests time to share their views, followed by a time of questions from our students. It’s during Q&A when students really come to life. They ask question after question, graciously yet firmly force our skeptical guests to give a reason for their views. At the conclusion of each encounter, we thank our guests and then spend time debriefing. At this point, students are always abuzz, asking me question after question. Before I know it, an hour of discussing apologetics and theology with youth will have flown by.

In addition, we send our groups onto college campuses, like BYU or Berkeley, to conduct surveys. The surveys are designed to get our students into conversation with non-Christians students about spiritual issues. At first, students are fearful and anxious. They’re skeptical about people’s willingness to engage with them. But after an hour or two of surveys, students return and they are always pumped. During our debrief time, students can’t wait to share about their encounters. They’re filled with excitement about their conversations on campus with non-Christians.

When we create opportunities for students to engage, there is a vibrancy that infuses the events. But this shouldn’t come as a surprise. Christianity is not a spectator sport. Our teaching should not remain in a classroom or behind the four walls of the church. If we want to train students who can defend the faith not just intelligently but passionately, we need to get them in the game. Think about any sports teams. It’s the starters who are the most passionate about the game, right? The benchwarmers, not so much. I think that’s one reason why our mission trips to Berkeley and Utah are exciting and successful. They get students in the game. They get students engaging a lost world with the truth of Jesus Christ.

In 2014, students will get a taste of being in the game as I take them to Berkeley and Utah. I’ve already maxed out the number of mission trips I’m capable of taking through July. Indeed, we’ve had to turn groups away or ask them to start scheduling for 2015. So this year, we’ll be getting students off the sidelines and igniting their fire for Christ. I can’t wait.

"Abstract

The entorhinal cortex receives a large projection from the piriform cortex, and synaptic plasticity in this pathway may affect olfactory processing. In vitro whole cell recordings have been used here to investigate postsynaptic signalling mechanisms that mediate the induction of long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in layer II entorhinal cortex cells. To induce LTD, pairs of pulses, using a 30-millisecond interval, were delivered at 1 Hz for 15 minutes. Induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist APV and by the calcium chelator BAPTA, consistent with a requirement for calcium influx via NMDA receptors. Induction of LTD was blocked when the FK506 was included in the intracellular solution to block the phosphatase calcineurin. Okadaic acid, which blocks activation of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, also prevented LTD. Activation of protein phosphatases following calcium influx therefore contributes to induction of LTD in layer II of the entorhinal cortex.

1. Introduction

The mechanisms that mediate the
induction of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) [1, 2] and depression (LTD) [3–5]
have been studied intensively within the hippocampus, but less is known about the
signalling mechanisms for LTP and LTD in the entorhinal cortex. Because the
entorhinal cortex receives highly processed inputs from sensory and association
cortices and also provides the hippocampal region with much of its sensory
input [6, 7], lasting changes in the strength of synaptic inputs to the entorhinal
cortex could alter the manner in which multimodal cortical inputs are
integrated, modulate the strength of transmission of specific patterns of sensory
input within the hippocampal formation, and contribute to mnemonic function [8–11]. Determining the effective stimulation
parameters and the intracellular signals that mediate synaptic plasticity in
the entorhinal cortex should allow insight into basic mechanisms that contribute
to the cognitive functions of the parahippocampal region.

Long-term potentiation of cortical inputs to
the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex has been described in vivo [11–14] and in vitro [15, 16]. Stimulation
patterns required to induce LTP tend to be more intense in the entorhinal
cortex than in the hippocampus [12, 14], and we have also found that induction
of LTD in the entorhinal cortex requires intense low-frequency stimulation [17, 18]. In the hippocampus, conventional
1 Hz stimulation trains have been most
effective in slices taken from juvenile animals [19, 20] but are generally
ineffective in adult slices [21–23] and in intact animals ([31, 32], see also [33]).
Similarly, 1 Hz stimulation induces entorhinal LTD in slices from young animals
[28, 29] but is not effective in vivo [17] or in slices from older animals [18].
Repeated stimulation using pairs of pulses separated by a short 25- to 50-millisecond
interval can induce LTD more effectively in both the CA1 ([24–26], but see [27]) and
entorhinal cortex [17, 18, 33, 34]. In the CA1, the LTD induced by this stimulation
pattern is NMDA receptor-dependent, but it also depends upon activation of
local inhibitory mechanisms by the pulse-pairs [30, 31]. In the entorhinal cortex, however, repeated
paired-pulse stimulation using a 10-millisecond interval that evokes maximal paired-pulse
inhibition does not induce LTD, and LTD is induced when a 30-millisecond
interval is used that evokes maximal paired-pulse facilitation [17]. The LTD can also be enhanced when GABAA transmission is reduced with bicuculline [18]. This further suggests that LTD
in the entorhinal cortex does not require activation of local inhibitory
mechanisms but rather requires prolonged stimulation patterns that are strong
enough to overcome local inhibition and lead to NMDA receptor activation. Strong
local inhibition in the entorhinal cortex [8, 35] may thus place a restraint on
activity-dependent synaptic modification. Consistent with this idea is the
finding that the same pairing stimulation protocol that induces LTP in
hippocampus leads to LTD in entorhinal cortex [28].

Signalling mechanisms that mediate LTD in the
superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex share some similarities with NMDA
receptor-dependent LTD in the hippocampus. Long-term depression of superficial
layer inputs to layer II is dependent on NMDA receptor activation both in vivo
and in vitro [17, 18, 28, 33] but does not require activation of group I/II
metabotropic glutamate receptors ([18, 28], see [36, 37]). In the hippocampus, moderate
and prolonged influx of calcium via NMDA receptors activates calmodulin which leads
to LTD via activation of the protein phosphatase calcineurin (PP2b). Calcineurin
increases the activity of protein phosphatase 1 by reducing the activity of
inhibitor 1, and this can cause rapid reductions in AMPA-mediated responses [2, 38, 39]. Hippocampal LTD is expressed partly through the reduced conductance of
AMPA receptors caused by dephosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit by PP1 [2, 4], but
careful study has shown that calcineurin-dependent LTD in deep layer inputs to
layer II neurons in the young entorhinal cortex is not associated with a
reduced AMPA conductance, but rather involves internalization of AMPA receptors
and their proteosome-mediated degradation [28].

In the present study, the early postsynaptic
signalling mechanisms that mediate LTD in layer I inputs to layer II neurons of
the medial entorhinal cortex have been investigated using recordings of whole
cell excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Long-term depression was induced using
a prolonged paired-pulse stimulation pattern that was previously found to be
effective for induction of NMDA-receptor-dependent LTD [18]. Pharmacological agents applied to the
bathing medium or intracellular solution were used to assess the dependence of
LTD on calcium-dependent signalling mechanisms including the phosphatases calcineurin
and PP1/PP2a.

2. Experimental Procedures

2.1. Slices and Whole Cell Recordings

Experiments were performed on slices from male
Long-Evans rats (4 to 8 weeks old). Animals were anesthetized with halothane and brains were rapidly removed
and cooled (4°C) in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). ACSF
consisted of (in mM) 124 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2
MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 dextrose and
was saturated with 95% O2–5% CO2. All chemicals were obtained
from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo, USA) unless otherwise indicated. Horizontal slices (300𝜇m) were cut with a
vibratome (WPI, Vibroslice
NVSL, Sarasota, Fla, USA) and were allowed to recover for at least one hour before
recordings. Slices were maintained in a recording chamber with oxygenated ACSF
at a rate of 2.0 mL/min, and a temperature from 22 to 24°C was used to
minimize metabolic demands on slices [18, 28]. Neurons were viewed with an
upright microscope (Leica
DML-FS, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a 40x objective, differential interference
contrast optics, and an infrared video camera (Cohu, 4990 series, San Diego, Calif, USA).

2.2. LTD Induction and Pharmacology

Whole-cell current clamp recordings of EPSPs
were monitored 10 minutes before and 30 minutes after LTD induction by
delivering test-pulses every 20 seconds. Intensity was adjusted to evoke EPSPs
that were approximately 3 to 4 mV in amplitude, and cells were held 5 mV below
threshold when necessary to prevent the occurrence of spikes in response to
EPSPs. Stimulus parameters for LTD
induction were based on those used previously in vivo and in vitro
[17, 18]. The induction of LTD was tested using pairs of stimulation pulses (30-millisecond
interpulse interval) delivered at a frequency of 1 Hz for either 7.5 or 15 minutes
[18]. Control cells received test-pulses throughout the recording period and
did not receive conditioning stimulation.

Signalling mechanisms mediating the induction
of LTD were tested using stock solutions of pharmacological agents that were
stored frozen and diluted on the day of use. NMDA glutamate receptors were
blocked by constant bath application of 50𝜇M DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate
(APV). The calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic
acid (BAPTA, 10 mM) was included in the recording electrode solution to block
increases in intracellular calcium. To block activation of the
calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin (PP2b) slices were pre-exposed
to 250𝜇M cyclosporin A (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., North York, Ontario, Canada) for 1.5 to 3 hours [39]. In other
experiments, FK506 (50𝜇M) was included in the recording electrode solution to
block calcineurin [39, 40]. In other experiments, okadaic acid (0.1 or 1.0𝜇M)
was included in the recording solution to block activation of protein phosphatases
1 and 2a [40, 41]. Control recordings without paired-pulse stimulation were
used to verify the stability of recordings in cells filled with FK506 and 1.0𝜇M
okadaic acid.

2.3. Data Analysis

Synaptic
responses and electrophysiological properties of layer II neurons were analyzed
using the program Clampfit 8.2 (Axon Instr.). Data were standardized to the mean of baseline responses for plotting
and were expressed as the mean ±SEM. Changes in EPSP amplitude were assessed
using mixed-design ANOVAs and Neuman-Keuls tests that compared the average responses
during the baseline period, 5 minutes after conditioning stimulation, and during
the last 5 minutes of the recording period.

Layer II neurons
were classified as putative stellate
or nonstellate neurons based on electrophysiological characteristics described
by Alonso and Klink [42]. Stellate neurons were characterized by the presence
of low-frequency subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, a depolarizing
afterpotential following spikes, and prominent inward rectification in response
to hyperpolarizing current pulses. Both
pyramidal and stellate neurons in layer II can show inward rectifying sag
responses [43]. Here, neurons recorded were clearly in layer II, usually near
the border with layer I, and a proportion of these neurons did not show clear
sag and were classified as pyramidal neurons. Input resistance was
determined from the peak voltage response to −100 pA current pulses (500-millisecond
duration), and rectification ratio was quantified by expressing peak input
resistance as a proportion of the steady-state resistance at the end of the current
pulse.

3. Results

Stable recordings were obtained from 57 putative
stellate neurons and 21 putative nonstellate cells. Peak input resistance was
similar in stellate and pyramidal neurons (stellate, 95 ± 6 MΩ; pyramidal, 96
± 10 MΩ) but there was a much larger sag in voltage responses to hyperpolarizing
current injection in stellate cells (rectification ratio 1.37±0.04 in stellate
cells versus 1.06±0.01 in pyramidal cells). The amplitude of baseline synaptic
responses evoked by layer I stimulation was similar in stellate (3.9±0.2 mV)
and pyramidal cells (3.7±0.4 mV), and the amount of depression induced was
also similar for recording conditions in which significant LTD was obtained (71.2±5.6% in 14 stellate and 76.8±7.6% in 6 pyramidal cells).

3.1. LTD Induction

To determine if a relatively brief LTD
induction protocol could be used to induce LTD in whole-cell recordings, the
first tests attempted to induce LTD using paired-pulse delivery at 1 Hz for 7.5
minutes (𝑛=10) which can induce
moderate LTD of field potentials in a gas-fluid interface recording chamber [18].
Paired-pulse stimulation for 7.5 minutes did not induce depression of EPSPs
relative to control cells (93.0±10.0% of baseline after 30 minutes; F2,28=0.09,𝑃=.92). We previously observed stronger LTD of field potentials in the
interface recording chamber after 15 minutes versus 7.5 minutes of paired-pulse
stimulation [18], and prolonged
paired-pulse stimulation for 15 minutes also reliably induced LTD of whole-cell
EPSPs (𝑛=7, Figure 1). EPSP amplitude was reduced to 56.3±9.5% of
baseline levels 5 minutes after the conditioning stimulation, and remained at
58.6±6.1% of baseline levels at the end of the 30 minutes follow-up
period (F2,22=14.2,𝑃<.001).
Responses in control cells were stable (𝑛=6),
and remained at 99.6±2.6% of baseline levels at the end of the recording period (Figures 1(b2), 1(c)).

depression was induced by repetitive delivery of pairs of stimulation pulses at a rate of 1 Hz for 15 minutes (PP-LFS). The amplitude

stimulation. Traces in (b) compare responses

neuron that received low-frequency stimulation (b1) and in a control cell (b2). Responses were obtained at the times indicated in (c).
Averaged points in (b) indicate the mean ±1 SEM in this
and subsequent figures. (d) Long-term depression was not
reliably induced when low-frequency stimulation was delivered for only 7.5 minutes
rather than 15 minutes, indicating that induction of LTD requires prolonged
stimulation.

3.2. NMDA Receptors and Postsynaptic Calcium

The NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocks
induction of LTD in the entorhinal cortex in vivo [17] and the NMDA receptor blocker APV has been shown to prevent LTD
of field potentials and EPSPs in entorhinal cortex slices [18, 28, 33]. We therefore tested for
the NMDA receptor-dependence of LTD of EPSPs in the current preparation using
constant bath application of APV (50𝜇M). Induction of LTD by 15 minutes of
paired-pulse stimulation was blocked by APV (𝑛=6, Figure 2(a)). There was a tendency for responses to be
potentiated immediately following conditioning stimulation, but this variable effect
was not statistically significant, and responses were close to baseline levels
at the end of the recording period (96.7±13.2% of baseline;
F2,10=2.99,𝑃=.09).

Figure 2: The induction of long-term
depression is dependent on activation of NMDA glutamate receptors and on
increases in postsynaptic calcium. (a) Constant bath application of the
NMDA receptor antagonist APV (50𝜇M) blocked the induction of long-term
depression by 15 minutes of paired-pulse low-frequency stimulation (PP LFS). (b) Blocking increases in
postsynaptic calcium by including the calcium chelator BAPTA (10 mM) in the recording
electrode solution also blocked the induction of LTD. The transient facilitation of EPSPs immediately
following stimulation was significant for the BAPTA condition but not the APV
condition, and responses were at baseline levels at the end of the recording
periods. The block of lasting depression suggests that calcium influx via NMDA
receptors is required for induction of LTD.

The role of postsynaptic calcium in LTD
induction was tested by recording from cells in which the calcium chelator
BAPTA (10 mM) was included in the recording electrode solution (10 mM, 𝑛=6, Figure 2(b)). Cells filled with
BAPTA had longer-duration action potentials than control cells (6.1±0.7 versus
3.3±0.1 milliseconds measured at the base; 𝑡1,9=3,57,𝑃<.01) consistent with a reduction in
calcium-dependent potassium conductances. The induction of LTD was blocked in
cells loaded with BAPTA. There was a significant increase in the amplitude of
EPSPs immediately following paired-pulse stimulation (to 122.3±6.0% of baseline; F2,10=5.46,𝑃<.05; N–K, 𝑃<.05), but responses returned to
baseline levels within 10 minutes and were at 94.8±7.1% of baseline levels
after 30 minutes (N–K, 𝑃=0.50, Figure
2(b)). An increase in postsynaptic calcium is therefore required for induction
of LTD in layer II neurons of the entorhinal cortex.

3.3. Protein Phosphatases

The role of the calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase
calcineurin (PP2b) in LTD in layer II neurons was tested using either
pre-exposure to 250𝜇M cyclosporin A in the bathing medium [39], or by
including 50𝜇M FK506 postsynaptically in the recording electrode solution. In cells pre-exposed to cyclosporin A, paired-pulse stimulation was followed by a depression in EPSP amplitude that
reached
82.4±7.5% of baseline levels after 30 minutes (Figure 3(a)).
Although the depression in the cyclosporin group was not statistically
significant (F2,10=3.51,𝑃=0.07,𝑛=6), the depression obtained was also not significantly less than that
observed in control ACSF (F1,11=3.79,𝑃=.08). The result was therefore ambiguous with respect to the role
of calcineurin in LTD. To test the involvement of calcineurin more definitively
and to avoid potential presynaptic effects, the calcineurin blocker FK506 was
included in the recording electrode solution for additional groups of cells [40].
Responses in cells filled with FK506 showed a significant potentiation
immediately following paired-pulse stimulation (𝑛=8), but there was no lasting
change in response amplitudes in comparison to control cells filled with FK506
that did not receive conditioning stimulation (𝑛=7). Responses were increased
to 134.9±10.5% of baseline levels immediately following paired-pulse
stimulation, (F2,26=7.71,𝑃<.01; N–K, 𝑃<.001;𝑛=8) but returned to 102.2±6.1% of baseline levels after 30 minutes (Figure 3(b)).

Figure 3: Long-term depression is dependent
on activation of the calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin.
Although LTD was only partially inhibited by pre-exposure to cyclosporin A, it
was completely blocked when FK506 was included in the recording electrode
solution. (a) Pre-exposure of slices to the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin
A (250𝜇M) for 1.5 to 3 hours resulted in a partial block of LTD by repeated
paired-pulse stimulation. The amount of LTD induced was smaller than in control
ACSF and was close to statistical significance (𝑛=6,𝑃=.07). (b) Including the FK506 in the recording electrode solution to directly block
postsynaptic calcineurin prevented the induction of LTD. Analysis of group responses showed a
significant increase in responses during the baseline period, but responses in
control cells indicate that this increase is transient and unlikely to have
affected measurement of LTD. Inhibition of postsynaptic calcineurin therefore
prevents induction of LTD in layer II cells of the entorhinal cortex.

Inspection of averaged responses suggested that
there was an initial increase in responses during the baseline period among
cells filled with FK506, and comparison of responses recorded during the first
and last minutes of the baseline period showed that the increase was
significant (𝑡14=3.09,𝑃<.01).
Interestingly, then, interfering with calcineurin function can lead to enhanced
basal synaptic transmission in entorhinal neurons. This increase is not likely
to have affected measures of LTD in conditioned cells, however, because control
responses showed only a transient increase after which responses remained stable.

Protein phosphatase 1 is thought to contribute directly
to suppression of hippocampal EPSPs during LTD by dephosphorylation of the GluR1
AMPA receptor subunit. The involvement of PP1 to LTD in the entorhinal cortex
was therefore tested by including okadaic acid in the recording electrode
solution. In early experiments, a low concentration of 0.1𝜇M okadaic acid [41] did not block LTD
induction, and responses were depressed to 72.7±8.7% of baseline levels at the
end of the recording period (F2,24=4.65,𝑃<.05; N–K, 𝑃<.001;𝑛=8). However, increasing the concentration of okadaic
acid to 1.0𝜇M [40] blocked the
induction of LTD. There was a variable and nonsignificant reduction in
responses immediately following conditioning stimulation (to 89.0±14.9% of
baseline) and responses were also near baseline levels after 30 minutes (96.0±6.6% of baseline 30; F2,22=0.18,𝑃=.84;𝑛=7; Figure 4). Activation of PP1 is therefore likely to contribute
to mechanisms of LTD in the entorhinal cortex.

Figure 4: The induction of LTD was blocked in
a dose-dependent manner by including okadaic acid in the recording electrode
solution to block activation of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). (a)
and (b) A low concentration of 0.1𝜇M okadaic acid failed to block LTD
induction, but raising the concentration to 1.0𝜇M resulted in a block of LTD
induction (compare traces in A1 versus A2). Responses in
control cells filled with 1.0𝜇M okadaic acid that did not receive conditioning
stimulation remained stable. The block of LTD by okadaic acid suggests that activation
of PP1 mediates LTD in the entorhinal cortex.

4. Discussion

The current paper has used prolonged repetitive
paired-pulse stimulation to induce LTD in layer I inputs to layer II neurons of
the medial entorhinal cortex and has determined the early postsynaptic signals
that mediate LTD in these cells. Consistent with previous observations, the LTD
observed here was obtained in both putatively identified stellate [28] and
pyramidal [44] cells. The induction of LTD was blocked by the NMDA glutamate
receptor antagonist APV, and by the calcium chelator BAPTA, indicating that
calcium influx via NMDA receptors is required for LTD. The induction of LTD was
also blocked by the calcineurin inhibitor FK506, and by okadaic acid which
blocks activation of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a. Calcineurin is required for
LTD of deep layer inputs to layer II stellate cells [28], and
calcineurin-dependent activation of PP1 contributes to NMDA receptor-dependent
LTD of AMPA responses in the hippocampus [2, 4].

The dependence of LTD in the entorhinal cortex
on activation of NMDA receptors has been a consistent finding in vivo and in
slices. It has been observed following stimulation protocols including 1 Hz trains,
pairing of presynaptic stimulation at 0.33 Hz with postsynaptic depolarization
[28], repeated paired-pulse stimulation [18, 33], and spike-timing-dependent
induction of LTD [44]. Long-term depression was blocked by including the calcium
chelator BAPTA in the recording electrode solution (Figure 2) [28], and this is
consistent with calcium influx via NMDA receptors as a critical trigger for
entorhinal LTD. Metabotropic glutamate receptor activation and release of
calcium from intracellular stores can contribute to LTD in the hippocampus [2, 36, 37, 45], but activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors is not required
for entorhinal LTD [18, 28]. Calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium
channels can contribute to spike-timing-dependent LTD in the entorhinal cortex,
however. Cells with broadened action potentials that result in larger calcium transients show greater NMDA
receptor-dependent spike-timing-dependent LTD in layer II-III cells [44]. Calcium influx through voltage-gated
channels also mediates bidirectional spike-timing-dependent plasticity of
inhibitory synapses in entorhinal cortex [46]. A form of long-term depression
on layer V-VI neurons, expressed presynaptically through reduced transmitter
release, is also dependent on activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels
[33]. Calcium signalling mediated by voltage-gated channels therefore plays a
number of roles in modulating synaptic plasticity in the entorhinal cortex.

The contribution of the
calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin to LTD was tested by
incubating slices in cyclosporin A or by including FK506 in the recording
electrode solution. Cyclosporin A appeared to cause a partial block of LTD, and
responses were reduced to 82.4% of baseline as compared to 58.6%
in untreated cells (compare Figures 1(c)
and 3(a)), but the sizes of these LTD effects were not statistically different.
We obtained a more conclusive result with FK506, however, and LTD was
completely blocked by including FK506 in the recording electrode solution. Including
FK506 in the bathing medium has been used to block calcineurin-dependent
depression effects in entorhinal cortex [28], and in excitatory [47] and
inhibitory [48] synapses of the CA1 region. Here, we have loaded FK506 into the
recording electrode solution to avoid possible presynaptic effects of the drug
and to ensure that FK506 could act on calcineurin [39, 40, 49, 50]. The
block of LTD by FK506 indicates that LTD is dependent on calcineurin, and this
suggests that cyclosporin A resulted in only a partial block of calcineurin
activity.

Calcineurin is thought
to mediate expression of LTD in part by dephosphorylating inhibitor 1 and
thereby increasing the activity of PP1 [2, 4, 39]. The PP1/PP2a inhibitor okadaic
acid blocks LTD in the CA1 region [38, 40], and we have shown here that the induction
of LTD in the entorhinal cortex was blocked by including okadaic acid in the
recording electrode solution. This is the first report of LTD in the entorhinal
cortex dependent on PP1/PP2a. Protein phosphatases can regulate synaptic
function through a variety of mechanisms [51] that include dephosphorylation of
the ser-845 residue on the AMPA GluR1 subunit, and LTD in the entorhinal cortex
may be expressed partly through this mechanism. In addition, the work of Deng
and Lei [28] has found entorhinal LTD to be associated with a reduction in the
number of postsynaptic AMPA receptors, with no change in AMPA receptor
conductance, and has shown that this effect is dependent on proteosomes that degrade
AMPA receptors internalized through ubiquitinization. As in the hippocampus,
therefore, entorhinal LTD can be expressed through mechanisms involving
trafficking of AMPA receptors [52].

Long-term depression was induced here using
strong repetitive paired-pulse stimulation which we have used previously to
induce LTD in the entorhinal cortex in vivo and in slices ([17, 18], see also [33, 34]). LTD was induced following 15 minutes, but not 7.5 minutes of paired-pulse
stimulation; this is consistent with a requirement for prolonged activation of
calcium-dependent signalling mechanisms, and is also consistent with the
possibility that NMDA receptor-dependent metaplastic changes early in the train
may promote LTD induced by stimuli that occurred later in the 15-minute
duration trains [53]. We previously found 1 Hz stimulation to be ineffective in
vivo and in slices from Long-Evans rats [17, 18], but deep layer inputs to
stellate neurons in slices from 2 to 3 week-old Sprague-Dawley rats express
NMDA receptor-dependent LTD following 15 minutes of 1 Hz stimulation, or
following low-frequency stimulation paired with postsynaptic depolarization [28].
Thus, there may be developmental, strain-related, or pathway-specific factors
that affect the ability of 1 Hz stimulation to activate these signalling mechanisms.

The entorhinal cortex
is embedded within the temporal lobe through an extensive array of anatomical
connections [7] and has been linked behaviorally to a variety of sensory and
cognitive functions (e.g., [9, 10]). Lasting synaptic plasticity in the
entorhinal cortex is therefore likely to serve a variety of functions depending
on the synaptic pathways involved. Synaptic depression effects are generally thought
to complement synaptic potentiation during the formation of memory [45, 54–56], and it is possible that depression effects contribute to short and/or
long-term memory processing. However, the laminar architecture of the
entorhinal cortex, with superficial layers mediating much of the cortical input
to the hippocampal formation, suggests that long-term depression of synaptic
transmission in layer II may lead to long-term reductions in the salience of
particular elements or patterns of cortical input and may thus lead to lasting
changes in the multimodal inputs processed by the hippocampal formation. Similarly, the general resistance of the
entorhinal cortex to induction of LTD could serve to maintain relatively stable
information processing and integration of multimodal sensory inputs within the
medial entorhinal cortex.

"Divesting Of Kruger’s Cash (Updated)

Freshman Sen. David Carlucci, one of 17 Senate Democrats who received campaign contributions from Sen. Carl Kruger during the 2010 election cycle, is getting rid of that money after learning of the federal corruption charges lodged against his colleague earlier today.

“It is unfortunate that these types of allegations have clouded the legislature, tainting the hard working men and women who work diligently and honorably to serve their constituents,” Carlucci said in a statement.

“I ran on a platform of ethics reform and these unsavory allegations are just another example of why ethics reform in Albany needs to be addressed immediately. The people of New York deserve better. In light of these allegations, I will be donating the $5,000 given to me during my campaign from Senator Kruger to a charitable organization in my district.”

All told, Kruger, a prodigious fundraiser who had close to $1.9 million in his campaign committee, “Friends of Carl,” as of Jan. 15, doled out $49,000 to fellow senators this cycle, according to campaign finance records on file at the state Board of Elections. He also gave $450,000 to the DSCC.

Sen. Gustavo Rivera, who received $2,500 from Kruger, was the first lawmaker to announce he would divest himself of the scandal-scarred Brooklyn lawmaker’s contributions. Now, apparently, all four of the Independent Democratic Conference members – Carlucci, Diane Savino, Jeff Klein, and Dave Valesky – are following suit.

UPDATE: DSCC spokesman Josh Cherwin says:

“We will not be returning these funds, which were contributed during a previous election cycle and already spent.”

“This is yet another sad day for New York residents who rightfully expect integrity and accountability from their elected officials.”

“During the last election cycle, Senator Kruger’s campaign committee contributed a combined total of $8,000 to Independent Democratic Conference members. We decided to donate that amount to charitable organizations in our communities. We believe this to be the best use for this money.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Holiday Punch — Plus a Cozy Fire

Charles Dickens gave us so much. Including this.

In A Christmas Carol,when Ebenezer Scrooge is presented with the Ghost of Christmas Present, he finds the ""jolly Giant"" sitting in state on an enormous heap of roast meats and other traditional English Christmas delicacies and flanked by ""seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.""

Charles Dickens knew all about delicious steam.

He was a committed English traditionalist in his drinking. He didn't drink the international celebrity's customary champagne, champagne, and more champagne or the trendy drinks of his day — gin cocktails, claret cups, brandy smashes, or the like. Rather, his greatest affinity was for a drink that was fading faster and faster into the past by the time he came into fame. From 1700 to 1830, give or take a couple years on each end, the preeminent English social drink was the bowl of punch, a large-bore mixture of spirits (usually rum and cognac), citrus juice, sugar, water, and spice that was guaranteed to unite any gathering in jollity and boozy good cheer. But with the industrialization, commercialization, and urbanization of day-to-day life that the Victorian years brought, the convivial ritual of clustering around the flowing bowl became as quaint and outmoded as the tricorn hat.

Dickens, however, not only bucked the trend but made a whole performance out of bucking it. When he was among friends, it was his custom to brew up a bowl of punch, complete with a running disquisition on the techniques he was using and the ingredients he was deploying, thus adding instruction to delight (as one of his characters might say). Fortunately, in 1847, he wrote the whole procedure out for a friend's wife. It's not hard to follow, and there's no better way to get a holiday party started than by getting everybody involved in draining a bowl of punch. All it takes is a little preparation in advance, a willingness to hold forth a bit in front of your guests, and a high enough ceiling that you won't burn your house down. Dickens was never afraid to employ cheap sensationalism if it would help him get over, and there's nothing more sensational for selling a drink than setting it on fire. Here's our interpretation.

Charles Dickens's Punch Ritual

For 12 to 16 people

Step 1: Three hours before your party, peel 3 lemons with a swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, trying to end up with three long spirals of peel. Put them in a 3- or 4-quart fireproof bowl with 3/4 cup demerara sugar or other raw sugar. Muddle the peels and the sugar together and let sit.

Talking Points: One of the secrets of punch making is to use the fragrant, sweet oil that resides in lemon peels as the sugar extract. The resulting sugar-oil mix (""oleo-saccharum"") adds body to the punch.

Talking Points: The cognac is for body and smoothness, the strong rum for bouquet and (frankly) flammability, and the other rum for taming the strong one.

Step 3: Set 1 quart water to boil and put the bowl containing the lemon peels and sugar on a wooden cutting board or other heat-resistant surface in a spot where everyone can gather around. When the water boils, turn it off, gather your guests around the bowl, and pour in the cognac and rum, noting what you're adding and why.

Step 4: With a long-handled barspoon, remove a spoonful of the rum-cognac mixture and set it on fire. Return it to the bowl, using it to ignite the rest.

Stir with a ladle or long-handled spoon, attempting to dissolve the sugar. Let burn for 2 or 3 minutes, occasionally lifting one of the lemon peels up so people can admire the flames running down it.

Talking Points: You're setting the punch alight not because it looks cool but to burn off some of the more volatile elements of the alcohol. That's the story, anyway.

Step 5: Extinguish the flames by covering the bowl with a tray, and add the reserved lemon juice and the boiling water. (For cold punch, add 3 cups cold water, stir, and slide in a 1-quart block of ice, easily made by freezing a quart bowl of water for 24 hours.)

Step 6: Grate fresh nutmeg over the top and ladle out in 3-oz servings.

In case you're disappointed that the end of the article is within reach,

flawlessly, the DivX encoding does not crop the picture to remove

The Huffington Post: Top Design Destinations for 2017

2017-02-23

By Janette Ewen

Ever since Frank Gehry’s spectacular Guggenheim Bilbao put its sleepy namesake city on the radar of architecture buffs two decades ago, design has became an integral aspect of travel and tourism, joining food, culture and climate when it comes to visitor draws. This year, the list of destinations sure to entice design fans includes spots from the West Indies to North Africa. They offer a wide range of aesthetic attractions, from cutting-edge urban design to exquisite historical gems.

OLD HAVANA, NEW URGENCY

Whether the recent detente between the United States and Cuba will result in an onslaught of American visitors to the island or not, Canadians aren’t waiting to find out: According to KAYAK, a world-leading travel search engine, Havana is one of the year’s top 10 trending destinations among travellers from the Great White North, whose online inquiries about the city skyrocketed by 230 percent compared to last year. In anticipation of more visitors, hotels in Havana are being modernized and restaurants given new polish, but it’s the bustling metropolis’ status as a living design museum that no doubt appeals to most foreigners. For architecture fans, hotels like the Nacional offer glimpses into long-gone eras, while automobile buffs would be hard-pressed to find a greater parade of vintage cars. Speaking of moveable feasts, bars like La Floridita, where Ernest Hemingway indulged his fondness for daiquiris, are modern-day links to literary and artistic legends. Clearly, the time to visit Havana is now, whatever your aesthetic bent.

CARIBBEAN COOL

Over the past several years, restaurant-rich Grand Cayman, the largest of the Cayman Islands, has been nurturing a reputation as the culinary capital of the Caribbean. Now, its growing foodie cred is being matched by its design cachet. In November, the ultra-sleek Kimpton Seafire Resort + Spa, designed by U.S. firm SB Architects, opened on Seven Mile Beach, bringing a welcome shot of global chic (plus four more dining options) to that pristine stretch of coastline. Not far away, Camana Bay, an ambitious mixed-use development, has been heralded as a rare example of new urbanism in the region, its 500 acres encompassing high-end shops, office and residential space, interactive fountains and a pedestrianized main street called the Paseo. Situated between the Kimpton and Camana Bay is the Caribbean Club, a luxury apartment hotel and ideal base for exploring the area; it also houses one of Grand Cayman’s foremost eateries, the trattoria Luca.

ROAD TO MOROCCO

Another top trender among Canadian travellers according to KAYAK is Casablanca, the romantic Moroccan city that has long offered a beguiling mix of French and Arabic cultures. Nowhere is this hybrid allure more visible than in its architecture, which ranges from the art deco elegance of Place Mohammed V to contemporary showstoppers like the Four Seasons Casablanca on the oceanfront Corniche. At bustling Marche Centrale, the Moorish-style setting is as enticing as the fried fish and grilled vegetables, while L’Atelier 21, the city’s leading modern art gallery, showcases emerging and established artists in an au courant space. New air links to Casablanca from Canada this year make visiting even easier.

LONDON CALLING

The British capital has always been a magnet for design aficionados, but 2017 offers an extra-special reason to visit: the recently transplanted Design Museum, which has been moved from its previous home on the south bank of the Thames to much larger digs in Kensington. Ten years in the making, the $140-million wood-and-concrete marvel, reimagined by minimalist architect John Pawson on the site of the former Commonwealth Institute, is the Brit superstar’s first public building in London. Visitors must pay to see special exhibitions, but the museum’s extensive permanent collection, which includes everything from a 2012 Olympic torch to a full-size Tube car, is free to view. Another area museum completing a major update this year is the venerable Victoria and Albert, which will unveil a new underground gallery and a new entrance on Exhibition Road in July. Even the city’s best watering holes are offering new eye candy: Check out the restored blue walls in The Berkeley’s expanded Blue Bar.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Those words (choice profanity included) woke me with a start the other night. What was I thinking, organizing this trip to Vietnam to connect sons and daughters who lost fathers on both sides of the Vietnam War?

I have a lot of fears about this journey. There’s the mundane ones about getting sick, or bitten by something slimy. Maybe I'll become separated from the group because something in a shop caught my eye (this, given my nature, is the most likely scenario). But the deeper fears are right under the surface. What’s going to happen when we come face to face with the Vietnamese sons and daughters? Will they be angry? Worse, will I?

It was easy to push past these bigger fears earlier this year when I first formed the 2 Sides Project. Now the trip is getting closer—we leave four weeks from today—and they’re keeping me up at night.

I’m going to have to remember what I know in the daylight: there have been moments in my life when I’ve found people who shared my experience, who spoke the same language as me, who felt the same way I did about things. These moments are profound. They make me feel connected, anchored in the world. They are often turning points that lead me to a better place.

That was the case when I met other sons and daughters in the U.S. who lost fathers in the war. So, I’ll keep my focus on them. And on the amazing experience we have in store. Six of us will be meeting Vietnamese sons and daughters and visiting the sites where our fathers died. I’ll profile them all -- Mike, Ron, Margaret, Susan and Patty -- here in the coming weeks as we get ready. Come with us virtually. It’s going to be quite a journey, and we’re looking forward to sharing it with you.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The case of the vanished sword

By
washingtonpost.com editors

By John Lockwood
Washington

One of our memorials is missing a sword.

The General Sherman memorial just south of the Treasury Building shows General William Tecumseh Sherman on horseback atop a 32-foot pedestal guarded at each ground-level corner by a soldier. The memorial was designed by a Danish sculptor named Carl Rohl-Smith. It was dedicated on Oct. 15, 1903.

The northwest soldier is an infantryman, holding his rifle by the barrel, with the butt resting on the ground. The southwest soldier is an engineer, holding his rifle in the same position. He also carries a cylinder or tube, about 3 feet long. Perhaps it contains surveying instruments. The southeast soldier is a cavalryman, with sword pointed upward across his left shoulder. At the northeast is an artilleryman — whose hands close upon empty air.

When I saw the northeast soldier, the question arose: Is he missing a rifle or a sword? Well, what would one of my heroes, Sherlock Holmes, do? Look for a cartridge box, or a scabbard.
There was a scabbard there, an empty one. So it was indeed a missing sword — a fact later verified in The Post’s Oct. 16, 1903, edition, which included a drawing showing the soldier with a sword, its point touching the ground.

The lost sword is probably rusting in somebody’s attic or slowly corroding in a landfill. I doubt even Holmes could find it now.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Penalty relief will only apply to eligible taxpayers or entities (i.e., turnover of less than $10 million) every three years.

Eligible individuals will only be given penalty relief on their tax return or activity statement if they make an inadvertent error because they either:
– took a position on income tax that is not reasonably arguable, or
– failed to take reasonable care

The ATO will not provide penalty relief when individuals have (in the past three years):
Received penalty relief
– Avoided tax payment or committed fraud
– Accrued taxation debts with no intention of being able to pay (i.e., phoenix activity)
– Previously penalised for reckless or intentional disregard of the law
– Participated in the management or control of another entity which has evaded tax.

Individuals can not apply for penalty relief. The ATO is reminding individuals that they will provide relief during an audit should it apply.

Penalty relief will not be applied to:
– Wealthy individuals and their businesses
– Associates of wealthy individuals (that may be deemed a small business entity in their own right)
– Public groups, significant global entities and associates

Penalty relief will also not be applied to certain taxes, i.e., fringe benefits tax (FBT) or super guarantee (SG).",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"**B Grade** CNPS12X Ultimate Performance Triple Fan CPU Cooler

Below is the original description for this product, any reference to warranty is to be ignored. Warranty for this item is 90 days as with all B Grade items.

B Grade items may have been used, have damaged packaging, missing accessories or a combination of these.

Some items may have scuff marks or slight scratches but should otherwise be an operable product.

Renowned for producing some of the world best CPU coolers, Zalman have now released their newest flagship cooler, the CNPS12X. It is the world's first ""out of the box"" triple fan cooler and is compatible with Intel latest LGA2011 Sandy Bridge E processors.

Worlds first ""out of the box"" triple fan CPU coolerThere are many CPU coolers available on the market that can accommodate three fans, but to make this happen at least one additional fan needs to be purchased which add to the expense. With the Zalman CNPS12X you get three 120mm blue LED fans built into the cooler so there is no extra costs. Also all three fans run off one fan header, making powering the fans extremely easy.

Six W-DTH composite heatpipes for excellent heat transferFirst seen on the CNPS11X, composite heatpipes help transfer the heat from the CPU up to 50% faster than standard heatpipes. This helps to increase the performance of the cooler even further. The six heatpipes are U-shaped, which effectively double the heat transfer compared to none U-shaped heatpipes.At the base of the cooler (where the heatpipes make contact with the CPU) the heatpipes utilise what Zalman call Whole-Direct Touch Heatpipes (W-DTH). This allows the heatpipes to make direct contact with the CPU, another feature to help increase performance. But not only that, the area of the Direct Touch will cover the whole CPU. Even the new Intel CPUs for LGA2011 will also be covered by W-DTH.

100% nickel plated with blue LED fans for amazing aestheticsMost CPU coolers are hidden inside the computer case where they go about their business unseen. But if you like to show off the internals of the PC you may want a CPU cooler than looks the part, and boy the CNPS12X does look the part!The entire heatsink of CNPS12X is plated with ""Black-Pearl"" nickel for a long-term corrosion resistance, while the deep ""Black-Pearl"" tone, along with the high intensity from the blue LED fans helps this cooler stand head and shoulders above the rest.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Four-ever? Competition remedies in the audit market

Oxera

In light of recent accounting scandals, there are widespread calls for the UK competition authority to re-examine the audit market. Yet spending a substantial amount of resources on a market investigation, and concluding once again that there is a competition problem, is of little value if a suitable remedy cannot be found. A break-up of the Big Four is perceived by many as a necessary and long-awaited intervention, but is it the right solution? And if not, what would be an alternative remedy?

The UK audit market has gone through some turmoil recently.[1] This month the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), which regulates UK audit, announced a deterioration in audit quality across the ‘Big Four’ firms (KPMG, PwC, Deloitte and EY) compared with the previous year. Most notably, the FRC noted that 50% of KPMG’s FTSE 350 audits failed to reach the FRC’s standard for audit quality.[2] At a global level, the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators found significant problems in 40% of the 918 audits of listed public interest entities that it inspected last year.[3]

The recent audit failures uncovered by regulators are hardly trivial. In Miller Energy the US Securities and Exchange Commission found that KPMG had overvalued certain assets by more than 100 times.[4] In BHS the FRC noted that PwC had signed off the accounts just days before the company was sold for £1.[5] In the more recent case of Carillion, equity analysts appeared unaware of the warning signs that might have been flagged by a good audit.[6]

These market outcomes in audit services are unsatisfactory from a policy perspective. The Big Four’s joint market share in FTSE 350 audit has been close to 100% for many years, and the Big Four likewise dominate the audit of large companies across the world. It is this high market concentration that is frequently blamed for the poor outcomes,[7] and regulators and competition authorities across the world have raised concerns about concentration ever since the collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2002. This year, two UK Parliamentary Committees have called for a new competition investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that ‘should explicitly include consideration of both breaking up the Big Four into more audit firms, and detaching audit arms from those providing other professional services’.[8] The Chief Executive Officer of the FRC and the CEO of PwC have both expressed support for the idea of having the CMA study the audit market afresh.[9]

Previous remedies in the audit market

The audit market is effectively dominated at the top end by the Big Four, and despite turmoil in financial markets the audit market structure has remained largely unchanged since 2002.[10] Concerns emanating from the high concentration include a lack of choice, a lack of innovation, higher audit fees, conflicts of interest, a lack of independence that weakens auditor professional scepticism, a systemic risk if one Big Four firm should fail, and, above all, poor-quality audit reducing the credibility and reliability of audited financial statements for the world’s largest companies.[11]

The previous investigation by the UK Competition Commission (CC), predecessor to the CMA, put forward a package of seven remedies, the most significant of which was a requirement that FTSE 350 companies put their audit out to tender at least every ten years (‘mandatory tendering’). Shortly thereafter, the EU introduced rules that obliged listed companies to switch their auditor (‘mandatory rotation’) every 20 years.[12] At the conclusion of the previous market investigation the CC expressed confidence in its package of remedies, noting that they should ‘increase choice’ and provide a ‘substantially improved environment for competition’.[13] The CC’s remedies package did not include any structural remedies.

The CC and EU remedies have not solved the problem of attracting more competition from outside the Big Four.[14] Indeed, the leading non-Big Four firms, Grant Thornton and BDO, between them have fewer FTSE 350 clients than before the regulatory interventions. In 2013, just before the new measures to boost competition were enacted, Grant Thornton had six FTSE 350 audit clients. In 2016, this number was unchanged. But in 2018 the firm said that it would exit the market for large audits.[15] In 2013 BDO had eight FTSE 350 clients, falling to five in 2016.[16] The previous rule changes are therefore widely perceived to have failed to remedy concerns over market concentration. The Big Four accountancy firms still audit 97% of FTSE 350 companies, a similar rate to that found by Oxera[17] in its 2006 market study for the FRC.[18]

What could structural remedies achieve?

Vertical separation

There are different types of structural remedies. Vertical separation of the Big Four firms into audit and non-audit services would not increase the basic number of firms participating in the FTSE 350 audit market, but it would increase the effective choice for many companies that have non-audit relationships with Big Four audit firms. These relationships can preclude, whether legally or in terms of company perception,[19] considering all four current audit firms as viable substitute auditors.[20]

Vertical separation would also be oriented towards audit quality, removing the conflicts of interest that can arise when the auditor also supplies valuable non-audit services. Yet the idea was not popular among investors at the time of the previous competition investigation. In 2012, an Oxera investor survey report found that ‘almost all investors surveyed do not want to see structural separation of the Big Four firms into audit and non-audit activities.’[21]

Horizontal separation

Horizontal separation of the Big Four firms would immediately improve choice in the sense of seeing more than four firms in the market, and also choice in terms of seeing several non-conflicted audit firms in every audit tender. Such a separation would therefore also, in general terms, improve competition. It could also serve audit quality by reducing the number of instances where a company involved in a complex transaction cannot realistically find an adviser that is not subject to some conflict of interest.

In the case of Carillion, PwC acted as the company’s pensions consultant (2002–17), then switched to advising the pension scheme trustees on Carillion’s restructuring proposals (from July 2017), and was finally appointed by the government to help manage the defunct Carillion after its collapse (from January 2018).[22] It would appear that PwC was the only viable choice to advise on Carillion’s insolvency, because it was the only Big Four firm that did not have active contracts with Carillion at the time of Carillion’s demise.[23] Expanding the market from a ‘Big Four’ to a ‘Large 6’ seems attractive in the face of such apparent conflicts, but realistically it would be a very difficult exercise if the aim is to create a ‘Large 6’ group of firms of similar size with similar international networks.

Would a break-up increase audit quality?

Audits are for the protection of investors against false accounting by a company’s management. The starting point is therefore that the true customer of audit, the investor, is not the procurer of audit services. This alone creates an environment in which market failures may be expected.

But why does audit quality fall short? Boeing and Airbus, Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and the Silicon Valley giants all operate in concentrated markets—but it seems highly unlikely that half of new aeroplanes, or soft drinks cans, possess substantial errors. Market concentration per se does not entail a poor-quality product: even a monopolist will have regard to product quality, knowing that if its product is faulty the financial consequences of fines and compensating consumers will typically be severe.

In equilibrium, a firm would only produce faulty items to the extent that it is rational to do so—i.e. if errors cannot be detected or if the financial consequences of errors are insubstantial. It seems to be widely accepted that audit quality is below the level demanded by investors, on whose behalf the audit is undertaken. The economics literature on audit has studied the link between greater market concentration and higher audit fees, but this does not help us very much in the present circumstances, where the primary concerns are not to do with high prices, or even exclusionary conduct, but with limited choice and sub-optimal quality. Where does the solution lie?

Penalties for poor-quality service

In public services markets (health, education) there is a high degree of regulatory supervision of quality—such as barring doctors who are found to be negligent, and awarding damages to patients harmed by negligence—even when the main providers are state-owned and have no incentive to chase profits at the expense of quality. In 2017, the UK National Health Service (NHS) estimated that the total liability for outstanding medical negligence cases could be as much as £56.1bn, and the £1.5bn annual NHS payout to settle claims is expected to double by 2023.[24] In audit, the strength of regulatory supervision by the FRC is subject to an independent review following concerns that it lacks adequate powers to intervene in the market.[25]

However, the FRC has recently been levying higher fines for audit errors. It fined PwC £6.5m regarding failed UK retailer, BHS;[26] £5.1m for its auditing of accountancy group, RSM Tenon (also, ironically, an auditor);[27] and £5m in relation to the property company, Connaught.[28] The other Big Four firms have also faced heavy fines, in both the UK and USA: £1.8m for EY’s auditing of Tech Data;[29] £4.8m for KPMG’s work on Miller Energy;[30] and £4m for Deloitte relating to the audit of Aero Inventory.[31] The FRC is also fining audit partners whom it finds to be responsible for misconduct—for example, the lead partner for BHS has been fined £325k and banned from working as an auditor for 15 years.[32] These FRC penalties are, however, minor relative to the £38m audit-related settlement reached by the UK’s largest pension scheme, USS, with PwC Brazil as part of a class action lawsuit against troubled oil giant, Petrobras.[33] But note that the FRC has this month implemented an increase in fines to £10m or more for ‘seriously poor audit work by a Big 4 firm’, following an independent review in 2017 of FRC sanctions.[34]

Are audit fines providing optimal enforcement?

From an economics perspective, if the deterrence effect of penalties is sufficiently severe, firms that might otherwise chase market share by cutting prices and their costs for a given audit will be deterred from cutting quality. In other words, when deterrence is weak, there is an opportunity for rent-seeking by firms that cut quality on unobservable dimensions. Although it might be argued that the cost to an accountant’s reputation is great enough to give the right incentives, this point seems difficult to sustain in light of the continued flourishing of firms that have had quite major hits to their professional reputations.

How large would audit fines need to be in order to deter bad audit? This article cannot provide the answer, but it may be instructive to look at a comparison between audit fines and cartel fines (in the EU). The latter are set based on the European Commission’s criteria. As the Commission explains:

The Commission’s policy with regards to competition law infringements is one of prevention … [fines] are ultimately aimed at prevention, and must hence fulfil two objectives: to punish and to deter. Breaking the competition rules is profitable if it goes unpunished – that is why companies do it.[35]

European Commission cartel fines are set based on the gravity and the duration of a competition infringement, and are capped at a maximum of 10% of a company’s total turnover. The 10% turnover ceiling for fines is engaged only when a cartel fine based on the usual criteria would otherwise be set at more than 10% of turnover.

Cartel fines are large compared with audit fines, as Tables 1 and 2 illustrate. Looking at FRC audit fines in the cases mentioned above, the average fine is 0.016% of a Big Four firm’s annual global turnover, as shown in Table 1. The final column of Table 1 indicates that increasing this percentage to 0.5% would lead to fines of a much greater order of magnitude. This is purely illustrative; it is not a recommendation as to the optimal size of audit fines.

Source: FRC and the audit firms’ annual reports for fiscal year 2017.

How do cartel fines compare? Weighted by the number of fines falling into each percentage bracket of turnover, the average European Commission cartel fine is 2.40% of turnover. This means that cartel fines expressed as a percentage of global turnover are about 150 times larger (2.40% divided by 0.016%) than FRC audit fines measured in the same way. Table 2 shows the calculation of the weighted average European Commission cartel fine.[36]

Table 2 European Commission weighted average cartel fines as a percentage of a company’s global turnover

Source: European Commission cartel statistics, last updated 21 March 2018.

It might be argued that increased deterrence for poor audit would come at the cost of competition, such as financial penalties leading to market exit and a ‘Big Three’, or hiking the barriers to entry for non-Big Four audit firms. Likewise, the Commission does not wish to fine a cartel with penalties that are so high that the consequence would be a reduction in the number of market competitors (or else the competition remedy would be self-defeating). Hence the scaling of cartel fines to turnover, and the ‘inability to pay’ test, whereby the Commission can reduce the scale of fines where it is shown that they pose a serious threat to the economic viability of the undertaking concerned. Scaling audit fines to audit firm turnover makes it unlikely that such penalties would deter entry or cause the market exit of one of the Big Four. The cartel fines policy therefore has useful principles, albeit it does not indicate the right order of magnitude for audit fines.

Fines set as a percentage of turnover would of course decline if measured against a smaller metric for revenue. As a hypothetical exercise, taking Big Four audit-only revenues as the denominator, the FRC fines mentioned previously would be on average 0.039% of the firms’ global audit-only revenues. In this scenario cartel fines at 2.40% of global turnover would be about 60 times greater than the FRC recent audit fines (2.40% divided by 0.039%), and a hypothetical fine of 0.5% of audit fines would amount to between £45m and £60m. The latter figures are much closer to the penalties proposed in last year’s independent review of FRC sanctions—i.e. ‘£10 million or more (before any discount)’. Note also that the independent review recommended that ‘the figure could be well above [£10m] if dishonesty or conscious wrongdoing were involved.’[37]

Evidence on the deterrence effect of cartel fines can be found in the economics literature. Professor Stephen Davies at the ESRC Centre for Competition Policy estimates that cartel deterrence is highly effective:

On the most conservative of our estimates, more than half of all potential cartel harm never occurs, because it is deterred. This is very much a lower bound, and the proportion could be as high as 90%.[38]

Similar research would be required to understand the effects of a different penalty regime for poor audit.

Break-up or shake-up?

There is little doubt that a new CMA investigation would consider a break-up remedy. However, no matter what the divestments and structural changes, the inherent tension within the industry’s ‘client pays’ business model is likely to remain—that is, an auditor’s basic conflict between serving the paying client and serving the greater good.

If it were to address that conflict, the CMA would need to look into penalties and deterrence, as well as studying the effects of a break-up remedy. It is not realistic to expect the CMA to be able to fix every major issue in the market by achieving the goal of reduced concentration in FTSE 350 audit.

The quality of audit might be improved with a more disaggregated market, but this link is not certain. Moreover, it is possible that greater deterrence for bad audit would lead to an organic change in market structure: the Big Four have expertise in advising clients as to when a substantial divestment or restructuring might increase shareholder value. It seems possible that, in a world of greater deterrence, the accounting firms might look inwards using this expertise and shake up the market structure themselves.

Possibly the Big Four firms are already thinking along these lines. According to a letter from the two MPs who led the parliamentary review on Carillion, voluntary break-up scenarios are now under active consideration:

Since our report was published, Bill Michael, Chairman KPMG UK, said his firm had been thinking about break-up scenarios ‘for some time’ as the current business model of the Big Four is ‘unsustainable’. Mr Michael is quoted as saying:

‘The profession, like it or not, is an oligopoly. You can’t be all things to all men and women forever. We have to reduce the level of conflicts and demonstrate why they are manageable and why the public and all stakeholders should trust us.’

Other Big four firms have reportedly begun making preparations for a break-up.[39]

Finally, the example of cartel fines shows that they are of a different scale to audit fines, raising the question as to whether fines should be reconsidered in the audit market. Penalties for anticompetitive conduct are used for prevention, not retribution. An audit firm with consistent high quality would have a minimal incidence of fines, which would place the high-quality firm at a competitive advantage to an audit firm with lower quality.[40] If audit quality became high across the market, no firm would be faced with very substantial financial penalties, and investor perceptions as to the value of statutory audit might be restored. In summary: prevention is better than cure.

Lord Conqueror of the Realm

Written by WarriorJudge

Part 19

In northern Greece , in the tavern on the border between Philippi and Macedonia , Nobleman Verosus and Nobleman Marton met with Domitia, in a room they had rented. The two Noblemen could not afford being overheard or even being seen in public with the lass.

""I don't understand. What did you do wrong?"" the frustrated Nobleman Marton shouted at poor Domitia, who of no fault of her own found herself in this impossible and dangerous position. It was all Nobleman Marton could do not to resort to physical violence.

""I did exactly as I'd been told…"" the young woman tried to defend herself.

Nobleman Verosus sent his fist through the wall. ""Then the Conqueror should have been all over you… in and out of you!"" he yelled and his eyebrows nearly touched together.

""The Conqueror wouldn't touch me,"" said Domitia.

Both Noblemen were still waiting for a reasonable explanation for this brilliant failure.

""Perhaps the Conqueror loves the Queen,"" she suggested quietly and shrugged.

Both men burst into laughter.

""Young women… All soft in the head… some of them never learn…"" said Nobleman Verosus .

""Silly child,"" said Nobleman Marton, ""the Conqueror doesn't love. The Conqueror lusts, lusts after power, lusts after blood and lusts after women, that is all. That is the source of her power. That's what sets her ever so highly above the rest of her sex. She feels no emotions and so she isn't governed by them.""

""Well, the Lord Conqueror did marry the Queen,"" argued Domitia.

""She only married her concubine to spite us, to show us who truly rules the Empire. It is common knowledge even amongst complete idiots!""

Nobleman Marton turned to Nobleman Verosus and said, ""We must consider the possibility that the Conqueror didn't take this silly girl over here because she realized it was all a ploy.""

""By the Gods… what shall we do? Should we run?"" Terror began to tighten its grip over Nobleman Verosus and he began fidgeting like a skittish horse.

""We are governors, we can't just disappear. Besides, there is no escaping the Conqueror. There is no place to hide, no place out of the Conqueror's reach. If we run now, the Conqueror will know we're guilty. Let me think…"" Nobleman Marton said.

After some time had elapsed in silence with both men pacing restlessly from wall to wall, Nobleman Marton continued: ""Lady Messalina won't say anything. She's neck deep in this and she has too much to lose.""

""The Lord Conqueror knows nothing more than my name, and I am hardly the only Domitia in the Realm,"" she said. ""And I wore nothing that would imply my station.""

""That's very good. We might just come out of it alive,"" he said.

***

Two days had gone by. The Conqueror and the Queen were taking a stroll in the Imperial gardens, near the lily pond that the Queen adored so much. As they walked together side by side, enjoying the morning sun, the odor of blossoms and the light exercise, Gabrielle recalled the days when she had been a slave. How she used to walk in these magnificent gardens, trying to understand her Lord's moods and actions. It felt like a lifetime ago. As if to remind herself that she was in a different place now, that those days were over, Gabrielle reached for her Lord and interlaced her arm with the Conqueror's.

""They are all waiting for us in the Great Hall,"" Gabrielle said.

""Let them wait,"" the Conqueror smiled and looked at her Queen, while pressing a gentle hand over the pregnant Queen's back for support.

""There is one thing that isn't clear to me, why didn't Lady Messalina wait until after nightfall to tell me about the girl?""

""Whoever set this entire subterfuge didn't take two things into account. I wasn't familiar with the informant that disclosed Perous' whereabouts. I wasn't sure whether I could trust him or not, and I wasn't about to march blindly into a trap on the 'say so' of an informant I knew nothing about. First, I sent a scout to check the area and to confirm that Perous was indeed there and that he was alone. That took time,"" explained the Conqueror.

""And the second thing?""

""That I would return from Cyra alone and leave my forces behind… My desire to see you was too great. I couldn't wait.""

The Queen rose to stand on her toes and placed a warm heartfelt kiss on the Conqueror's jaw, the highest place she could reach.

""You know, my Lady, you are the Realm's Sovereign.""

""I know, my Lord,"" the Queen said and wondered why her Lord chose this time to remind her of that fact.

""And Lady Messalina is one of your ladies in waiting. She is your responsibility,"" the Conqueror said.

The reason for the Conqueror's words began to become apparent and clear to her. ""I assume treason is punishable by death, my Lord?""

""It is, my Lady.""

As they were nearing the gates of the palace, the Queen turned to the Conqueror, ""My Lord?""

""Hmmm…?""

""Death is the most sever penalty for treason, is it not?"" the Queen asked.

The Conqueror smiled for she understood the meaning and the reason for the Queen's question.

""It is, my Lady.""

***

""The Lord Conqueror and her Majesty the Queen,"" the ceremony master announced as the Conqueror and the Queen entered the Great Hall.

As the Conqueror and the Queen made their way to their thrones, all present in the Great Hall bowed before them until they reached their destination and seated themselves.

""Noblemen and Ladies of the Realm,"" the Conqueror exclaimed, ""We have summoned you all here due to a grave matter which has come to our attention and requires further investigation.""

The noblemen and the ladies of the Realm began to look at one another agitatedly to see if anyone had any idea as to what the Conqueror was referring to.

""Lady Messalina,"" the Queen called.

Lady Messalina approached the thrones. ""Your Majesties,"" she said and bowed before them.

As she stood before them, the Conqueror leaned over and whispered something in the Queen's ear.

""Lady Messalina, is it not true that just before noon on the day of my Lord's return from Cyra, you informed me that a young lass had been seen entering the Imperial tent?""

Lady Messalina's blood drained from her face and she grew as pale as a sheet. ""It is true, your Majesty,"" she admitted.

""And how did you come by this bit of information?"" the Queen inquired further.

""I… I can't remember, your Majesty,"" replied the nervous lady.

""Is it not true, that the lass in question is your very own daughter?""

Lady Messalina nearly fainted. The crowd around her gasped in surprise and walked backwards away from her, as if trying to disassociate themselves from her.

""It is, your Majesty."" At this stage, lady Messalina had already realized there was no point in lying.

""Was it not your intention to cause dispute between my Lord and myself?""

Lady Messalina threw herself at the Queen's feet and began kissing them.

""You will stand up,"" the Queen ordered and her assertiveness gave pause to her subjects.

Lady Messalina rose back to her feet.

""You will answer the question.""

""I will your Majesty,"" Lady Messalina replied.

""Did you act on your own volition?""

""No, your Majesty.""

""Who put you up to this?"" asked the Queen.

""Please, your gracious Majesty, I beg you please don't make me…""

""Nobleman Verosus and Nobleman Marton!"" the Conqueror exclaimed.

Both men made their way through the crowd, mortified, joined their accomplice and bowed before the thrones.

""What have you got to say for yourselves?"" the Conqueror's voice was ominous.

""Indeed not, but when her Majesty the Queen asked the question, Lady Messalina threw a glance at the two of you,"" said the Conqueror. ""That confirmed my suspicions.""

Noblemen Marton and Verosus confessed to the specifics of their scheme for all to hear by orders of the Conqueror, without trying to cast responsibility at one another and minimizing their own involvement in the traitorous conspiracy.

""Is my Lady prepared to render her verdict in the matter of Lady Messalina?"" the Conqueror asked.

""I am, my Lord,"" the Queen replied.

""Lady Messalina, you have handled yourself poorly and reprehensibly. Being a Queen's lady in waiting is a sacred duty. It has been proven to my satisfaction that you have betrayed that duty and my trust. You have been disloyal to me and disloyal to my Lord and to the Realm. You've tried by despicable means to come between my Lord and myself. This offense I cannot and will not pardon. However, I am satisfied that there are mitigating circumstances since you were extorted. Desperation deprives some of rational thought and behooves them to take desperate measures. Therefore, it is my verdict that you should be stripped of your station and be banished from the Realm forthwith for my Lord's pleasure."" The Queen voice was steady, firm and confident.

""Noblemen Marton and Verosus, greed and malice are no defense against treason. Your actions solicited, financed and facilitated an act of rebellion against us and against this Realm, which resulted in the death of several subjects and warriors of the Realm. Moreover, you have extorted her Majesty the Queen's lady in waiting and exploited her innocent daughter. You and your families will be stripped of your station and possessions. Marton and Verosus, you shall suffer a quick death in three days time. As for Macedonia , I hereby appoint Lila of Potidaea as the new governor to Macedonia and a Lady of this Realm. As for Philippi, I hereby appoint her Majesty the Queen's lady in waiting, Satrina, as the new governor to Philippi, if it pleases you, your Majesty,"" the Conqueror asked the Queen.

""It does, my gracious Lord,"" smiled the Queen.

As the guards came to remove the condemned men from the Great Hall, Lady Satrina scurried to bow before the Conqueror and the Queen.

""Your Majesties, I cannot thank you enough for your infinite kindness, honor and generosity your Majesties have shown me, and I am grateful with all my heart and soul for the great trust you place in me, but I pray you, if I may,"" she said and her excitement was evident in her voice.

""You may,"" granted the Queen.

""With your Majesties' permission, and if it pleases you, I wish to remain in her Majesty the Queen's presence and service for I am so very contented and happy with my life here in the palace,"" she said. ""I could not have hoped to serve a kinder, nobler Sovereign than our benevolent Queen.""

The Queen glanced over at the Conqueror with questioning eyes and the Conqueror, who was the one who first granted the honor, nodded her consent. Their subjects could not help but notice the silent exchange between them.

""As you wish, Lady Satrina and thank you,"" the Queen said and did her best to remain formal and regal and not let her own excitement be known in the forum.

""Captain Cornelius of the Imperial Guard,"" announced the ceremony master.

The Queen wasn't familiar with the name.

With wide determined strides, fitting a military man, Captain Cornelius approached the thrones and bowed before his Rulers.

""Your Majesties,"" he greeted.

It was then that the Queen recognized whom he was and fought an urge to move uncomfortably on her throne.

""With your permission, your Majesty,"" he humbly said and turned his attention to the Queen.

""Granted,"" said the Queen.

""I come before your gracious Majesty, a humble servant, to beg for forgiveness. In the past your Majesty showed me great kindness and granted excellent remedy, which I, I am ashamed to say, repaid with gross disrespect.""

He chose this grand forum to offer his genuine remorse, rather than offer his apologies in private. In his mind, since he disrespected the Queen in the presence of the healer and others in the infirmary, it was only just that he should surrender his pride to the Queen in public.

He was also careful not to divulge any specifics of his transgression, including the fact that he was referring to the times back when the Queen had been a slave, so as not to cause the Queen either discomfort or embarrassment.

""I am sorry to say, I was foolish and a proud brute and I know in my heart I am not worthy of your Majesty's pardon. I assure your Majesty that as a result of your Majesty's dignity, generosity and supreme conduct towards me, which I didn't deserve I have mended my ways. I submit myself before you, your Majesty to punish as your Majesty deems fit,"" he said and knelt before the Queen.

""Stand up, Captain,"" she ordered and he obeyed.

""Your past misdeeds towards me are pardoned,"" the Queen said, then covered her mouth and whispered a private question in her Lord's ear, to which the latter nodded her agreement.

""You have exhibited candor and great honor, which leads me to believe your repentance is true and sincere. I hereby appoint you a nobleman to the Realm and a governor to Philippi ,"" the Queen said.

He lowered his head in humility and thanked his Queen for the bounty she had bestowed upon him.

""That concludes our business here today, Nobleman and Ladies of the Realm,"" the Conqueror stated, stood up and offered her arm to assist her pregnant Queen to her feet.

Standing in front of their subjects, the Conqueror went on to say, ""As I trust you all know, today I have shown great leniency towards Marton and Verosus for their appalling treachery. By no means must you perceive it as any form of a precedent. I shall see no further division in this Realm.""

As the Queen and her Lord made their way out of the Great Hall, their subjects bowed before them then began clapping their hands and chanting, "" Hail to the Queen. ""

Whilst strolling along the corridor that led to the Imperial chambers, the curious Queen asked, ""How did my Lord know that the lass in Cyra was Messalina's daughter?""

""They have the same shade of hair color and the shape of their eyes and chins are exactly alike,"" the Conqueror explicated.

Alone in the privacy of their chambers, the Conqueror turned to her Queen took her small hands in hers and said with bright eyes, ""I am so very proud of you, my Lady,"" and adorned the thin fingers with tender kisses.

***

After three days had passed, Marton and Verosus were brought to the gallows upon a wagon, which resembled one that was fit to carry small livestock. In the square stood a large crowd, as with any execution. The Conqueror always believed that even regular people, non-warriors were fascinated by death and were curious to see life as it was leaving the body. If someone else did the actual killing, then all the better.

Heavily guarded, the two men were escorted up the podium to face their Ruler and executioner. Verosus's neck was first to be stretched out and presented before the Conqueror.

As he was waiting, trembling on his knees and mumbling unintelligible words, the Conqueror unsheathed her sword, which was resting over her chiseled thigh in a leather scabbard. The polished, long and well-whetted blade caught the sun's rays.

The crowed cursed at the condemned men and cheered for their Sovereign, goading her on. It wasn't a novelty. The Conqueror knew that once she would lay the deadly strike, the cheers and the cursing would halt.

With one strike, the Conqueror put an end to his mumbling, and his severed head rolled over the floor of the podium, which was covered with sawdust to absorb the spilt blood, and his headless corpse slumped to the ground next to it.

Then came Marton's turn. Before he was shoved down to his knees by the guards and into his accomplice's pool of freshly spilt blood, the Conqueror leaned slightly towards him and whispered into his ear: “You do realize this is not retribution for some silly, inconsequential rebellion, which could have been handled quickly by a single battalion of my forces. This is mainly for trying to come between me and my Queen.”

His shocked expression was still frozen on his face when the Conqueror removed his head from his shoulders.

As the Conqueror wiped the blood off her sword and looked at Marton's head next to her boots, her mind strayed back to another execution which she had performed, the one of the British Captain, who had raped and killed some body slave, whose name the Conqueror couldn't even remember now.

Before she had sent him to his death, the Conqueror had desired to make it perfectly clear to the Captain the true and exact reason for his chastisement. When he had extended his head forward before her, whilst on his knees, she'd hissed at him, “This is for putting your filthy hands on what's mine. The slave you've raped and killed was just an excuse.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Connect The Dots

In her firstbook Stay Hungry Stay Foolish Rashmi Bansal profiled twenty five entrepreneurs who were alumni of IIM – Ahmedabad. Many had then wondered including yours truly, how important an MBA degree is to become an entrepreneur. Rashmi claims this inspired her to write Connect The Dots, story of twenty one entrepreneurs but who dont have an MBA degree. The format of the book is same as her last book. There are twenty chapters, one on each entrepreneur (Gaurav Rathore & Saurabh Vyas who co founded PoliticalEDGE are covered in one chapter) and the entire chapter is based on one single interview.

The book is divided in three sections : Jugaad, Junoon & Zubaan. Jugaadis are those who didn’t get any formal training in business but learned by observing, experimenting and applying their mind. It includes some one like Kunwer Sachdev of Su-Kam who created a Rs 500 crore company from scratch; Ganesh Ram, who started what is today India’s largest English training academy, VETA when there were no BPOs and no one knew that English coaching would be as big a market as it is now.

Junoonis as the name suggests, are passionate about something that is ahead of its time. This was my favorite section in the book. Gaurav Rathore and Saurabh Vyas envisioned a consulting and research firm exclusively for politics and founded PoliticalEDGE; Satyajit Singh, founder of Shakti Sudha not only created a new industry but also benefited thousands of farmers in rural Bihar; Chetan Maini, founder of Reva, designed a solar car and has been producing electric cars since the time when global warming was not so well known and creating electric cars seemed to make little sense.

The third section Zubaan is about creative people like Paresh Mokashi, creator of Harishchandrachi Factory, India’s official entry to Oscar last year or Krishna Reddy, whose Prince Dance Group, consisting of daily wage laborers won India’s Got Talent last year.

I had great hopes from the book as I loved Stay Hungry Stay Foolish. The first chapter on Prem Ganpathy is literally a rags to riches story of someone who came to Mumbai with no money and now owns Dosa Plaza, a fast food chain with 26 outlets in the country.The rest of the stories too are very encouraging. The book is replete with inspiring anecdotes and quotes . When I read the synopsis on the third section i.e. Zubaan, I thought it would be probably the weak link in this book as stories on creatives who had made it big in the field of art would be a misfit in this book about entrepreneurs. However, all these artists achieved commercial success by following their passion and this justifies their inclusion in this book about Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship after all is about following your heart.

Generally when the first book is good and successful authors fail to recreate the magic in their subsequent books and that too in the same genre, as people have high expectations. In this case Rashmi Bansal definitely exceeded my expectations. A very good book and must read for some one aspires to be an entrepreneur.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Ancient toolmaking site discovered near Niagara Falls

Archaeologists have found arrowheads and drills, indicating that the camps were occupied for extended periods of time.

DIGGING FOR TOOLS: Students at work in 2006 excavating a feature at the site on Grand Island that was most likely a hearth. (Photo: L.M. Anselmi)

An ancient campsite where people were manufacturing tools has been discovered near the Niagara Falls.

This find, combined with other archaeological discoveries in the area over the past few decades, suggests that such campsites lined the Niagara River as far back as 4,000 years ago.

So far, the team has unearthed more than 20,000 artifacts, mostly bits of rock broken off when people were creating stone tools, on the southeastern tip of Grand Island New York, about 12 miles (20 km) upstream from Niagara Falls. The earliest artifacts at the site date back at least 4,000 years, opening a window on a time when people were living a nomadic lifestyle based on hunting, fishing and gathering plants. [In Photos: Digging Up Niagara's History]

""I would anticipate that there would have been, back in the day, these kinds of campsites all along the Niagara River on both sides and on both sides of the island,"" team leader Lisa Anselmi, of Buffalo State University of New York, told LiveScience.

The archaeologists found that people at the Grand Island site were making a wide variety of tools, including spear points, arrowheads and even a few stone drills. Anselmi said that the drills ""would be sharp enough to go through a piece of leather... or go through shell or some bone to create a bead.""

The team also found bits of yellow and red ochre at the site; in ancient times it was common, for religious reasons, for ochre to be applied on the skin of someone who was being buried. No evidence of burials has been found so far at the site.

Stretching across time

The south tip of Grand Island appears to have been occupied for an extended time.

Fragments of pottery dating between 2,900 and 1,500 years ago found by Anselmi and her colleagues suggest inhabitants experimented with ceramic production, using pots to collect nuts and plant remains.

The team also found spear points that date back around 500 years, to a period shortly before Europeans started arriving in the area. More recent artifacts included nails from houses built in the 19th century and bullets that appear to date to the 1930s or 40s.

Anselmi said that the site probably would have been used mainly between the spring and fall, when food would have been plentiful. ""The island would have had the advantage of being close to the river (with) lots of freshwater fish and other kinds of resources from the river,"" she said. Also, ""in all likelihood there would have been a very strong deer population on the island.""

Crossing the Niagara River

To get to Grand Island people in antiquity would have had to cross the Niagara River. Today, the fast-flowing waterway moves at a rate of about 2-3 feet per second near the island.

Curiously, rather than making use of rock found on the island, the ancient people imported a type of Onondaga chert — a tough limestone that they would have had to carry across the river from the mainland.

Anselmi explained that they would have brought over small bits of this rock that could then be molded into tools. ""It's not necessarily that they're filling a canoe up with boulders,"" she said.

By using Onondaga chert the people of Grand Island were continuing a toolmaking tradition that goes back to when people were first entering New York State.

For instance, at a site called Emanon Pond, located in western New York, people were using the material almost exclusively nearly 11,000 years ago.

""With the exception of a single projectile point made from glacially derived drusy quartz, all of the artifacts are manufactured using local Onondaga chert,"" write Peter Neal Peregrine and Melvin Ember in the North America edition of the ""Encyclopedia of Prehistory,"" published in 2001.

The findings were presented in May at a meeting of the Toronto chapter of the Ontario Archaeological Society.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Commonwealth Bank and the Australian Chamber Orchestra kick off the 2009 Great Romantics national tour

Sydney, 11 June 2009: The Commonwealth Bank today congratulated the Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO) on the commencement of its Great Romantics Tour.

Commonwealth Bank Group Executive Human Resources and Group Services, Ms Barbara Chapman, said the Group was committed to supporting the Arts in Australia and helping its customers, staff and the Australian community engage with music at the highest level.

“As a partner of the ACO since 1988, we have been privileged to watch it grow into the world class orchestra that it is today,” she said.

“We are proud of our ongoing support and commitment to the ACO and excited to be the 2009 National Tour Partner for the Great Romantics.”

Ms Chapman said the Commonwealth Bank was especially proud to loan its rare Guadagnini violin – crafted in 1759 in Parma, Italy, and purchased by the Bank in 1996 – to ACO’s Principal Second Violin and leader of the ACO’s Emerging Artists Program, Helena Rathbone.

“We are delighted that on the violin’s 250th birthday, it is played by such an exquisite violinist for the enjoyment and appreciation of thousands of Australians,” she said.

Ms Chapman said the Bank’s partnership with the ACO was one of three national Arts partnerships for the Group, which included Opera Australia and Bangarra Dance Theatre.

The Australian Chamber Orchestra’s Artistic Director, Mr Richard Tognetti, said he was proud of the Orchestra’s long association with the Bank.

“When I started at the ACO in 1989, the Orchestra only had a handful of corporate supporters and we were in desperate need of committed companies who would be prepared to inject cash and help fuel some new ideas,” he said.

“My dream was to create a first-rate Australian Orchestra that could hold its own anywhere in the world. The Commonwealth Bank took a risk on my dreams and, 21 years on, we have one of the most fruitful corporate relationships I’ve ever seen.”

College or work? Gap year or victory lap? And how should a young person choose among the multitude of programs offered through universities, colleges or a combination of both?

Those are just some of the questions faced by today’s high school graduates.

In an era of tough competition for jobs, the rise of precarious employment and the disappearance of a linear path from school to work, teaching kids career and life planning is more important than ever.

But a new report from People for Education says Ontario students aren’t getting what they need from the province’s careers strategy, introduced over a three-year period beginning in 2013.

Principals surveyed by the research and advocacy group cited problems implementing the plan, a shortage of guidance counsellors and lack of teacher training to help students at all levels.

“The bottom line is it’s been hard for schools to implement this policy, which is a laudable policy, it’s something we need to be doing in our schools,” said Annie Kidder, executive director of People for Education. “We need to be thinking about the now multiple paths that our kids are going to end up being on as they grow up.”

“The evidence tells us now you’re probably going to have multiple jobs in multiple different areas and also multiple paths even through your education.”

So helping them understand themselves and their interests even as young students is key to making sure they have the tools to navigate a complex path.

The Ontario strategy includes such mandatory components as: portfolios for every student from kindergarten to Grade 12 to help them reflect on their interests, strengths, learning and later career possibilities; career and life-planning committees in every school; and professional development for teachers to help them integrate career and life planning into the classroom.

It is also linked to the existing 40 hours of mandatory community volunteering for high school students and the compulsory Grade 10 careers course.

The survey of 1,100 principals found:

Mandatory career and life-planning committees were in place in only 15 per cent of elementary schools and 39 per cent of high schools. And of those, only 8 per cent of secondary schools included community members.

Thirty-four per cent of elementary and 56 per cent of secondary schools reported that every student had a career/life-planning portfolio.

Teacher training on career and life planning was available at fewer than one in four elementary schools and 40 per cent of high schools.

While high school guidance counsellors are the primary staff members responsible for student portfolios and planning, 16 per cent of secondary schools don’t have a full-time guidance counsellor.

The average ratio is one counsellor for every 380 students — in line with what provincial funding provides — but one in 10 schools struggles with a ratio of 600 students per teacher.

Principals said two years of education labour disputes interfered with the new strategy, but also blamed lack of technology support, workload issues, and a lack of overall understanding of the policy.

“While lots of them talked about how great the policy was, an equal number talked about how difficult it was to implement,” says Kidder.

She cited “initiative exhaustion” among teachers and administrators following a stream of new education strategies ranging from math to well-being to experiential learning, which can leave staff overwhelmed. And she called for better integration of the career and life lessons with all school subjects.

For Bruce Lawson of the Counselling Foundation of Canada, making the most of the provincial strategy is key. And he says despite the challenges addressed in the report, it is one of the best in the country.

By the time today’s elementary students graduate, at least one third of the occupations open to them will be jobs that don’t currently exist, says Lawson, president of the foundation, which promotes career planning and development. For kindergarten students, it amounts to more than half.

“Given how the world is changing at such a rapid pace, we really need to equip young people with the skills, competency and resilience to be able to navigate the 21st-century workplace.”

Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan briefing parliment on the annal business report.South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Thursday the world was heading towards a ""currency war"" unless developed nations gave ground in negotiations at the Group of 20 (G20).

Gordhan told the 16th World Economic History Congress in Stellenbosch there was an imbalance between the locus of production and that of growth, and between political beliefs and the predominant reality.

“The question is, is there an epochal transition, are we seeing a new configuration of political and social power?”

Gordhan said history was essential to understanding society, but the challenge was to turn these insights into practice.

“What we learnt from Karl Marx is that philosophers interpret the world. However the point is to change it.”

When Gordhan became finance minister in 2009, much was made of his early affiliation to the SA Communist Party, but he said he was a no longer a member and had explored Marxism as a set of humanist values. - Sapa",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The Difference Between Botox and Dermal Fillers

Written by CG Cosmetic on February 19, 2015

CG Cosmetic understands the difficulties that come with aging. Everyone has days where they look in the mirror and are concerned with what they see. Whether or not you see deep lines and wrinkles, or fine lines, aging is inevitable. The question then, is what can you do about these signs of aging? Perhaps the most common solution people have heard of is Botox. However, Botox is not the only option. While CG Cosmetic offers Botox procedures, we also offer Dermal Fillers.

Botox

Most men and women have heard about celebrities using Botox to rejuvenate their skin and appear more youthful, but Botox isn’t just for celebrities. Botox has provided amazing and effective results that are also safe and convenient for many individuals. Facial lines and wrinkles often occur because of the way your muscles work underneath your skin. Overtime, as muscles tense due to making repeated facial expressions, your skin creates lines and wrinkles. Botox works by gently relaxing the muscles in your face, softening the wrinkles and leaving you with long-lasting smooth skin. CG Cosmetic patients have described their Botox experience as quick and painless, with most appointments taking less than one hour. Call to set up an appointment with our expert Botox specialist, Dr. Mayra Diaz, who has been in private practice for over 25 years.

Dermal Fillers

CG Cosmetic also specializes in Dermal Fillers. Different from Botox, dermal fillers work by lifting and plumping up skin, replacing collagen lost by the natural aging process. In addition to gently filling the skin, most dermal fillers also stimulate skin to encourage it to produce more collagen on its own. Dermal fillers are a great way to fix lines and wrinkles in the face, but they are also used for lip augmentations, creating fuller, plumper lips.

It is important to fully research all of your options for cosmetic surgery before making a decision about what is right for you. Start your research with a call to CG Cosmetic and talk to a specialist by scheduling a free consultation: 305-446-7277.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Nick Butler, Energy Commentator, Financial Times

Peter Atherton, Associate, Cornwall Energy

New Nuclear Watch Europe (NNWE) invites you to attend our upcoming Parliamentary Briefing on The future of nuclear energy in Europe following Brexit, due to be held in the House of Commons, London, on the 14 March 2017 at 16.00.

The event will focus on the opportunities and challenges facing the nuclear energy sector across Europe following Brexit. With the UK moving forward with a pipeline of new nuclear build projects, most recently with the CGN-EDF Hualong 1 application for GDA approval, this event will bring together leading policymakers, industry, academics and commentators to discuss how Europe can continue to be a global leader in nuclear energy development.

NNWE intends to promote discussion on the need for a Pan-European, or EU+, policy framework when discussing new nuclear build. With Brexit likely to occur in 2019, and the recent announcement that the UK will be pulling out of the Euratom Treaty, NNWE envisages the development of an Organisation for Nuclear Cooperation and Development in Europe, to continue and further enhance nuclear cooperation.

The latest EU PINC report highlights that 105GWe of new nuclear generation will be needed by 2050 – roughly 100 new reactors – to meet existing demand and climate change targets. However, only eighteen nuclear power plants are in development, planned, or proposed within the European Union itself. Whereas ninety-five reactors are planned throughout our EU neighbours – including Belarus, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and now the UK. NNWE believes an organisation is needed to drive the future of nuclear energy development across Europe and help us reach the ambitious 2050 target.

"Seven rare rhinos spotted in Indonesian jungle

In this undated photo released by Leuser International Foundation, a Sumatran rhino roams at Gunung Leuser National Park in Aceh province, Indonesia. A conservationist from the foundation said Thursday, Aug. 9, 2012 that seven of the world's rarest rhinoceroses were photographed at the national park. It is the first sighting there in 26 years. (AP Photo/Leuser International Foundation) NO SALES

Seven Sumatran rhinos have been captured on hidden cameras in an Indonesian national park where the critically endangered species was feared extinct, a conservationist said Thursday.

The Sumatran rhino had not been sighted in the Mount Leuser National Park on the northern tip of Sumatra for 26 years, the project's team leader Tarmizi of the Leuser International Foundation said.

""This discovery can allay doubts over the rhino's presence in the park,"" Tarmizi told AFP, adding he hoped the discovery would encourage more efforts to conserve the species.

Images of the rhinos were captured by 28 infrared cameras set up between June 2011 and April this year and confirmed six female and one male rhino appearing in 1,000 photo frames.

The Sumatran rhino population has dropped 50 percent over the past 20 years, and there are now believed to be fewer than 200 left in the world.

The rhinos are commonly targeted by poachers and rampant illegal logging has destroyed much of their habitat.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Spain is the EU country where most people live in apartments

Eurostat spends a good amount of money in
producing statistics about almost any activity within the EC and offers very valuable information about the construction industry. This time it has produced an array of figures about where the
European likes to live.

I am not one for statistics I must confess, but as
I have mentioned in many other articles we do obtain a lot of useful information especially for those of us involved in the construction industry.

Spain tops the ranking

According to the latest data from the European
Statistical Office (Eurostat), Spain tops the ranking of countries in the European Union (EU) where the highest percentage of population lives in an apartment: 66.5% of Spaniards live in this
type of building compared to 33.1% it does in a house. The figure is striking especially when compared with other neighbouring countries. In France, for example, the ratio is almost reversed:
seven out of 10 French lives in a house for three out of 10 in apartments.

The difference is even greater if we take the
number of UK, the country with the highest percentage of population living in households: 84.7% versus 14.4% living in a flat (0.9% of those interviewed answered with another category called
""other""). The closest country to Spain with apartments as the most widespread living accommodation is Latvia (65.1%), followed by Lithuania (58.4%) and Greece (56.9%), in that order.

The result of the average of the EU countries also
marks a clear dissimilarity with the Spanish context: six out of 10 Europeans live in a house opposite the remaining four does so in an apartment; more than 2.5 points of difference from the
Spanish proportion.

There are more home owners in Spain than in
other European countries.

Another interesting figure from Eurostat study on
the conditions and characteristics of housing in the EU is about ownership, all data shown here are obtained from 2014.

In this respect, nearly eight out of 10 Spaniards
(78.8%) own the property in which they live, 8.7% more than the European average. For rent they are somewhat below the average: 21.2% versus 29.9% for the European Community.

Why is the apartment so quintessential to the
Spanish people and why are they so prone to this property regime?

The reasons can be explained by three factors: the
historical, economic and sociological.

From inside the castle wall to the apartment
block.

Let’s start from the beginning. We have to roll
back to the turbulent middle ages, when wars determined the pattern of urban settlements. The cities were walled, the ground was very limited and already at that time housing needed to be built
in height. It was also the same in other countries, but in those countries wars did not last centuries as in Spain.

More recently, we had the rural exodus: Farmers
left the countryside and moved on to the city. In Spain this happened not long ago just in the decades of the 60’s to the 80’s. People migrated to cities and property developers sorted the
problem out with a quick construction method: the block of flats.

Today, vertical construction has been widely
accepted because it is greener and more resource-efficient.

Spain is an increasingly empty country where it is
increasingly easy to build horizontally. Still remember that, despite everything, the Spaniards hardly see the good side of an ecological construction and tend to seek the villas from a
prestigious point of view.

Property developers take control.

The role of the economy and the current situation
of crisis arising from the bursting of the housing bubble, are some of the explanations that make almost seven out of 10 Spaniards to live in apartments. There has been a very uneven economy and
there are the selected few who control the sale of development land. The property developer gets more economic benefit from building in height because they can make more profit.

A conservative family orientated
society.

The Spanish idiosyncrasies explain the property
ownership regime being most widespread among the Spanish people on one hand, and developments been built around the block of flats on the other.

The Spaniards are very conservative and fear and
loath financial investments. You only have to read recent news to see what happened to those who tried buying complicated financial products that they didn’t understand.

In general people have always seen the brick as a
solid long term investment, unlike financial products.

They are also conservative in its family
structure. There is less geographical mobility than other countries and historically people have bought a house because they did not anticipate moving for work reasons for a long time.

Having said that, due to the current crisis there
a good percentage of the working population ready to move anywhere, even abroad for a stable job position.

This has impacted directly on the sale of
properties, now the tendency has changed to rent.

However, figures for rental in this country still
far from European countries more oriented in that direction. As shown in Eurostat study, Germany with 52.5%, Austria with 57.2% and Denmark with 63.3%, are the countries where most people opt for
the lease in detriment of an ownership regime.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Guard youths from alcopops

OPINION

Attending any high school means you hear a lot about what everyone is doing - from after-school activities to alcohol. One of the major problems are alcopops - alcoholic drinks marketed toward youths that are easy to mistake as juice, soda or energy drinks because of their packaging and taste. I attend Asheville High School and work with Youth Empowered Solutions, a youth advocacy group that focuses on everything from youth obesity to substance abuse. We've worked before on labeling alcopops with stickers that remind adults not to purchase the products for youths and help distinguish the ...",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Review Transcript:
October is finally in full swing, giving us four (count them: FOUR) movies in one week, one of which is the latest in supernatural horror: Sinister. Truth be told, this is a pretty solid horror movie overall, and gives a fresh spin on the idea of “found footage” movies! It’s brought to us by the producer of Paranormal Activity and Insidious, but doesn’t suffer from some of the issues that both of these had.

Paranormal Activity suffered from being regarded as either incredibly boring or weird and somewhat tense until everything comes to a head at the end. Insidious on the other hand, had a very strong and refreshingly scary feel to it that took a major nosedive in the third act. Sinister manages to maintain a consistent tone to its horror that builds over time…you know, like a proper movie should. It never quite reaches the heights of terror that either movie achieved when at their best, but is a strong effort that’s overall enjoyable.

Of all the characters involved, the most intriguing is easily Ellison Oswalt, played by Ethan Hawke. He’s a true crime writer with a desire to write his best book ever, and the desire quickly turns to an obsession, as the last time he achieved fame was a decade ago with his first book. This obsession drives him to not only move to the same town where the grisly deaths of a family occurred, but into their house where they were murdered!

Now it’s obvious that Sinister is a horror movie, but…the first act of the movie could very well be the first act of a crime thriller along the same lines as Red Dragon (a great movie that should be seen if you haven’t already). This provides the audience a good portrayal of the mental and physical toll that the story takes on Ellison, as well as the family dynamics and how his obsessions affect his wife and children.

Although a successfully scary film, there are two issues that were hard for me to ignore. The first is that the actors playing Ellison’s children, Ashley and Trevor, were less than impressive. It’s no surprise for kid actors to not give great performances, but the daughter’s deadpan performance was incredibly distracting. Then again, my disappointment could be from comparing these kids to Pierce Gagnon, the kid from Looper.

The second and most jarring issue is Sinister’s reliance upon loud music and sounds for many of its scares, like Insidious. Or as my friend the Film Phage put it: “LOUD NOISES!” Despite the annoyingly influential LOUD NOISES…*ahem*…despite the annoyingly influential loud noises and music however, these elements are used in a way that lead to an effectively creepy and unnerving movie. Sure it’s a manipulative tool, but a tool that is used really well.

While Sinister may let down horror purists by relying too much on occasional jump-scares and way too many LOUD NOISES, it is a horror movie that most audiences will enjoy. It will legitimately scare, or at the very least creep out many viewers, while some might leave the theater terrified.

I give Sinister: 8/10.

"Oh, Boo-Hoo, Hillary

But Hillary’s is not the caricatured, bitchy, ball-breaking toughness that their enemies like to attribute to her. She has almost always been much more thoughtful than they granted. It is more like a kind of military rigor: reading the landscape, seeing the obstacles, recognizing which ones are malevolent or malign, and taking expedient action accordingly.

Whatever, Skippy. We know better and socialists/communists have you all afoul.

Pay Per Click Advertising Company Calgary

Calgary PPC

Launching a new business? Looking to generate more? Pay Per Click advertising is an excellent way of driving business your way almost immediately.

As the internet evolves, it is taking a larger role in our daily lives. With every passing day, we find ourselves spending more and more time in front of a computer screen. Advertisers are constantly looking for new ways to reach their potential clients. More and more of them are finding online advertising as a good tool of reaching their goals. Pay Per Click is an online advertising tool designed so advertisers can target their potential clients while those are using the search engine to find what they need. The system works by providing the advertisers with a set of tools designed to help them create their advertising campaign. The ads are displayed on a designated area called ""sponsored links"" in the search engine pages; those areas usually occupy the top and right side of your screen while on the search engine.

Compared with conventional advertising, Pay Per Click (PPC) is very effective targeting specific audiences, unlike many other advertising channels, it also provide a reliable way of measuring advertising effectiveness. By using Pay Per Click advertising, one can target clients based on specific keywords, and keyword combinations used to perform searches online.

The leading search engines with a Pay Per Click advertising program include: Google, Yahoo and MSN.

Target Your Audience More Accurately

Traditional advertising is designed for maximum exposure while hoping to get a response from a portion of the audience who the advertising is relevant for. With Pay Per Click, the advertiser targets it's specific audience based on keywords and keyword combinations. The advertiser's ads will only be displayed to people who searched for keywords selected by the advertiser. E.g. a pizzeria owner serving the Calgary area can set his Pay Per Click campaign so his ads will only be displayed for users searching for ""Pizza"" or/and ""Calgary pizza"". His ads will be viewed only by individuals searching for those exact terms and no one else. Traditional advertising can not offer that type of accurate targeting.

Measure Your Success by Pay Per Click Advertising Service

Pay Per Click advertisers can see exactly which keywords sent visitors to their site. Knowing which keywords are working for them and which are not can not only help them tweak their advertising, it can also provide them with valuable information that can help them adjust their business strategy and maybe consider offering new services based on market trends. Traditional advertising does not come close.

Target Your Clients Based On Geographical Location

Why advertise to a large audience when you can target your clients based on their location. Select multiple locations and change your setting at any time to test the response from new locations.

They told me, ""Dan write a Bio!"".... Now who wants to talk about themselves?

Well here goes: I remember being about 4 or 5 and sitting on a bench in front of a store with my older sister Karen. Picture a towheaded kid wearing one of his 4 older brothers stained, hand-me down red and white stripped shirts, with a hole over the belly button area, sporting worn cut-off shorts and a tattered pair of J.C. Penny tennis shoes, with convenient air holes for my toes to stick out. Shabby would be too kind of a word. My Sis tells it this way: Danny, you said, "" Sis, someday I'm gonna be able to buy my own clothes, not hand me downs!"" That was followed up with, ""I'm gonna be rich Sis.... You just watch!"" Its all vague now but she swears by it. Somehow, someway, I ended up doing something that I have a passion for and now over 40 years later, that passion still resides where the little determined boy once ruled my thoughts. I have been blessed with more than I ever deserved. I am rich in spirit, health and family. God has been good to that little boy from long ago, enabling me to do something I love. I am amazed and thankful every day.

Fast forward a few years and envision a teenage boy in El Paso who is intent on buying 4 acres of land in Chaparral, New Mexico, on a note for $14,000. I told my family it was going to be worth much more soon. They thought I was crazy and had no business buying some land. My friends were making payments on their used Chevy Camero's, Monte Carlo's, Ford Pinto's or even 4 x 4 Ford pickup trucks, I wanted to invest in buying land. I knew it was going to go up in value soon. It did, I resold it for $19,000 just 5 months later. I was hooked and I think I even bought a new pair of shoes! That was a start of many transactions. Now, after helping over 7000 families buy or sell homes across Texas, that fire still burns deep inside me. I always have had a feeling that everything will work out! It really does when you think about it. For some reason optimism followed me like the wind, always there whispering that I could do it. You see, just as that little kid of long ago or that teenage boy full of dreams believed anything was possible, I still think I'm going to win.

From those early days till now, I have been privileged and honored to have had a chance to help so many people with their real estate buying or selling needs. We have a super talented and dedicated staff to help people and without them, and of course, Tracy my wife, it would not be possible to have closed over 500 million dollars of sales in the past few years. We keep things simple. We offer, ""Over the Top,"" service to our clients and that has been a recipe for success for us. We are truly a full service real estate office. We now even have been entrusted with government contracts from HUD, the US Marshals office, the US Attorney Generals office as well as close ties with hedge fund groups.

As our client, you will receive the best we have to offer in personal service, knowledge of the current real estate market statistics, upcoming trends, home values, and expert negotiation skills. We also guide you through every step of the home buying/selling process so you will never feel alone. When you hire us, we come to work for you and will bring along years of experience and sage advice.

To quote one of my favorite speakers, Zig Zieglar, ""You will get everything you want in life as long as you help everyone get what they want!'

Thanks for reading this and taking a look at what we are about. I thank God for what he has done for me.

Kinstone Recreational Path

Side trail that leads to others

It seems to me this should have been called the Hononegah Trail given it passes through the forest preserve and etches the road with the same name. Anyways, the far east part of this path stems off of the Old Bridge Trail which is a great place to bike. When you come off that trail and onto the Kinstone, you go through a small forested area before heading up a hill that starts you along Hononegah Rd. The trail is asphalt/cement and is in pretty good shape. As mentioned, it goes through the front section of the Hononegah FP where they have a bathroom, picnic tables and a water pump all near the trail. The trail ends just east of downtown Rockton but another path picks up that takes you past the Rock River and the downtown area.
There aren't many bells and whistles along this short path but it is a nice continuation to other trails in the area.

Stone Bridge Trail

Continue the Long Prairie Trail

A month or so ago I rode the full length of the Long Prairie Trail. When I reached the Ronald Olson FP I realized that the trail continued as the Stone Bridge Trail. Having liked the Long Prairie Trail I marked the path for a future visit. That didn't take long, I was back a month later and ready to tackle the Stone Bridge and four other paths in the area with my son.
The Stone Bridge Trail is a very well kept limestone trail that only spans about 6 miles. Although short it features areas where you are in a gorge, then on a steep hill. In the middle you can get a history lesson by demounting and walking down the hill at the Stone Bridge site. At the base of the hill you can see the preserved site and read about its historic value.
At the northern base of the trail you can see where the train track line continues north. I sincerely hope they turn this into more biking trail that heads into Wisconsin.

Waterfall Glen

great ride

We rode the main trail and explored a few trails leading off the main trail on our mountain bikes. The only complaint is the lack of water. We are going back in a couple of days to do two loops and try more side trails. We will bring a cooler with our supplies

Pecatonica Prairie Trail

On the decline

I've used this trail for years. The past couple have seen serious decline in the trail's condition. It once was nicely and evenly packed with crushed gravel as recent as three years ago, but now most of it has been overtaken by grass and heavy rains have washed out parts of it. It's still passable on mountain bikes and fat tire bikes, but that's about it. I'm not sure why it has stopped being maintained but at the current rate, in another year or two nature will take it back completely.

Fermilab Trail

Good ride, Kirk Road is a mess

We came thru off of Batavia Rd and was an easy no traffic ride. Easy loop back to Prairie Path Trail.
Headed north on Kirk and is under construction and west side bike trail is terrible going up to Faybian Pkwy.

Fox River Trail (IL)

Oswego to Algonquin and back

We’ve spent many hours on this trail since we started riding a tandem two and a half years ago. We live close the Virgil Gilman trail in Sugar Grove and have spent most of our time on the southern half of the Fox River trail north and south of its junction with the Gilman Trail. The Fox River Trail also connects with the Illinois Prairie Path and its spurs as you venture north of Aurora through Elgin.

Six weeks or so ago we decided that we would try to ride the entire length of the trail and back. We spent the last couple of weeks on the northern section of the trail making sure that we knew our way through the northern half which has a few sections that go around short breaks in the paved trail such as north of State Street in South Elgin and heading south into South Elgin where the trail meets Raymond Street, there is also a junction to the Elgin spur of the Prairie Path. If you cross Raymond Street, you’ll be on the Prairie Path which you can use to go around South Elgin. To stay on the Fox River Trail, do not cross Raymond – go around the corner to the right. Each of these practice runs also included the hilliest section of the trail between South Elgin and Batavia. Tandems are crazy fast downhill due to the mass and aerodynamics but riding up long hills takes a special kind of love!

Yes, the trail can be busy around the towns; especially on weekends. The same reasons we are attracted to this trail also brings out the people walking and families. We thought doing our end to end ride would be better on a Friday but there were a surprising number of folks enjoying the beautiful day with us. We’re just patient with passing and give a thank you as we go by. More so than some other trails, there are many surface crossings so this trail will not boost your average speed, but we find these limitations to be a reasonable trade-off for this well-maintained trail.

The ride yesterday was generally incident free and went according to plan and was our longest ride to date on the tandem. We started out with a rear derailleur skipping issue which was very annoying (you shift more on a tandem than a single) but a quick adjustment at our first rest stop and all was well. The only other issue was a bridge replacement over Poplar Creek just north of South Elgin. Last Sunday there was no sign of construction, but we approached yesterday to find the trail closed. We checked it out to find that the old bridge had been removed but the new one was not yet installed. Fortunately, we found an unofficial detour and continued. Southbound, there was a sign that indicated the trail would be closed through the end of the month.

Cal-Sag Trail

Beautiful trail, no street crossings!!

Loved exploring this trail today! A bit hillier than Prairie or Salt Creek but nice rolling up and down both ways. We easily found Sag Quaries with Google Maps off of 83 and jumped right on. Couldn't believe no street crossings all the way to Nicks BBQ at the end of the trail! We stopped for lunch than headed back. Nice 24 miles! Loved the Lake Katherine area and the low traffic on this trail! We'll do it again in the fall as the foliage will be beautiful!

Danada and Herrick Lake Regional Trail

Herrick Lake - A Little Gem in Western DuPage County

I am embarrassed to admit that I have lived in the area for 20+ years and have driven by this little gem more times than I can remember. It is gorgeous!! I took my bike and was amazed at the number of trails and how large the area is. I went on a weekday afternoon so while many people were there walking their dogs or just enjoying the solitude, it never felt crowded. There were many stretches where I was completely alone and had the trail to myself. The parking lot of the Herrick Road entrance can accommodate many cars. It's a great oasis in the Western suburbs and I can't wait to go back!!

Prairie Trail (IL)

Awesome Path!

August 7th. Almost a perfect summer day and definitely perfect for a ride. Did a 30 mile round tripper from just south of Wisconsin line to south of McHenry and back. Condition of trail for that portion was about the best I've ever seen on any trail. Highly recommend parking at the trailhead for the Hebron Trail off Keystone Road at the north end of the trail. Hebron Trail will then take you straight east to hook up with Prairie Trail where you can begin and head south. No problems, well maintained all the way. Passes through several small, medium sized towns on this stretch with McHenry being the biggest. Plenty of access to services, food, water if you need it. Plan is to continue from McHenry on down south for my next leg of this trail. Can't wait to see what's ahead.

Baumann Park Recreation Path

Very Nice

Fox River Trail (IL)

Best sights of any bike trail!

This bike trail has the best sights of any! In Batavia you have the huge windmill, Fabyan Japanese gardens, and trolley museum. Pretty wildflowers as you go through Saint Charles and pass Camp Kane. The train museum in St Charles is neat as well as the collection of signals with the Woodcliff sign, then once you get to Elgin you can see a little castle off the path, Pratt's castle! I don't think any other path has as cool sights as this one.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"is needed. Air conditioners are rated according to
energy output, measured
in BTUs. Simply put, the
larger the room, the more
energy output required.
One more important
point: Modern equipment is more energy efficient than older models.
New Energy Star–rated

Hot tips for not needed.

Smart usage tips
Once you have the

keeping cool right air conditioner in
place, AHAM suggests
following these tips to
optimize performance.

• Turn off the unit and open doors and
windows during cooler periods.

• Use the unit fan and portable fans to draw
in cooler outside air and increase circulation.

• Use a dehumidifier in the basement to
prevent excess moisture seepage through
the house.

• Use a higher (warmer) thermostat setting during peak periods or when the area is
unoccupied. A 75- to 80-degree setting will
cut power consumption by 15 percent.

• Don’t let heat build up all day and then
try to cool areas quickly. Start units earlier in
the day and cool areas slowly before they are
occupied.

• Avoid activities that generate high heat
and humidity (such as cooking, bathing and
laundering) during high-heat hours.

• Draw shades or window blinds to reduce
solar and outdoor heat. Reflecting and dou-ble-pane glass, awnings, overhangs, louvered
sunscreens, plantings, fences or an adjoining
building also help—but don’t block the back
of the air-conditioning unit.

• Regularly change or clean filters and
check airflow for blockage or frost on the
evaporator coil.

• Have the air conditioner checked and
cleaned at the start of the season. During the
off-season, make certain it is cleaned and properly covered and disconnected.—Tim Talevich

KEEPING COOL in your home or business
in the summer months can roast your energy
bill. But taking energy-smart steps can help
keep air-conditioning costs as low as possible.

The two keys are buying the proper air
conditioner and running it properly. Here’s
a primer.

Buying the right air conditioner

It’s easy to understand how an undersized
air conditioner won’t properly cool a room.
Units that are too small simply aren’t strong
enough to cover a large room. However, an
equally common mistake is having an air
conditioner that is too large.

Air conditioners remove both heat and
humidity from the air, explains Energy Star, a
federal government organization that promotes energy-efficient products and practices. “If the unit is too large, it will cool the
room quickly, but only remove some of the
humidity. This leaves the room with a damp,
clammy feeling. A properly sized unit will
remove humidity effectively as it cools.”

Determining the right size of an air conditioner involves calculating room size and
other factors. Energy Star offers a basic chart
to calculate these figures on its Web site at
www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=roomac.pr_
properly_sized. But a more detailed calculator
is offered by the Association of Home
Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) at its site,
www.cooloff.org. This program asks for information on which region you live in, whether
the room has windows (and which direction
they face), what’s above the room and so on.

Either way, once you establish room size,
you can determine what size air conditioner

• EnergyStar certified for high energy efficiency

• Electronic controls (including remote control)

• High power cooling and low noise operation

• Washable air purifying filter (anti-bacteria filter)

• Effective dehumidifying operation

• Indoor temperature sensing thermostat

• Energy saving switch

• 24-hour On/Off timer

• Window kit for easy installation

"2007 to be hottest year ever, says Met Office

The UK's Meteorological Office predicts that 2007 will be the hottest on record, due to a combination of global warming and the El Niño weather phenomenon, Reuters reports.

This year will, the Met Office and prediction partner the University of East Anglia say, top the current record set in 1998. 2006, meanwhile, currently lies sixth in the all-time hottest years globally chart. All ten of the hottest years during the last 150 (when records began) have occured since 1994, the UN's weather agency adds.

Specifically, the upshot is that the world's average temperature in 2007 will be ""0.54 degrees Celsius above the 1961-1990 long-term average of 14.0 degrees"". 1998 clocked up 0.52 degrees above said average.

Met office scientist Katie Hopkins said: ""This new information represents another warning that climate change is happening around the world.""

The long-term prognosis is alarming. As Reuters puts it: ""Most scientists agree that temperatures will rise by between two and six degrees Celsius this century due mainly to carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels for power and transport."" ®",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

On the surface at least, with high economic growth and a dominant position within Europe, everything seemed to be going well for the German ruling class. However, this stability is turning into its opposite.

On Sunday, 14 January 2018, tens-of-thousands of activists from different labour and left-wing organisations came to the Berlin Socialist Memorial Cemetery in the Eastern suburb of Friedrichsfelde to commemorate the murder of the outstanding German revolutionaries and Marxists Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht on 15 January 1919.

Early on Monday morning, 20 November, the leaders of the German, right-wing, liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) suddenly declared their exit from preliminary coalition talks and walked out of the room. The negotiations with Chancellor Angela Merkel`s Christian Democrats and their Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU) and the Greens had been going on for nearly five weeks.

A political earthquake is the best way we can describe the federal elections that took place in Germany on Sunday, September 24. For the first time ever in post-war history an extreme right-wing party has been elected to the Bundestag (federal parliament). At the same time the parties that formed the “Grand Coalition” lead by Chancellor Angela Merkel since 2003 have suffered historic defeats.

On Monday, a truck ploughing through a crowded Christmas market at Breitscheidplatz in Berlin highlighted once again the mess that has been created in the Middle East by imperialist meddling. Twelve victims are believed to have been killed while 49 have been injured. The perpetrator of this crime had hijacked the truck from a Polish driver whom he subsequently killed. After the attack, he fled the scene and is still unaccounted for.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Work Would be Great Without the Coworkers

The French philosopher Jean-Paul Satre once famously said, “Hell is other people.” I’m not sure who poor old (unfortunate) Jean-Paul’s neighbors, friends, or coworkers (people who work at the same place you do) were, but obviously they were not exactly ideal (perfect; the best possible).

There’s no question (no doubt) that getting along with other people can be difficult, especially when you are at your job. A recent article tried to look on the bright side (focus on the positive) of bothersome (causing trouble) coworkers and suggest ways that these types of people can actually be helpful. I’m not sure if I’m buying that argument (am convinced; agree), but I thought I’d talk about a few common terms used for these difficult types of coworkers in the U.S. Perhaps you know someone who fits (is similar to) one of these descriptions:

A social butterfly is a person who likes to talk a lot, be around other people, attend parties and other social events, and meet and know a lot of people.

A gossip is someone who likes to talk about other people, even if what he says isn’t true. You can have a social butterfly who just likes to chat (talk informally), but who may also be a gossip.

A workaholic is someone who works too much, and is always thinking about work, even when not working.

Malcontents are people who are generally unhappy and who may find ways to do things they are not supposed to do, or may express their unhappiness in other ways.

Someone who is passive-aggressive is someone who shows her unhappiness in small ways, rather than confronting (meeting face-to-face or openly) the person who is making her unhappy. A passive-aggressive person might misplace (lose temporarily) important papers, not return your phone calls, or “forget” to do the things she promised to do for you. So, it’s possible for someone to be a malcontent who is passive-aggressive. Even worse, this person could be a workaholic who is a passive-aggressive malcontent!

A narcissist is someone who believes everything should be focused on him or her, believing his or her own ideas, views, and beliefs are the most important. A person who is a narcissist might attract people who are suck-ups.

A suck-up is willing to say or do things — such as compliment someone a lot or say how great he is — to get an advantage in the workplace.

Backstabbers are people who pretend to be friendly with you, but make critical (disapproving) comments or do things to harm you when you’re not around.

Who do you think are the most disruptive (interfere with your work or cause the most problems) where you work: social butterflies, gossips, workaholics, narcissists, malcontents, suck-ups, backstabbers, or passive-aggressive people?

26 Responses to Work Would be Great Without the Coworkers

There are these kind of jewelleries every place you could be working and every one of them are really a good piece
to be off from them if it could be possible but some time it is not.
I think one of the most disruptive could be the passive-agressive that usually is also adorn with other virtues like
gossip and suck-up.

Working in a large place for years, being with dozens of chaps and women every day I have met every kind of these
jewelleries inside the office, but what is even worst could be that this kind of people usually have the hability of
going up from their position and get what they really want just to be a boss because in fact they cannot do another
thing as gossip, suck-up, or backstabber.
The common rule should be that fair workers or persons don´t get anything more than too much work every moment.

My best dear Jeff, you are a fair good worker without any of these attributes that you have mentioned above, that´s for sure.

A piece of paper, a line, at the right side all the negative things about a subject, a place, a decision, a trip, or which ever other matter
you need to think on.
On the right side all the positive things of the same subject, decision or question.

Read all carefully, think on all the negative and the positive things about the matter you need to have a resolution and act accordingly
with the result, or not, but you already know the PROS AND CONTRAS ( in Spanish) of the subject.

I have done that execise several times along my life, but never about a person, I love or want the person or not, to me that is enough.

Cuca an me are watching a new TV serial “Breaking Bad” (one of the best I could remember) and on the second or third episode the
protagonist take a paper and make a list that way. It could be one of the few occasions I have watched that on the TV., he has taken
a man he thinks wants to kill him, he cannot advise the police and have to decide if he kill the man or not, so take a paper and write
all the negative and the positive things of taken his resolution.

I am not going to tell you the end, see the serial that is incredible good.

I love what Cuca tells us about the themes or stories that she has, itself, to make life easier, sleep, do not think about their future, not thinking about their disease, multiple sclerosis , that have no cure.
Ultimately we could all, we know that we must die soon, today, tomorrow, or in a few years. Get sick if we are healthy, and if we ailments, with more reason to live today the present.
Cuca gives us a practical example of our destructive thoughts away and have incentives to entertain our intellect.
She tells us nice or comical real stories of the men and women who were living hundred of years ago and all of them are so interesting that have a great success
in the “gatufo´s blog”, till the point some time emiliano/gatufo. is jealous with her exit.

(it could be good to put some of them here in the ESL blog with Jeff´s permiss that sure he gives me)

Second and most important point, reflect on what we are humans.
Yes, the second point to ponder here is much more difficult and painful than the first.

What happens to human beings? No second day someone dies not massacred, murdered, raped, by one or more other human beings.
Humans beings themselves massacred by fellow like them.

The other living things of this world kill to eat, or to survive, we kill us humans?
Which purpose or we have in our minds to assassinate each other. To crush the weak, the innocent, invent the worst destructive weapons imaginable.
Was started with a stone, a stick, a jawbone of an ox or lamb, and so have been used increasingly, knives, swords, spears, arrows, maces, fire, stones, boiling oil, rifles, guns, planes, missiles and even gas mass murder our neighbors.

It is a malignant virus that is within our existence that makes us so aggressive, violent, butchers, with ourselves and our neighbors?
It is said that God made us in his image and likeness, that mystery is to doubt amazing and frankly, can not be that the image or likeness of God, the supreme being all goodness, you can be the man throughout his existence. Evil, murders, wars, famine and so continue.
Humans never learn?

Goodness is inside the human soul, of course, thankfully, but there are many doses of evil, violence, mindless aggression leads to kill our neighbors that we do not know, that finally, since such an attitude leads repeatedly million times, today, yesterday, and thousands of years before.

We have the gift of speech but not talk to our neighbors, our brothers, we can write and we do not, we can reason and not reason. Simply kill to impose our criteria, for fun, for amusement, for simple and clear evil. And most of the time by ambition, power and money.
We forget that we die, sooner than later, and to live well and in peace treasure not need wealth, power and hatred.

The world is plunged into extreme violence of the human race, as always, destroys itself and other living things, as long as all this for what purpose? I myself look inside myself and I know I can be violent in other circumstances, in other religious or dictatorial environments. Nobody can understand what is happening today, yesterday, or tomorrow. We’ll finish everything that exists? Could be.

I have no explanation for this, nobody does, extreme good and evil that is the human being. Good Samaritan, good father, good mother, and cruel murderer simultaneously if need be.

Who can understand?

More to the questions “to be or not to be that is the question” or “who I am, where I come to where I’m going”, we might think that we do so much damage to our neighbors and ourselves, while we are charitable, solidarity patients.

Frankly it is very difficult to understand ourselves.

But life, death, kindness, sadism and violence continue today in any part of the globe, and particularly in certain areas called “hot” of a lifetime. They fight, they kill, die innocent and this continues more.
Happen as usual, about the last years in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, Lebanon, and many other countries.

Well, frequently I think on these subjects, but what could be done?
Humans are what they are along history, destroy everything they touch but even kill their humans brother without reason and any profit to their souls or
the kind of life it is supposed to have.

History follows always in the same way, the world if full with last examples of wars, destructions and pain.

I tend to agree with your title “Work Would be Great Without the Coworkers”, especially if we have to spend time together with Backstabbers, gossip, malcontents, narcissist, passive-aggressive, social butterfly, suck-up and workaholic.

In fact, these kinds of people don’t just exist in our work place, they are everywhere – at home, at work, even a stranger like a sales person could suddenly tells you how horrible her mother-in-law is.

There is a saying in Hong Kong: one type of rice feeds hundred types of people. We are all different. I would try to avoid those people who are bothersome.

I would like to thank you again Jeff for using this opportunity to teach us more special terms to describe those kinds of people. It is useful to know the use of them.

I believe that the best way to get along with the people of these categories is to know their inner world and expectations. Let me clarify my point.
A social butterfly is a good mixer who mingles with people easily. Consequently, he can give good advice on how to throw parties, prepare brilliant speeches and do presentations. If I, for example, ask for his wise tips, he will definitely wish to help me because he is an expert in this field. As a result, we will establish a steady long-term relation. By asking for his wise advice, I will boost his self-confidence and self-esteem. In return, I will improve my communication skills. It’s a win-win situation.

Moving on to a Gossip, he knows much about the coworkers, their problems and strong and weak points. If I want, for instance, to resolve a conflict with someone or clarify misunderstanding then I can come up to the gossip and ask everything about the person I am about to talk to. After hearing him out, I will be able to set the best strategy to tackle some problems. Besides, I can ask the gossip to get some important information about somebody for me. I bet the gossip will be glad to reveal his true talent. Again, it’s a win-win situation.

If a Malcontent bothers you, then you can download a video on crippled and mentally ill people from YouTube who are looking for some sponsors. Explain to him that these people are more miserable than him and need his help. Then, ask him to make a donation or provide them with any possible help. Next, always ask him whether he has done it or not. He will end up contacting you. If it doesn’t work, you can say that there is always some stink coming out of his mouth. He should see the doctor ASAP. Eventually, you will get rid of him.

Keep a distance from Backstabbers. Keep your conversations with him to the minimum. The less he knows about you the less vulnerable you are.

If you have to deal with narcissist, a few penny compliments will make him happy. Highlight his importance in the company and point at his unique approach to tackling various problems. Don’t overdo, of course. Otherwise, you will be considered as a Suck-up.

Jeff’s post provoked so many thoughts that I am writing again. I do not see any problem with that. There is so many white space just waiting to be filled.

I am trying to looking at the picture from a different side here.

With these individuals it is not all pain and negativity, they also make the world different, less boring and various. So, I am pleased with their presence.

Just as an example, without them, there would not be this same post! we would be here complaining about how perfect we are.

I do not want to work in a place that looks like the covers of the Jehovah’s witness publications of paradise on earth where you see everyone smiling
and the kids play with lions.

Maybe that yes, I mean playing with lions, I would like that.

So, I am glad there are such individuals around. Personally, at the workplace I experience lots of fun.
We are all relatively young and there is abundance of joking around and jerks to make fun of.

Answering Jeff’s question, I would say that the most disruptive person is the woman that instead of working goes b@#£@ing around.
I could be wrong about that, but geez …women can be disruptive just like hurricanes. Don’t you guys agree?

Hi! I like the psychological topic even if I always have a guiltiness feeling.
I think we all are a little narcissist, a little gossip, a little backstabber. This is the human nature.
I look at the little children. They don’t know to lie and their parents must teach them not to have bad manners with their mates, having a good bahaviour.
Because of many troubles, failures from our own life we can harm work place life or even productivity.
We start to envy, to hate anyone, especially the success persons.
Or simply, we were born with these “manners”.

Hi! With regard to the bosses…I agree with the mentioned article.
“The narcissists are terrible listeners and apt to gobble up all the credit.
Many bosses are narcissists. Take care ensuring that the narcissist doesn’t rule your work life.”
One of my bosses was very gossip, backstabber, very, very narcissist, but workaholic and clever.
We have sometimes to tolerate some “sins”, if it is possible.

Hi! Dear Neal, you are a new comer I think. Glad to meet you.
Thank you for your very good advices.
For sure you are talking from a boss view point.
A good boss must know to use all his employees abilities and “sins” for his profit.
And I agree with you: the less he knows about you the less vulnerable you are.
This was one of the first advices received when I started to work:
don’t talk too much about you.
Thank you.

Hi! Dear Emiliano, I am reading with interest every thing you are writing.
I was worried about you said: around February/ March I began to regain my life again.
I’m not really a believer but I pray to God when I lose hope.
I do the same, too.
I wish you all the best.

Hi! Work would be great without the coworkers… I don’t know what to say…
I have had the oportunity to work alone in an office.
It was quiet, pleasant, but I was isolated from the rest of the coworkers.
As I am a lonely person, being and isolated…you can imagine how nice it was.

Neal, my eyes are opening wide reading your post as it is wise, absolutely wise and certain. I think you have given us such good advises
that I can only said you ¡BRAVO¡ they are really nice and incredible wise advises what you have written in the post.
Reminds me what my wife Cuca use to do in her common life, she is really an intelligent wise person just in living without problems with
other, family or wich eve other person who could be beside her.
I am not so, I am a fighting man that says just what me have not to say being so frank and crude (some times) that seems I am looking
for problems every where or moment.

To persons like you and Cuca I only could say, Bravo, that is the right attitude to be happier, Neal sincerely yours
emiliano.

A stimulating issue,I guess.After reading this,some kind of faces,faces of my coworkers, have come out of my mind immediately.
some of them are more or less like Jeff said.And it seems to me that a suck-up may disturb me a lot,which could be called ‘friendly-looking tiger’
in China,I guess.
But there is a saying in my country,all rivers run into sea because it has wide heart and is capable of embracing all.We are not sea though,we could
still learn to sea and try our best not to be influenced by those kind of persons.
Anyway,I guess we are not perfect as well and we sometimes are more or less like them.
So thinking of more positive sides of people would do good to all of us.

Dear Tania, I don´t know if these poems have been here in this land of peace before
but again they are here, just for you dear friend.

My Love

Without wanted, without feeling it nearly without being concious
I fell in love.
Thin, nice, beautiful crazy girl, we were living the sixties.
Deluded years from one generation that confused everything.
Love, miracle daily bright that enlight my entire life.
After fourty years or more of living, without feeling them being together.
Today I still fell in love with you once and again till I´ll die.

Depression

I am not the same I felt yesterday.
Changed without knowing why?
It is today what let me empty?

Ideas come and go without any sense
Thoughts incessant that drill the head
Not hopes only awaiting everything go by

Be you I say, but so another day
Going after chimeras that vanish
There is not any sense or hopes just wait

One and another day, waiting for what
Dead without doubts, easy relax for ever
Sleep, not to think, not to suffer, not await

Sleep for ever, at the end rest perhaps?
Who knows? life it is a not sense being so
when there is not will to continue

Only rest is the time, today only rest is my will.

Yes, they are quite different, but some time sadness gives a way of inspiration, don´t you think

"So, now that the Xoom has flopped, can we finally agree that ""tablet"" means ""iPad""?

Yeah, I don't see how the Android tablet makers are going to make money, Apple won't worry too much as people who want iPads are probably still going to buy iPads.

Amazon's only liability is that their business model limits the Fire's availability & distribution.... at least until they can make their way through the tangled labyrinth of international media rights.

If - or rather when - they do address that, I think they're going to commandeer the Android tablet market much in the way Samsung commandeered the Android smartphone market, if not more so. Between the Fire and W8/RT, Google-sanctioned Android on tablets may well find itself in a tough place.

I do think the new line of Fires put a lot more pricing pressure on Apple than last year. The Fires are more media-centric, but Whispersync for games + parental controls + a new bundled e-mail client make them a bit more competitive with iPads.

It's not the problems of printing that keeps the price high - but the publishers definitely introduce an artificial economy of scale. You really are better off with big orders, but it's almost completely artificial as a means to keep smaller publishers out. Breaking the big 3 is the key to opening up the textbook market.

Which is exactly what handing students a tablet does. Now what do the publishers do? Where' their ""hook""? They don't own the copyright to these things for the most part; the authors do.

The authors, in the majority of cases, would have nothing much preventing them from producing an eBook edition at whatever price benefitted them.

Looks like a classic ""cut out the middleman"" to me. And, not a few professors have always been chafing at the problems involved with getting their courses published, especially at the graduate school level. Not all of them are in it for the textbook money, to say the least.

State governments at the secondary school level are going to see the advantage here, big time, as well.

A lot of smaller states are chafing at the fact that places like Texas and California tend to limit what gets published.

But, with no real economy of scale problem anymore, it wouldn't be all that hard to do an end-run around these problems.

It wouldn't be totally easy or pretty at that level (the school would have to be willing to deal with the check-in and check-out of tablets and dealing with kids throwing them against walls -- though they have to do that with books as well).

The economics of this could get very interesting. Won't happen overnight, but the leverage alone might change the way textbooks work.

I foresee another little cosy empire to disrupt.

The problem is cost. WHo will be buying the tablets? Do they have to buy the textbooks each year for each student? A decent textbook can last for 10 years (or longer) for many subjects. That is a nice amortization. It could end up that if the school has to provide the tablet and the license each year for the book that it might end up costing more in the long run for ebooks.

Eldest wanted a Fire last year. He got a laptop instead. Now this year he's going to get a 16GB Fire HD 8.9 for Christmas. 1920*1200, HDMI out, HD Skype calls to grandma, kid friendly filtering so he can watch Prime streaming without the R rated stuff, no need to settle for the shitty Tegra 3 in the Nexus 7, $300.

Yeah, I don't see how the Android tablet makers are going to make money, Apple won't worry too much as people who want iPads are probably still going to buy iPads.

Except Samsung could lose it overnight really. nothing really holding them there. Amazon has price as their big thing, and Amazon content.

As for the professors, well, you're right, some do enjoy socking it to their students.

That's really a myth. Authors get relatively little per book. The main reason why instructors push their own textbooks is because they think it's the best out there and because publishing helps with career advancement. On a $100 textbook, the author will earn about $15. With a class of 100 students, that's probably 5% or so of what they'd earn teaching the course considering buybacks and so on. You can make real money as a textbook author, but you make your money when you become the standard text and are selling to all institutions. To one class won't make much difference and certainly doesn't cover the 2-4 years of time you invested writing the book.

The bigger problem is instructors that self-publish through the institution. That's quite common at for-profit institutions and many smaller schools. They'll create the course materials and then demand the students pay $100 for the photocopies after the course begins. They didn't earn enough on the course fees, so they made it all up on the material kickback. It was a big enough problem that Congress passed a law requiring education institutions that receive federal student aid to publish all course costs before student enroll. It remains a problem nevertheless.

Except Samsung could lose it overnight really. nothing really holding them there. Amazon has price as their big thing, and Amazon content.

Agreed. Amazon's lock-in goes much deeper. (Of course, Amazon isn't pulling in the billions that Samsung is. But I think I like their odds in the very long run better.)

Eh.

Apple doesn't make real money on content. Amazon can't either. Amazon is building a storefront for your lap. They want you to buy underwear with this thing, and their profit margin is on the Amazon Prime subscription you need to keep in order to make the device useful. This is the carrier model - they subsidize the hardware and you pay them $80/yr to use it. Once you're paying the $80, you might as well take advantage of the 2 day shipping and whatnot.

It's an odd model, but one that Amazon can pull off to some degree. But it's going to have limited success because it only works in the US and to a limited degree in Canada and the UK. In every other market Amazon has nothing. Even if Amazon can beat Apple and Google in the US, development of the competing products will advance unhindered because overseas sales dominate. Eventually Amazon is going to fall behind. And eventually Amazon has to make money here - they can't keep dividing up their profit margins as they are. And they're starting to lose their sales tax benefits - starting in a week they need to collect CA sales tax. That will immediately make my local stores the same price or cheaper than Amazon for most things.

But it's going to have limited success because it only works in the US and to a limited degree in Canada and the UK. In every other market Amazon has nothing.

What makes you think you can't expand, slowly, internationally? The new Fire is being rolled out in the U.K. offering a very similar ecosystem.

I strongly doubt Amazon is going to beat Apple. But they have a very good chance of being the biggest Android tablet vendor, by a long shot.

Personally I prefer the smaller device, the ipad is bulky and heavy, why follow that trend? 5 inches is too big for a phone.

Fixed that for ya there.

Comparing a 5"" phone to the ipad?

Remember, for the medication to work, you need to take it every day.

Please explain the difference between your objections to the iPad being too large and the objections of the people who said that 5 inches was too large for a phone. It should be enlightening.

Why would I be concerned about those who think 5"" is too large for a phone? My next phone will probably be a Note 2. If some people are happy settling for a 3.5"" screen that you have to squint at, then good news for Apple?

What makes you think you can't expand, slowly, internationally? The new Fire is being rolled out in the U.K. offering a very similar ecosystem.

Their model requires getting a LOT of pieces in place. It's really damn hard. There's a reason why only Apple has been able to pull it off so far. And if they they want the meatspace sales included, they have to work out shipping on top of everything else. So far, they've only expanded into markets where they were also expanding their meatspace business. That's why I think focusing exclusively on digital when assessing Amazon is a mistake. Clearly their traditional sales model remains their core model. The Fire isn't really an iPad killer - it's a retail bankruptcy machine. It's designed to some day let you snap a photo of something you see in the park, pull it up on Amazon, read the review, click the Buy Now button, and have it the next day. No need to visit the mall. Oh, and it streams movies and stuff too.

Amazon can't win the digital war. Apple can go loss leader there if need be, and Amazon doesn't control the consumer endpoint well enough. They're more integrated than they used to be, but not nearly well enough integrated to pay off. And if they're not careful, they'll piss off their dependent partners like Google did. I'm sure Amazon makes more money through their iOS originated sales than they do through sales on their own device. They can't afford to break that.

Bottom line, you need to make real money someplace. You can use that to subsidize other parts of your business, but you can't use low-margin divisions to subsidize no-margin divisions. That's basically what Amazon is doing. It's why they have a PE of 300. They're growing revenues but not profits, so I have no clue why investors keep rewarding them. There's no possibly way Amazon will ever grow profits to match that PE based on anything they're showing us now.

Hmm, not sure I agree. Amazon's model is wildly different than Apple's, and no way as profitable, but if they can capture a sizable portion of media that people purchase (and keep, in media libraries) with their DRM, I think there's a real opportunity for establishing critical mindshare and lock-in, ensuring revenue and profit (low-margin, but high volume, and all locked-in). Amazon *has* to succeed in digital, because so much of the media they sell will be displaced by digital formats.

Quote:

I doubt it too, but it's hard to compete with loss leaders.

Yeah, but Apple has supply-chain mastery and economies of scale that Amazon can't (so far) match, which makes the fight more equal. And Amazon can't compete with Apple in the software dept. The new Fires look like great media-centic tablets, but the iPad is so much more versatile. I can't imagine Fires establishing much of a foothold in education or enterprise.

Bottom line, you need to make real money someplace. You can use that to subsidize other parts of your business, but you can't use low-margin divisions to subsidize no-margin divisions. That's basically what Amazon is doing. It's why they have a PE of 300. They're growing revenues but not profits, so I have no clue why investors keep rewarding them. There's no possibly way Amazon will ever grow profits to match that PE based on anything they're showing us now.

Amazon's PE is just insane. I wouldn't go near their stock for that reason. It is very strange.

That said, I *think* Bezos' long-term vision is genius (or crazy? ). Capturing a significant chunk of the tablet and digital media market *now* has potential to pay great dividends in the future. The Fires, while at the moment may be no-margin (or perilously close), could become low- or even medium-margin products once Amazon hones their supply chain and can establish themselves as a standard. 'dunno, I could be wrong, but I think Amazon has something good going on, strategically.

The discussion lookmark and johnsonwax are having is what I find so puzzling about the Kindle strategy: the hardware is a loss leader at worst, break even at best. They can't be making a significant amount off digital content either as the lion's share of the money paid goes to content owners. So what is the goal of these devices?

I don't begrudge Amazon's process, especially since it benefits the consumer with good value and low cost products. But from a business point of view I find them intensely fascinating.

What makes you think you can't expand, slowly, internationally? The new Fire is being rolled out in the U.K. offering a very similar ecosystem.

Their model requires getting a LOT of pieces in place. It's really damn hard. There's a reason why only Apple has been able to pull it off so far. And if they they want the meatspace sales included, they have to work out shipping on top of everything else. So far, they've only expanded into markets where they were also expanding their meatspace business. That's why I think focusing exclusively on digital when assessing Amazon is a mistake. Clearly their traditional sales model remains their core model. The Fire isn't really an iPad killer - it's a retail bankruptcy machine. It's designed to some day let you snap a photo of something you see in the park, pull it up on Amazon, read the review, click the Buy Now button, and have it the next day. No need to visit the mall. Oh, and it streams movies and stuff too.

Quote:

I strongly doubt Amazon is going to beat Apple. But they have a very good chance of being the biggest Android tablet vendor, by a long shot.

Amazon can't win the digital war. Apple can go loss leader there if need be, and Amazon doesn't control the consumer endpoint well enough. They're more integrated than they used to be, but not nearly well enough integrated to pay off. And if they're not careful, they'll piss off their dependent partners like Google did. I'm sure Amazon makes more money through their iOS originated sales than they do through sales on their own device. They can't afford to break that.

New Fires (with the exception of the 8.9"" model) are apparently available in the U.K, France, Germany, Spain and Italy:

I think Bezos wants cool stuff; unlike Jobs, however, he doesn't actually care about the profit.

How he managed to sneak that buy stockholders I have no clue. It's a Ponzi scheme at that point where new customers generate the profit to pay for the investment to attract them, thereby creating new network effects to attract more future customers et al.

So long as the Internet grows, mail order distribution grows, and digital content grows, they are fine.

As soon as the market is mature and there are two retail giants, then the game is played by profit since it will be at that point a zero-sum game.

That's interesting - and a new development from Amazon. I wonder what services will be available in those countries?

App stores. Amazon own Lovefilm in the UK. Kindle books. MP3s. So some of the content.

Got to say as pleased as I am to see any Fire in the UK, I am itching to get a tablet, but I don't want one of the 7"" models now. The 8.9"" model is almost perfect. If anyone from Google is reading, please copy it and make it a Nexus.

I don't really think so. Not from what I see now. I can get the Amazon app for free on my Nexus tablet. And, I wonder if 50 dollars (the difference between the new Fire and the Nexus) is going to be that compelling if the only thing Amazon is really selling is a storefront. It needs to be more.

What does Amazon bring to the table as far as apps go? As far as services go? Will there be things like Google Earth? Will it get everything or even most things? How good will they be?

If I want Amazon right now, on my Nexus tablet, I simply install the app and I have the store front. And, I have everything else out there without fuss.

The only way Amazon really wins this game is that it gets a large stable of apps and services. In short, it has to move beyond the store front. Well past the store front. Will it really do so?

I wonder if this is some of the reason behind the fact that the original Fire, by all accounts, ran out of gas. Maybe it is a seasonal thing, like other books you buy at Christmas.

Or, maybe at around 200 bucks, a lot of people end up with both. My wife likes her Nook, but I ended up with a conventional Google tablet. At 200 bucks, I couldn't resist. But, the Fire, I could. Probably because it looked like just a bookstore to me. My wife already has that.

Heck I have access to her bookstore on my tablet, since she's willing to share her B&N account on it.

It's just not clear that I'm missing anything by not having the Nook or the Fire. I am reasonably assured at getting the whole tablet experience, whatever the heck that turns out to be.

Maybe I won't turn out to be typical, but this doesn't strike me as a very geeky line of thought. The question will probably boil down to how serious Amazon gets about being more than a storefront.

Because not everyone cares about gouging their customers. For some a few percentage points of margin are enough.

Aha: here is one catch. With the new Fires, no way to opt of Amazon's Special Offers on the lock screen. Kinda cheesy.

That's rather unfortunate. I don't live in the US, so the Fires are of limited interest to me aside from on a technical level. I do, however, have a huge mancrush on the e-ink Kindles and dislike ads enough to spring for the models without ads. I can only hope that removing the option to purchase an ad-free device doesn't spread to the e-ink models.

Their inclusion in the Kindle tablet devices suggests them using the revenue stream to make money over the long term. Clever idea really. They really are approaching these devices with more of a long term revenue model, womewhat similar to game consoles.

So ads ship enabled by default until you pay a fee to have them removed, that's interesting. Odd that they didn't just do it like the e-ink Kindles and make a SKU with no ads. Guess they're hoping many people won't opt out.

The question is, will consumers sell their soul to ad campaigns for 20 to 50 bucks a device?

I kind of hope this fails, because if it doesn't, then we're going to see ads on everything -- quite probably including iOS. Sooner or later, the lure of money will win. If you think Apple won't do that, well, there's this: http://arstechnica.com/staff/2012/08/op ... t-machine/

Well, so far that's one new guy at Apple, so let's not blow it up into a trend until we get at least a 2nd data point even within the retail arm. I agree it's troubling, but it's waaaay too early to panic.

That said, Apple's not going to put ads on iOS. They'll do ads as a way to monetize content - tv shows, music, etc. but not the devices themselves. Everything in Apple's last 15 years indicates they would profoundly oppose that. They didn't even ad ads to the iTMS back when they desperately needed the money. Yeah, I know Steve is gone, but Cook is as much at the heart of Apple's reinvention as Steve was.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Angry Angron: Converted Daemon Prince

Today's post is to showcase a commission that I have literally just finished: Angry Angron!

This has been quite a lot of work, and lots of techniques went into the finished model, so I've uploaded several pictures of the finished piece.

The model came to be already assembled, from a client in America, and was converted from (I think) a WFB giant, with Tyranid Hive Tyrant wings, and parts from a Chaos kit as well. The face and head were from a metal gorilla of some description - the overall model is quite heavy, but well-balanced on the base. I must say that I was impressed by the conversion work that went into this model!

This shot demonstrates the work on the wings. I wanted a ""bat-like"" wing membrane, so used several passes of light dry brushing alongside some thinned washes. The final pass was with just a touch of varnish, enough to give the membranes a leathery finish. I added mottling and small dots to some areas of the wings to add interest.

The shoulder pads were from an unknown soft plastic kit (perhaps an action figure!?!), and their positioning did conflict with the wings a little. I used Citadel metallics and washes, then highlighted up so that the gold/brass work really screams.

More mottling was done on the back, around the spines and hair.

This model also had a lot of skulls! This photo shows the skulls around the belt and groin.

The sword was my client's idea. I envisage that maybe it was once a noble, perhaps Imperial, weapon, but has been corrupted and degraded over time. I therefore went with a high silver finish, but ran blue and green washes into the blade. This gave a nice verdigris or patina effect. I finished it with Runefang chipping.

Another good view of the wings and back - the model was so big that it barely fit into my photo booth.

More skulls on the spines; Angron seems to have been busy...

A shot of the face - I went with simple ""human"" eyes, demonstrating the tragedy of this fallen primarch. Beneath all of the savagery and bloodshed, two human eyes peer from the body of a monster...

This photo shows the hands - they are mechanical, and I used weathering powders and washes to demonstrate their age. Rust pigment was brushed into the joints, then sealed with pigment fixer. (Excuse the balance on this shot: the brass looks very orange, whereas in real life it is much more like aged gold.)

So, that's Angron finished - hopefully my client will be pleased with him - and I move on to the next project: another squad of Blood Angels Centurions. I've actually been doing these alongside Angron, so they should be finished in the next few days...",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

I had a memory tonight, which is rather rare for me. My memories are few and far between. It was a sound that triggered the memory, one from forty years ago. The sound of a cat.

It was around this same time of year, when two young boys, one that I knew personally, were playing outside. They had just learned how to tie a noose. These two boys, for whatever reason, tied nooses on opposite ends of a rope, placed them around their necks and climbed a tree. Somehow, in the process of their playing, they fell across a tree branch and the rope wasn't long enough for them to get their legs under them, to get weight off the nooses.

After hearing of the tragedy, I was lying in bed, crying. This was back in the days of attic fans and open windows. Somewhere, out in the dark of night, a cat was crying out. The sound reminded me of a child, crying out for it's mother. It broke my heart, more than it was already broken.

Hearing that same sound tonight, brought back the memory. The memory of two young lives, cut short. After forty years, it still brought with it, a chill.

During the recent Blog Out, it gave me a tiny bit of comfort to know I wasn't suffering alone. Not sure if anyone else in blogland has been struggling with the new Xfinity business, but I certainly have. Surprisingly, there were only minor glitches and interruptions to my cable service. Phone and internet, on the other hand, have been a real nightmare. When I think back over the years, to all the hours I've spent on the phone... hours I will never get back... talking to people whose accents I struggled to understand, it makes me want to scream. Thinking about all the money we've paid them, for all the aggravation, doesn't make me a happy camper, either.

I THINK I'm up and running, again, for now. We'll see how long it lasts.

Special thanks to my oldest son, for running telephone interference for me. Hearing the land line ring, music to my ears. Having my internet working, wonderful. Two Advil for the headache... PRICELESS!

Just so this post isn't a total rant, I'm adding a recent picture of the ever growing, ever changing, ""Chunky Monkey"", fresh from a bath, smelling sweet.

Much to my surprise, Mother's Day went great. Considering we thought we might have to cancel our plans, since my mother in law went to the ER on Saturday evening, we were shocked we didn't have to spend the day at the hospital. She's fine, still a little weak, but otherwise ok. She's a pretty tough ol' lady. She can still run circles around me and she's old enough to be my mother! She's a force to be reckoned with... reckon I'll pass. I've suffered plenty of her butt kicking over the past 35 years. The target may be larger, but I try to keep it covered.

My sweet daughter helped me get the food in order. (Bless you!) We ate, chatted, I held the baby... lots, sat outside and sweltered, some had after dinner coffee, some had wine. The baby had liquid gold, (breast milk) which he shared with me, (reflux) several times. He's very generous that way. I tried to convince him I didn't need it, to keep it for himself. No way, he insisted on sharing. Shares with anyone close. He shared a couple of other things, too, I'll spare you the details, but... I swear I was careful and didn't pinch ANYTHING.A little later, with bellies full, my mother in law and I, opened our cards. My youngest son, the ever witty, thoughtful, ingenious person he is, handed me a book. Upon first glance, I thought for sure it was specially made. (he does things like that) It truly looks like it has tape on the front.

See, doesn't that look handmade? I was so excited, UNTIL I OPENED IT! Much to my chagrin, this book is filled with pages that require the owner to basically destroy the book. The book my Son gave me, for Mother's Day. Just look at a couple of the pages...

To top it off, he put a message inside...

This MUST be a test! He knows how OCD/uptight/anal, I am. He expects me to cut loose and destroy this book AND give it back to him as proof I could do it! To think I gave birth to all 9 pounds, 3 ounces of him and that I could intentionally destroy something he gave me!!! I've got a newsflash for him... IT AIN'T HAPPENING, MISTER!

My daughter, on the other hand, gave me a rose. It was one of her roses that adorned my header, when I first started this blog. She specifically said it's a ""Sarcastic Granny"" rose. Yes, it will wither and die, but it won't be because I destroyed it on purpose. Smart girl, she knows not to mess with my two remaining brain cells. She will need a sitter, at some point.

** Pat, and any other males stumbling in, you may want to leave now. **

I was a bad granny. I've been so traumatized by something that happened the day my daughter brought my new grandson home from the hospital, I've been beside myself. I may have permanent damage.

My first three kids were boys. It's not like I've never been around them, or taken care of them, it's just been a REALLY LONG TIME. I do remember that changing their diapers is risky, if you aren't careful. I've been christened, more than once.

My first four grandchildren are girls. That's what I've grown accustomed to.

The traumatizing event happened during a diaper change. I wasn't even doing the changing, for crying out loud. Daughter and SIL were in the process and had everything laid out to do the job at hand and take care of the newly done circumcision. Prior to pulling the diaper off, they were doing the peek thing, to see what was in store. Everything looked fine and it was pretty hard to tell if the diaper was even wet. No point putting him through all that, for nothing, I decided to lend my experienced hand. Boy, did I! I reached down and squeezed the diaper, in the front, to see if it was wet and out comes the tiniest little scream, much like a newborn kitten!!! In a mere fraction of a second, I realized what I had done! I thought for sure I was going to faint, or vomit, I wasn't sure which. Forgot all about those boy bits. Remembered quickly, but not quick enough to avoid what I had already done. He must have thought Granny was trying to circumcise him again.

Do you think he will remember? God, I hope not. I don't think I did any permanent damage, but if his first words sound like Mickey Mouse... I'm headin' for the hills!

"The Cleveland State University wrestling team won each of the first three bouts Saturday afternoon, but visiting Binghamton stormed back to claim a 22-13 victory in the Vikings' regular-season finale inside Woodling Gymnasium.

The dual began at 149 pounds, and redshirt junior Grant Turnmire got the Vikings off to a good start. Filling in for primary starter Brady Barnett, Turnmire built a 5-0 lead after two periods. His opponent broke the shutout with an escape in the third, but Turnmire would a point of riding time to claim a 6-1 victory.

After a scoreless first period at 157, redshirt sophomore Nico O'Dor found himself trailing after five minutes. However, after tying the bout with an escape, he secured a takedown and held on for a two-point win.

Redshirt sophomore Ryan Ford was tied, 1-1, in the third period at 165 with each wrestler having secured an escape. Like O'Dor, Ford secured the tiebreaking takedown and was able to claim a 3-2 victory.

The Vikings would drop the next two bouts but still held the team score lead halfway through the dual. Junior Chris Morrow had fought valiantly against a top-10 opponent at 184 pounds, trailing by a single point late in the bout, but his opponent held off the upset bid.

True freshman Ben Smith never trailed in collecting a bonus-point win at 197 pounds. He had a two-point lead after five minutes but really poured it on in the final frame. He used three takedowns and an escape in the third stanza before adding a point of riding time to claim the major decision.

Junior Collin Kelly held the lead after the first period at heavyweight but was unable to hang on.

Redshirt sophomore Cameron Lathem was tied, 2-2, with his foe in the third period, but this time the Bearcats got the final takedown to claim the win.

After trailing by as many as seven points in his match, redshirt senior Armando Torres had cut his deficit to just three points late in the bout. In the top position, Torres was fighting to earn back points, but the period expired before he was able to do so.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

6 slices of sourdough bread, sliced 2 cm thick on an angle

2 large garlic cloves peppery extra-virgin olive oil

3 large oxheart tomatoes (or other full-flavoured tomatoes)

The Evolution of Home Sewing: 1958 and Today

Did you know that the Time Magazine online archives go back to 1923? I sure didn't, so I was amazed and delighted to find this very informative article called ""Sew & Reap"" about home sewing from the November 10, 1958 issue.According to this article, home sewing was a billion dollar industry at the time. This is in 50's money! I would be very interested to compare that to the profits of today's home sewing industry, wouldn't you?

The article really outlines the ways in which home sewing in 1958 was so influenced by Paris fashion:

Every calculated change in Paris means more money spent [on patterns]. So fashion-bent have sewing women become that patternmakers have all but junked the simple housedress designs that used to be their bread and butter. What more and more women want is the kind of high-fashion Vogue patterns long sold by Conde Nast. The originals would cost perhaps $600, but almost any woman can copy them for the cost of a $3 pattern and $50 worth of fine fabric (Vogue patterns even supply a Paris label).

That's interesting to compare to today's Vogue designer lines. I've enjoyed some of their Anna Sui offerings, but the others (Michael Kors, Donna Karan, etc.) have been a little staid for my taste - certainly not the trend-driven machine that it seems to have been in 1958.

What really blew my mind, though, was the fact that 20% of all women's garments in 1958 were made at home. Can you imagine?

And then there was the age of the women who sewed their own clothes:

One return prize for the industry is more and more younger sewers: the average home sewer's age has dropped from 45 in 1928 to 27 now, and by 1960 millions of teenagers will be sewing. A common but fashionable wedding present for suburban brides: a sewing machine.

These 27-year-old women of 1958 would be 78 today. Are they still sewing, do you think?

I tried in vain to find the average age of the home sewer today to compare to the stats of 1958. Though there has been an indisputable rise in young women sewing today, I would guess that the average person purchasing sewing supplies is of the boomer generation (the teenagers that the article predicted would be sewing in the 60's, I suppose!).

But there was such an incredible drop in average age from 1928 to 1958 - do you think it's possible we could see the same thing happen in the coming years?

One parallel I can see between the young women sewing in 1958 and young women sewing today is that is was viewed not as necessity, but as a creative outlet:

Millions of women now rank sewing as their No. 1—and often only—hobby. ""There's a whole new climate,"" says Simplicity's [director] Shapiro. ""They do it as an art form.""

Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on all this. From your age perspective (whatever it may be) how do you see the future of the home sewing industry?

Let's see, my mom would have been in her 20s in 1958 and was definitely sewing at least 20 percent of her clothing, if not more like 50 percent. Had she not had a stroke in recent years, she most definitely would still be sewing. I was a boomer, a preteen who learned to sew in the 60s. Still sewing, but not so much clothing these days. I do view it more as an art form now, not necessity, a hobby. My young adult daughter has little interest in sewing, unfortunately, but she likes seeing what I can make--maybe some day!

I'm not sure what a boomer is, but my mum grew up in a little village in the north of Sweden in the 60's and she had to sew her own clothes if she wanted something cool. There just wasn't any retail to speak of in that part of the country back then. Not for fashionable teenagers anyways. When I grew up in the 80’s and 90’s, my mum sewed for me, too. I was never interested in learning for myself. Until a couple of years ago when a friend taught me how to sew. Now it's a hobby I share with my mum. :-)

I ran the numbers through an inflation calculator, the first one a google search turns up, converting from 1958 dollars to 2008 dollars, cited in round numbers cause I already closed that browser page.

The Vogue pattern: 1958, $3; 2008, $22

The fabric: 1958, $50; 2008, $350+

The designer comparison price: 1958, $600; 2008, $4000+

The pattern price is in line with the printed price for Vogue patterns today, though I can't imagine anyone paying full price for a Vogue pattern.

What I find interesting about this little exercise is that a reason I usually hear cited for the decline in home sewing is the cost of fabric. But even the women I see who buy expensive fabric don't spend this much, as far as I can see.

Let's say the average fancy dress requires five yard of fabric for a full skirt and a yard of fabric for a bodice. That's 6 yards of fashion fabric. Double it for lining to get twelve yards. That would be nearly $30 a yard, on average, for that fabric.

While I have seen sewing bloggers who do spend that kind of money per yard, my sense is that is limited to clothing that requires much less total yardage to constuct.

How many yards of fabric did your red sheath dress take, Gertie? Five total, with lining?. If you spent $30 a yard average on that fabric it would have cost you $150.

I don't know about most of you, but I would find material that cost me half of that or less.

I'm currently making a Victorian ball gown that I will wear at least four times a year for a few years. I will have spent just over $75 when I'm finished. That's for more than 10 yards of fabric.

No, I don't think women quit sewing due to the oft-cited notion that fabric got expensive.

I'm 25 and have been sewing for about 3 years. I have several friends who do so as well, but the ""hobby"" really came out of a desire to make cute things for our baby girls.

I am however the only one I know of that is pursuing sewing as a professional career. I am a dressmaker's apprentice currently with some of my own work (which seems to be quickly building). It seems a not so lost art anymore though.

Just wanted to throw in a comment on the ""fabric got expensive"" argument aurelia.donka mentioned...

Fabric may not be any more expensive than in the 50s, but clothes can be bought REALLY cheap these days. Fast fashion is the thing now, and women are used to inexpensive, almost disposable clothing. You could probably buy multiple dresses from H&M for the cost of making a nice one yourself. I doubt that was true in 1958, no?

My great grandmother and grandmother used to sew and knit. They used to make all their own clothes and the clothes for their husbands and kids. My mother was not interested in sewing. She was more interested in pottery and painting. So my great grandmother and grandmother passed the craft on to me. For the longest time I wanted to become a fashion designer. Due to family pressure, that flew out the window and in turn I stopped sewing.

I started sewing again 5 years ago and I kick myself for ever stopping. I had forgotten how much fun it is.

Being of the boomer age group (and still in my 50's) I might be able to offer some insight. I have recently gotten back into sewing quite a bit. I never didn't sew, but sometimes it was only two or three things a year.

However in my teen years (late 60's/early 70's), I was the only one of my group of friends who did sew. And still am, except for those friends I've specifically met through sewing.

As to those of the next generation, I haven't met any who sew. I work with a variety of 20s/30s year olds, and they can't even imagine doing this. My nieces and daughter-in-law express interest very occassionally, but have not taken action.

I think sewing is a great creative outlet. I'm not sure anyone is sewing from economic necessity these days - so you are sewing because:

- you don't fit into the norm as to size (height, weight, etc.)- your taste is different than the garments the racks in the store hold;- you are looking to sewing as a creative outlet (OR SOME COMBO of all three).

to aurelia.donka and the fabric at $30/yard. I think that while that number is a little high, to buy the quality of fabric that could be found in the 50s you will definitely spend more (maybe not $30/yard but I've seen good quality everyday wools and silks for close to that) than they did in the 50s per yard. At least it seems that when I get vintage fabric from my Gran, the similar ones today are outrageous prices.

This is a very interesting point, Gertie (beware, long, clumsy English discourse to follow...).

I have no clue wether the situation has been the same in France at the time, because at this very moment, the clothing industry was very different in USA and in France (which took the ready-to-wear turn much later than USA, where big stores bought licences from Paris designers). No idea if it helps on the price question.

For what I see now, there are much more young women sewing in USA than there are in France, but I really think US is faaaar more crafty than France. I (a student) personnally began to sew two years ago, my grans learned to sew at school (one didn't sew anything but cushions and curtains since, the two others don't sew at all), but my mother, who began school in 1968, did not. If it's sometimes an economical option, I learned to sew because I considered it the best way to get clothes the way I liked (no relation to the vintage question, since I heard of vintage patterns less than a year ago and also sew neon madras minikilts), and also because I liked the feeling of a slightly more ethical, durable wardrobe.

So to me you're right: it has a lot more to do with creativity, but I'm also wondering if it is not, as Sarai pointed it, an reaction to consumerism; I'm far from a sewing expert but I hope I'll improve enough to move to slow fashion.

As for the future of home sewing, I sincerely think it has to do with how people will react to fast fashion and related issues such as ecology and human rights but maybe that will go with a renewal of custom-made and the raise of quality second-hand or micro-enterprise, or the pleasure you may have to buy something from someone you 'know'(Colette patterns as an example are not absolutely my style, but since I read Sarai's blog, I'd love to purchase one of the next seasons); I really think it has to be seen within a larger perspective, it's not home sewing alone.

Home Economics. Required girl course in junior high. I loved it, but I can imagine other people resented it.And of course we should include a discussion of minimum wage. And the near death of fabric-for-clothes stores once quilting took over. (I live in the far reaches, and the only fabric stores within 50 miles are Big Box and quilt stores. And no, I won't spend my not-enough money on something I can't touch first.)

My Mum is 78, loved sewing , made all her clothes and those for my sister and me, not because she had to but because she loved it, my auntie was the same. Mum has done little sewing since the late 1970s when her daughters left home and she started working and had more fun buying clothes, she has continued to knit though,that is her other passion. My auntie, however, is in her early 80s and has continued sewing and I don't think she will stop until she becomes incapable or dies.

I enjoy reading your interesting blog very much. The sheath dress looks very similar to one my mom wore in a photo dated 1960. She received a Singer sewing machine as a wedding gift from my father in 1959.

I have many wonderful memories associated with that sewing machine and of my mom sewing in the 1960s when she was in her 20s and a homemaker. She quit sewing when she went to work.

I am born in 1961 and have been sewing since a kid. I sew both crafts and garments. Some homedec. I sew less when I was younger because of time and money. Now that I have more of both, I sew more. I view sewing as a luxury hobby. I think it is less expensive to buy clothes than to sew them especially if you take time and effort into consideration.

I have 2 teen daughters who took some sewing classes at JoAnn. The youngest show interest in elementary school but she is now ""too busy"" to sew. The eldest dislike sewing but love fashion design. They both love that I can shorten hems, mend tears and fix zippers for their favorite ready to wear which seems to fall apart easily.

I think for teens it is more practical to buy than to sew since their size and fashion tastes change pretty fast. With the exception of special occasion eg prom gowns. No matter how much you pay for a dress, you always risk showing up at the event and finding someone in the same ready to wear dress which happened to both my daughters before.

Fashion-conscious career women who wants more quality and better fit and whose clothing can be worn longer may have more reason to sew. Also people with time and money to spare eg. retirees and empty nesters in their late 40s and older which make up most of my classmates at sewing classes.

I think the internet and shows like Project Runway have help alot in bringing excitement to sewing and to connect people who sews. Personally I think home sewing is here to stay, maybe not for necessity but for fun.

I hope that people continue to learn to sew and pick it up like I have, but I don't know how it will synthesize with the culture of today, with people who rely on their microwave and Hamburger Helper for a 'meal'.

I think the majority of people of my generation are obsessed with moving and doing things fast, so I don't know how sewing for pleasure could flourish.

As Sarai mentioned - clothing can be bought so cheaply. It's crap quality, but is cheap, and it means that people can buy 'new' things more often even if they aren't getting a deal. Taking the time to make something themselves, or PAYING someone else to do it, would probably not be seen as an option. And poor poor seamstresses, people so undervalue their work and the effort it takes to make something.

I think a LOT of people today probably don't sew because (as previously mentioned) clothing is so cheap. But, most cheap clothing (here in the UK, obviously I can't speak for elsewhere) is so poorly made, that I find it can actually work out cheaper to make yourself something, even if the fabric 'seems' pricey. The garment you make is likely to be twice as durable and probably better constructed.I'm a 70s baby so obviously can't comment with any degree of accuracy about 60s sewing trends but, I know my Mum (and her sister) did make their own clothes, both sewn and crocheted or knitted. My Nan sewed for a living, making men's trousers in a small factory but she still made most of her own clothes right up til she passed away. I always got the impression from my Mum that sewing amongst her generation was popular, if you wanted something nice, you made it. I do think, that it's no coincidence that a lot of the sewing community appears to be fairly eco-conscious. I myself, find it quite distateful that shops can sell a skirt for as little as £5, the economics just don't add up.

Yet another engaging and thought-provoking post from you Gertie. Thank you!

Like you, I would be interested in knowing what the statistics are for our time: what's the average age of sewists, what percentage are women (I would guess 99.99%, but I've been wrong before), how many sew as an art form (again, probably 99.99%, but...), etc.

My mom, one of those teenagers in the 60s, has sewed since she was 8. She entered doll clothes she sewed into the local state fair, and won a prize and the age of ten. Art form for sure. But when she was older, mother of five children on a Navy income, she sewed clothes for herself, the kids, even my father. That was more out of necessity. Now she sews as a way to unwind, keep herself busy, help other people (she often donates the things she makes), and so on. I suppose that for some people their reason for sewing changes depending on their stage in life.

When I was in middle school, then 'junior high' we still had Home Ec. I sort of learned to sew. We made a very unbecoming skirt that we had to wear to school. it scarred me and I didn't start sewing until a few years later when I was about 16. I am not only still sewing but making more and better clothing than ever before. I am now 59. I am thrilled to see so many young women sewing and using it as a creative outlet. Now young women can buy fashionable clothing at any price point so their reason for sewing is not going to be necessity, but enjoyment. Sewing is a deep pleasure for me as I am sure it is for most of the women sewing today.

I think the critical issue is that young women from my generation on (I was born in 1959) were encouraged to liberate themselves from the domestic arts. I went to a school that taught typing, cooking and sewing and not a lot else. By contrast my own daughters attend a school where they were not taught cooking and had on semester of sewing - taught by a woman who couldn't sew properly herself. Sewing has moved from domestic necessity (my family didn't have much money and the only store bought clothes were my father's business suits and shirts) to creative outlet. I really believe in the transmission of skills from generation to generation - and the blog is now making it cool to sew again.

I believe that the decline in home fashion sewing is due to the fact that sewing is not taught in school anymore. I learned to sew in school even though I had a mother and two sisters who could sew. My junior high school threw me in a sewing class(kicking and screaming by the way). I can remember Mccalls and Simiplicity patterns costing 25 - 50 cents and having a heart attach over the cost of Vogue patterns - 1.00 to 1.50. Of course it was Vogue you wanted. I remember this from the mid 60's. And of course it was always cheaper to sew then to buy ready to wear.

In 1958 my mother was 5, and she knitter her first jumper when she was 7 (Her mother knitted all the decreases around the shoulders and stuff) but she sewed most of her clothes as a teenager. She told me this horrible story of embroidering a wonderful hippy patch on the back or some store bought jeans that had worn a little thin. Her coal mining father got so angry at the thought of HIS daughter wearing a PATCH on her clothes that he threw the jeans into the fire. He associated patches on clothes as being really poor.

Also as a 23 year old I try to sew and knit as many of my clothes as possible.

In Serbia, clothing is really, really expensive. It is cheaper to buy the material and pattern and pay someone to make you a custom made piece, since the cost of labor here is negligible.

I would guess that while it's true that sewing in the US is becoming more ""cool,"" the hobby will never come close to approaching the popularity levels of the '50s and '60s. Factors that limit its growth include: high cost of materials; lack of access to quality materials; decline in sewing literacy; lack of patience in a culture driven by instant gratification; needlessly large wardrobes (back in the day when a girl only hoped to have 5 dresses, taking the time to make one right made more sense); opportunity cost of labor (women's time in general is ""worth more"" than 50 years ago, when one considers that today's woman is (in economic terms) overqualified for traditional homemaking tasks; the prevalence of cheap, high quality ready made clothing (you might gripe about quality control issues, but in other parts of the world the quality of ready made is much, much lower); the growing sentiment among women over 30 that ill-fitting ready made clothing is normal and acceptable; and last but not least, the myriad socially-acceptable (and less demanding) creative outlets for women that were not available 50 years ago.

I'm one of those ""boomer"" girls - the one that learned to sew in the 60's and at age 50 - I'm still sewing! However, there is a difference now. I remember that I could purchase fabric and patterns anywhere...Woolworths, Macys, Kmarts as well as the local fabric store which there was one in every town.

I also remember that I could take a sewing class from 6th grade on. That every home had a sewing machine and some sewing supplies. That is not the case today.

I have two thoughts on this...one that as we became a more consumer driven society, more women who sewed only because it was ""cheaper"" to do so became purchasers of cheap goods from discount chains. And two as more women gained access to more ""professional"" jobs some of the more ""womenly"" pursuits fell by the wayside. Seriously, how many women do you know that sew, cook well, garden, and/or can their food? These were all normal pursuits of the 50s woman!

And sewing has become an artform - because the people left pursuing it have turned it into a love, a craft, a way of expressing themselves the same way that a painter or a sculptor does.

As with all things, sewing has evolved...very few things in our society are the same as they were in the 50s!

My grandmother (born in 1920) used to sew everything when she was a young woman. Back then it was a necessity, since she didn't have the money to buy clothing for her large family. Right now she is 89 and hasn't sewn in a long time.

My mother (born in 1949) used to sew a lot when we were little. For herself, for us, for my father. But she doesn't anymore. She found a job when we were getting a little older and says she doesn't have the patience anymore to sew difficult garments. She does knit a bit sometimes for my daughter's dolls, or my little ones, but that is rare.

I am 33 years old now. I learned how to sew when I was little, then forgot about it for years and picked it up again when I was pregnant of my first born. I love it and can't imagine that I'll ever stop loving being creative. But ofcourse, you never know.

I don't sew because I have to, like my grandmother. I don't sew, because it's cheaper than buying, like my mother. I sew, because I want to. Because I like the sewing itself, because of how I feel when I sew, or knit for that matter, because it relaxes me and makes me feel grounded. And because I am starting to feel more and more that I want to surround myself with things that mean something. That were made with love, instead of in factories, without a thought.

And because of that last factor I think sewing could become more popular in the future. I hear more and more people around me getting tired of all the materialism. I hear them grow tired of all the 'stuff', the 'clutter' that surrounds them. I hear people say that they, like myself, want to go back to a more 'basic' lifestyle. A slower lifestyle, a simpler lifestyle. And making your own clothing, baking your own bread, it all seems to fit in the trend I think I see.

Ofcourse trends go by and are followed by other trends. And I can imagine that I come in contact mostly with people who think like I think. So maybe my idea can't be projected on a large scale. But still... I wouldn't be surprised when sewing would win in popularity the following years. I certainly do hope it will..

My goodness, I enjoyed each comment! It is like a breath of fresh air to read about people who know how to sew and love it. I was born in 1947 to parents who grew up during the depression, and who learned that saving money was a necessity. They passed it on, and I sewed a lot in high school, then majored in clothing and textiles at Texas Tech during the '60s. I learned how to sew at Tech--tailoring, flat pattern design, draping (still have the dress form from the draping class), and I wouldn't take for what I learned. I still teach some Family and Consumer Science classes at high school, and believe me I teach how to cook and sew. I believe that kids have an inner desire to create something with their own hands, and if they never pick up a needle or sauce pan again, at least they will know how. Besides, who know which kid will become a designer or interior decorator, and they will need to have the skill of sewing. I really liked what Sarai said about the ""disposable wardrobe."" Clothing is so cheap, and women are so busy there is no need to sew, but we all have a need to relax, and create. Pass on the skill girls, and have fun doing it.

I just spent a few days in North Dakota helping my mom go through her storage room. I was horrified and amused that, while wedding dresses and a couple wool suits and amazing formals my grandma (b. 1911) sewed for my mom (b. 1945) had survived, nothing that my grandma sewed for herself had been saved! Only the scraps of some tantalizing, to-die-for fabrics had been preserved in some quilts. I thought we'd hit pay dirt when we found a zipper hanging bag that was Grandma's. Inside, lovingly preserved, alongside her treasured mink stole, were three scratchy polyester gowns. Not my taste but I figured still interesting to see her construction- but no! Turned out all three were store bought! I turned to my mom aghast, she laughed and said that I didn't understand how rare and exciting store-bought clothes were to them in ""those days"". Grandma didn't find any reason to save the things she made for herself, but was so proud of these dresses from a store!

As others have said, a lot of their sewing was more out of need and budget than preference, although my grandmother did enjoy the creative side of it. But my mom particularly was too tall for off-the-rack, especially where they lived, an 8 hour drive from the nearest big department store.

As for the next generation, my half-sister, who grew up without any sewing in the home at all, asked that my mom and I teach her kids as much as they'd sit still for, so they could at least have a little of that demystifying exposure at a young (preteen) age. We ran out of time this trip, but we'll see how it goes at Thanksgiving. I like that my sister had the idea, though. I'm more of a sporadically-enthusiastic than an accomplished sewer, but I've always known I can go back to it and have the confidence that I can learn because of the constant exposure when I was growing up-- it's just something I take for granted that I can do, even if never to the level my grandmother did. But it's just the reverse for my sister; she's always been kind of off-put and intimidated by sewing because of her lack of exposure or instruction. It feels more like a club she's excluded from. Of course she could learn if she wanted to and I'd love to teach her, but to her it feels like too big an undertaking, more like belatedly taking up a new language from scratch. But she wants her kids to have that initiation, so they know they can do it later if they ever want to.

Talking to my sister made me think about how it really does make all the difference to pass on by example through generations-- pass on that initiation. I don't know about others' Home Ec clases, but the uninspiring duffel bag I made in mine would never have made me want to touch a sewing machine ever again! Also, as many things as I've learned from books, the web, and trial & error, nothing beats taking home a frustrating project to my mom and getting that hands-on help. She gets a kick out of my renewed interest in something she pretty much packed in for lack of need anymore in the 80s.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"4 Ways Authentic Leaders Use Feedback

Subscribe to Email Updates

“When we were a smaller organization, I had a lot more influence on the culture than I do now,” says Sean Kelly, CEO of SnackNation, a company that delivers healthy snacks to offices and homes across America. SnackNation currently has about 150 employees headquartered in Culver City, California.

Sean says as the company roster has expanded, he’s had to be more intentional about scaling the culture, and that includes being more proactive about collecting team members’ feedback.

“There were multiple phases where the influence of culture changed as our company grew. But we certainly felt it when we got to around 90 to 100 team members. I'd even say around the 30- or 40-person mark, our mid-level leadership influenced culture more than top leadership,” shares Sean.

“As a leader, I could still help guide and shape our culture—but it was really no longer primarily under my influence.”

“I’ve become more accepting of poll assessments and various surveys as the organization has grown larger; I'm not shaping the culture as much as I used to, and so it's very good for me to continually ensure that I understand what's going on, what's being said, and what's being felt.”

1. Use feedback to measure progress

“Everything's relative, but as long as you're getting better, and as long as people have a reason to believe that—or that there is the chance for things to get better—the team members are going to be excited, and they are going to be engaged.”

Don’t focus too much on where you are at now; instead, consider culture assessments as a barometer to examine over time. Another tip from Sean: Start by seeking to understand what motivates people and what people need to do their best work. If you don’t know the answer to those questions, then the information you’re gathering may not be as useful as it could be.

2. Use feedback to promote accountability

Getting feedback from employees or using engagement surveys is also a way to ensure and promote shared accountability. “It helps to build a culture of ownership. If we ask somebody, ‘What is your plan to achieve success?’ Or, ‘What support are you seeking from us to help you achieve success?’ We are able to get answers to those questions, and then hold people accountable for growth,” explains Sean.

“Often times, there are a lot of answers to these questions that indicate how someone is feeling about the organization or what they need. If we give them what they need to be successful, then we have a plan together, where as long as we're both improving, we're going to get there and we can hold all parties accountable.”

3. Use feedback to build transparency

One of the best ways SnackNation is able to check the pulse of their company culture is through monthly, open Q&A sessions.

These are anonymous, question-and-answer format sessions where anyone within the company can ask top leadership any question they want. In turn, leaders get vulnerable and honest in front of the entire group.

“We don't know who wrote any of the questions. We also don't allow anyone else to see the questions that other people are asking beforehand. They just enter it into a shared Google Document and we answer it in front of the team,” he says.

The open-ended questions uncover deep, meaningful insights around what people are thinking and feeling—and better yet, why they are feeling that way. “You can spot trends. You can also see if it's one person who's just frustrated and having a bad day, or maybe it's a disgruntled employee versus actually recognizing themes that multiple people feel,” explains Sean.

While they also use regular surveys, this is just one more way leaders at SnackNation embrace transparency while equipping team members to share what’s on their mind.

4. Use feedback to celebrate shared values

In this video, Mari Wenrick, Chief Champion of Culture at Value Added Packaging (VAP) explains how the company conducted a culture survey to gauge attitudes and perceptions within the company. “There were certain questions that I asked, such as, ‘What do you think about the company?’, ‘What do you think about the owners?’” Employees had the opportunity for the feedback to be anonymous.

It might have taken vulnerability on leadership’s behalf to ask such questions, but the feedback resulted in a major milestone for the company in terms of its culture journey.

The employee feedback was consistently articulated using the VAP language; it focused on the company values of love, family, care, and respect. “[This feedback] showed that they…really understood what we were doing and believed, and they had ownership in it, which was fantastic,” says Mari.

What employees wrote in their feedback was so moving that they put the messages on display on campus, which was another way they were able to celebrate the company’s culture.

The behavior of employees shifted from conscious actions to unconscious, cultural norms in alignment with the company values, says Mari. The unconscious was, “This is now what I'm a part of, and this is what I believe in,” she explains.

“And that, to me, was an amazing turning point because it showed that they bought into what we were doing and really had ownership in it.”

"Trieste Science+Fiction 2016

Edizione 16 | 1 – 6 novembre 2016

In 1926 Hugo Gernsback founded in the United States the first magazine completely dedicated to science fiction literature, “Amazing Stories”, thus establishing the existence of a genre which the authors already knew very well but which still didn’t have a name.
In 1976 the International Science Fiction Film Festival in Trieste remembered the 50th anniversary of this event with an exhibition dedicated to pulp magazines at the Castle of San Giusto.
In that same year, the retrospective Fant’Italia, organized by La Cappella Underground, ventured – for the first time in a systematic manner – into the research of the Italian fantastic, among lost celluloids and repertoire films, widely anticipating the more recent secret stories of our cinema, which have caused its rediscovery and revaluation on a global scale.
This is where the 16th edition of the Trieste Science+Fiction Festival starts from. In the DNA of the event there is always the good old Science Fiction Festival, but in the algorithm that animates us in the cockpit there is above all the spirit of research at 360 degrees, to bring on stage the best and the most recent independent sci-fi productions coming from all the corners of planet Earth. This is also the reason why in this 16th edition the cinéphiles will benefit of one extra day of program.
But the Festival broadens its range of action especially in a multidisciplinary direction, if in the age of crossover this term can still be used. More music, with the ultra sounds “made in FVG” of the opening concert of TARM and of those by DJ Yoda during the Invasion of the Body Snatchers Night.
More comics, with the o cial image signed by Davide Toffolo and the exhibition of Nathan Never in the 25th anniversary of the most popular science fiction series in Italy. More video games, with the vintage video game space Play It Again. More animation and stop motion, with two dedicated labs. More attention to the industry dimension and to training, with the first Fantastic Film Forum open to the professionals of the sector. More science, with the Futurology Meetings in collaboration with the most prestigious scientific institutions of our territory and Future Environment screenings. More attention to the younger audience, with a greater number of initiatives dedicated to schools and teenagers. More of Trieste, with Esterno/Giorno walks through the movie scene locations in town. More dramatics, with an exceptional guest star and Urania Life Achievement award who has seen things you people wouldn’t believe…
It is no chance that in our vision between science and fiction there is a plus!
And so, quoting a song particularly in tune with the image of this edition of the Festival: “Come one, come all. The incredible spetaculo de la vida, the incredible spetaculo de la muerte!”. And we’d like to add: “the incredible show of scientia, the incredible show of fantasia!”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The Newlyweds.

Katy Perry.

The Cousins.

This is how my family characterized several different people we recently crossed paths with while on vacation. Here’s a brief description of each.

The Newlyweds: Without going into too much graphic detail, this young couple basically couldn’t keep their hands off each other or their faces far apart. They gave the impression they were on their honeymoon.

Our first impression of the Newlyweds was that they had no time for anyone but each other.

Katy Perry: This beautiful young woman looks like a less voluptuous Katy Perry, the “California Gurls” and “Firework” pop singer. She’s tall, confident and willowy, with jet black hair and big, round eyes — just like Katy Perry.

We noticed that Katy Perry was traveling with an older man and wondered if they were a couple (surely she was in it for the money, our devious minds figured) or a father and daughter.

The Cousins: These five little boys are ages 4 and 5 with lots of energy.

The Cousins appeared to be traveling with their grandparents.

On the second day of our vacation, I found myself next to the Newlyweds. So I asked if that, indeed, is what they were.

Turns out they are not married and were not on their honeymoon. But the man, Adam, had recently proposed to the woman, Jennifer. (She said yes!)

It also turns out they were quite nice and friendly, and they did have time for and enjoyed talking to others. They even offered to lend my husband a pair of Adam’s pants for a fancy dinner if need be since my husband hadn’t packed nice pants.

We crossed paths with the Newlyweds several times and always had pleasant conversations and enjoyed learning about their backgrounds.

While I was trading introductions with the Newlyweds that first time, I was pleasantly surprised to look up at one point and see that Katy Perry had engaged my shy, younger daughter in conversation.

Turns out she wasn’t a pop singer, but rather a Mankato State University student who was vacationing with her dad. She was fun and energetic and often took my daughters under her wing and encouraged them to participate in different activities. We learned this wasn’t the first time someone told her she looked like Katy Perry.

We even had a bit of interaction with the Cousins. When asked, Grandma confirmed that the young boys were, indeed, cousins and not quintuplets. A few of them came up to me one day, somewhat shyly, and said “hi.” They actually said quite a bit more, but in a language I didn’t understand.

They entertained us as they darted about and sneakily crept up to me to try to converse, and we admired the grandparents for taking the five boys on vacation.

One of the most fun aspects of this vacation was the people watching we did. Even better were the people we met who became friends for the week, including the Newlyweds, Katy Perry and many others.

These were people we attached a label and story to based on their looks. We were lucky enough to get to know them a bit to go beyond the label.

First impressions — we learned it’s worth looking deeper and is worth the time and effort to go beyond the first impression.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

I just took a pie out of the oven. A pie and two custards, actually, as I had too much pumpkin filling for the crust. The pie turned out wonderfully--the custards a winning experiment. Best of all, though, was what happened while they were baking.

The house was quiet and I was alone in the kitchen.

After stirring up the pie filling, I tucked into the corner chair/step-stool, a treasured perch of several in the house, leaned back against the wall, and napped gently to the smell of cinnamon, cloves, and ginger while next to a warm oven with a window open to the cool behind me.

It was a most welcome and needed embrace. School is out until next week but the freedom is filled with a significant writing project that I need to begin these days. I wonder if the naps are my body and mind's way of helping me make the transition to writing mode-- a way to put the kids and the chaos of school aside and turn my face again toward the muse, toward the spirit, adopting anew the feeling of being loved like no other, the feeling of being a delight and beholding a delight. The feeling of living inside the Word and trying to write an opening for others as well as marking my own journey for myself.

""9:51 AM. Tucked into the stairwell above the entrance to the main church level, waiting for the 9:00 Mass to let out but not in any hurry. I am quite comfortable, actually...warm, pleasantly secure, and in a position to hear and see much. Listening to the cantor sing during communion-- ""Soon and Very Soon"" which blended into the Taize ""Jesus Remember Me."" So lovely and so smooth the pieces fitting into one another. It occurs to me as I sit here, listenign to bits of the Family Faith program going on in the Mary Chapel, watching people begin to gather in the foyer, and hearing the movement that indicates the close of Mass, that a stairwell might not be where most would choose to perch while picking up a pen and paper. What is it about this place that speaks to me of being at home? Hmm.

I think some is that it is a bit worn and rubbed down at the edges from years of use and prayer. The whole building. The steps are scooped out in the middle from a hundred plus years of ascent and descent, the pews are darkened and worn to a shine. Yes, I find God in the broken-in-ness. That, actually, is where I most readily find God. There is a depth, a longevity, a history, to what is broken-in. A comfort in one's own being. Perhaps it is me who is becoming broken-in and more comfortable...

Funny, this makes me think of one of my favorite words...glory. There is a depth there for me too. A history, a richness that comes with living, with seeing, tasting, knowing, feeling. The glory of God made known in me? Deeper and deeper it reaches to draw out the story, the richness, the full-being-ness. Instead of dust to dust, perhaps instead glory unto glory--from the creative, story-filled, loving, depths of God to broken-in and flexible, stretchable, open humanity and then back again to the heart of all that is most wondrous, most just, most compassionate, most glorious...""

1) Do you have a food processor? Can you recommend it? Which is to say, do you actually use it?

Have access to one--but prefer chopping by hand. There is something satisfying about wielding a knife and watching the pile of ingredients mound.... there's also the sensory experience--the feel of the knife slicing, the sound, the juices, scents, and textures all immediately at hand.

2) And if so, do you use the fancy things on it? (Mine came with a mini-blender (used a lot and long ago broken) and these scary disks you used to julienne things (used once).)

Nope.

3) Do you use a standing mixer? Or one of the hand-held varieties?

Hand mixer when necessary--stiff arm and a good spoon otherwise. I do admit to coveting my Grandmother's vintage KitchenAide, though.

4) How about a blender? Do you have one? Use it much?

Now we're talking! Love the blender--especially when it comes to soup. Nothing better for mixing-ing/smoothing into creamy goodness. The first time I used our new one, though, whoa! Everything and every one within a block's radius (give or take) was baptized. Tomato soup every which way. Let's just say a new motor is far, far more potent than one, say, twenty years old.

5) Finally, what old-fashioned, non-electric kitchen tool do you enjoy using the most?

We have a fabulous wooden... implement. I think it must have been a spoon at one point, but the round edges have flattened some and it is now more of a gentle triangle on a handle. Terribly practical for picking things up and flipping, scooping and scraping. And, nothing, nothing, nothing, beats a good sharp chef knife, a heavy bottom dutch oven, and a cast iron skillet.

A homily for the Feast of Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne, Religious of the Sacred Heart who brought the Society to the United States in 1818.

Readings: Isaiah 52:7-10 ; Psalm 63; Lk 12:22-34

""Do not worry about your life and what you will eat, or about your body and what you will wear…can any of you by worrying add a moment to your lifespan? If even the smallest things are beyond your control, why are you anxious about the rest?""

A good question.

Go ahead, Philippine Duchesne! Get on the ship! Sail across a tempestuous ocean, to an unknown land, to uncertain work, in an unnerving language, with unfamiliar people…

And by the way, don't you worry about a thing… Ummm Hmmm…. How much easier for us to hear this in our time—because we know it all came out! Philippine became a saint, the network of Sacred Heart schools exists, and there are over 300 Religious of the Sacred Heart in the United States.

We know how it all came out… or, do we? I wonder if this story might have sounded familiar to some of you…perhaps if I put it this way—

Go ahead, new fifth graders! Climb those stairs! Go to the new land known as the Middle School! Don't worry about your uniform, where you are supposed to be going, or when lunch will be. Sixth graders—learning the names of new students, new teachers, all that new English vocabulary?? No problem. Seventh graders, that new language of Upper School—peer group, life skills, X-period, Advisory, Visual Foundations… I'm sure it will work out just fine. And teachers, go ahead, teach the subject you've never taught! Be a homeroom teacher for the first time! And, by the way, don't worry. Yep. Right.

What was Philippine's response to the multitude of unknowns? She prayed…always, according to her beloved Potawatomie. She turned to her God who she believed would not abandon her to her worries, she turned to her God that would not cast her hope back into the sea but rather would lead her feet through the prairie grass…all the way until today when with the eyes of faith, we look to the mountain of those who have made a difference in our world and are able to say ""How beautiful upon the mountain are the feet of the one announcing peace, bearing good news, announcing salvation.""

But, today, in this time and place, I'd like us to think bigger than feet. How beautiful upon the mountain are the heart, the hands, the mind, the feet…of those who work to bring about a world where we help one another, where we treat everyone with dignity, and where all are loved…that is God's vision… this is what Philippine now sees from that mountain. This is what we will see when we join her and walk our own journey with our heart and hands and mind and feet… without worry about the small matters, but by prayer and trust in God and the multitude around us. Our hands, mine, yours, yours., yours… our hearts, minds, …these are the hands and hearts and minds of God. The only ones God has. God's people, God's beloved children who are called to put aside concerns for ourselves and prepare the way for the coming of Love.

As you now know, lunch is at 11:45, the uniform guidelines are in the handbook, and most specialized vocabulary is explained in orientation. What's left is only for us to seek God, bring forth the vision in own time and space and way. May Philippine's pioneer spirit be with us all. God already is. Always is. No worries. But not easy.

""Sitting in a pew, watching the choir arrange themselves in the section where I usually tuck in...now listening to them practice the Gloria and finding it a much more pleasant alternative to the woman who is speaking even louder now to be heard by the tour group members moving through the main part of the church. The choir has moved on now to the psalm and the aleluia...and just as I began to float on the acoustics, someone carried by a a box labeled ""angel wings."" For some reason, I find that rather endearing...and comforting on some level...spare wings...that there would be angel wings available to use when the proof was needed. And, all the better that it was a simple cardboard box, written on in marker. A simple container that lets glory be glory. I can't help but think that the angels would be perfectly okay with that. I can't help imagining the conversation--""Okay, folks, they're not buying it. Got to break out the wings."" ""Aw geez, the wings??"" ""Yep, no choice on this one. Formal occassion and all..."" Someone gets sent to the closet to sift and sort through boxes until finding the one wrapped with a bit of twine and labeled in permanent marker, ""Angel Wings."" Then there's the trying on...sort of like choir robes, I imagine. Somewhat cumbersome, perhaps, but tradition. Big wings, small wings, fluttery wings and flappy wings... and you know when you found the right pair because your cheeks get warm and you find yourself wondering about the stars.""

I am planning a Mass with 45 kids and two other teachers. To get the maximum input, several different groups were created and pieces assigned. One homeroom, write the petitions and pick the kids to read; one homeroom, the offertory-pick the symbol to be carried forward in addition to the candles, flowers, bread and wine and who would carry each. My religion class, a mix of the homerooms, would pick the music and fill out the rest of the roles.

In religion, the kids split into two groups--one starting with song selection--taking into consideration the readings which we read outloud together, the other with assigning roles. When done, the group switched to the other topic. The only input I had was that the selections for both had to give evidence of reasonable thought and ultimately, I was the one who ratified their selelctions.

They chose fantastic music! Perfectly suited to the celebration and the readings and indicative of the preferred liturgical style of the kids-- songs with zip, songs with harmonies, songs with life and connection for the students. I took their papers, went to the music teacher, suggested a plan using a mix of the suggestions from the two groups, and she easily agreed.

I told the kids the next day which songs we were doing and they were SO thrilled. We suggested those!! We can do these?? Really?? Awesome!! You listened!!

Well, yes... you made wonderful suggestions, clearly connected to the reason for the celebration and the readings...why wouldn't I listen to you-- you are planning the Mass!

They had such smiles on their faces.

Makes me glad to be an adult at moments like that... an adult who has the chance to help a kid see their own worth, their own value, that what they have to say is important, that reasonable thought and passion behind something helps it to fly.

I was having tea while visting a friend this afternoon when conversation turned to music and whether someone who knows music parses sound into notes instinctively the same way my friend, an artist, can parse shades and colors into component pieces that add up to the whole. She sees the whole and can see inside enough to see the pieces that come together to create it. We mulled this for a while, the similarities between music and visual art--for the one who knows how, the vision is through the whole to the inside structure that created it.

This got me thinking about writing and reading poetry and other forms of written expression. I realized that for me, the process with this format is reversed. I hear the pieces, I hear the structure, and a whole is created. By the rubbing of syllables, by the procession of patterns, images juxtaposed, and rhythmic rituals, something Other is created--a larger whole. I start, though, with the pieces...the words themselves. How they encounter one another in my mouth or ears when read aloud by me or someone esle, or how they interact when read silently in my mind, builds the larger picture.

This moved our conversation into the role voice plays in helping the words find one another and welcome each other's company...or not. I was struggling to explain my meaning and ended up referencing pasta.

Sometimes, when I hear things read aloud, the words are cut off from one another, not in relationship yet, simply occupying space next to each other. Crunchy raw pasta in the box.

Sometimes, the voice overpowers the words, running them into one another, coming on too strong. The mushy, sticky with gluten, uni-pasta of overboiling.

Then you have al dente when each piece is still itself, each word its own syllables, but flexible, chewy almost. It can bump into other pieces of pasta and you can feel the give and take, it neither falls to pieces nor adheres inextricably. It is filling and substantive... its best pasta-ness being drawn forth.

I think the voice/outside the mind delivery of Word or poetry can achieve the same thing...Expression that satisfies by honoring the fullness of language's capacities...

I'm making home-made mac and cheese for dinner, by the way. Tomatoes and sauteed onions are mixed in for a kick. A limerick, I think, would be the equivilent. Predictable...but often with a twist.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Careers in Shipping, Marine & Energy Sectors

Making waves in the offshore industry

Thursday, February 21 - 2013

V.Ships Turkey is delighted to announce it has successfully
concluded an offshore crewing contract with Dubai-based seismic
research vessel operator Polarcus DMCC.

The agreement follows the news of the sale of Polarcus Samur -
an eight-streamer 3D world class seismic vessel - to the Turkish
owners TPAO (Turkish Petroleum Corp.) on February 11, 2013.
Polarcus will continue to provide support services to TPAO,
including technical and crew management as part of a three year
contract.

The vessel will be renamed Barbaros Hayreddin Pasa after the
legendary Ottoman Admiral and will carry the Turkish flag under
Turkish International Ship Registry (TUGS).

Harun Duzgoren, Managing Director of V.Ships Turkey (pictured),
said: ""We are very excited to be part of this important initiative,
which confirms Turkey's position as a new and emerging player in
the oil and gas world.

""As V.Ships' regional office, we possess the necessary skillset
and experience to deliver on quality for our offshore clients like
Polarcus. As a direct result of this dedication to quality and cost
optimisation, this is our fourth back to back offshore marine
services contract in the last three years.

""The vast majority of our crew have been with us in other similar
projects in the Black Sea and other parts of the world, so we are
confident that they will integrate quickly with Polarcus crew
on-board.""

As per the legislation, 51 per cent of her crew - as well as the
Master - will need to be Turkish nationals. V.Ships Turkey will
support Polarcus in complying with this requirement by providing 13
Turkish crew members. A seismic vessel uses seismic waves to
pinpoint and locate the best possible area for oil drilling in the
middle of oceans.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Applying for Passport and Visa? Here’s what you need to know about Police Clearance Certificate

Applying for Passport and Visa? Here’s what you need to know about Police Clearance Certificate

For the beginners, applying for a new identification or making a trip abroad offer ascend to many inquiries. One among the regular is presumably what does PCC demonstrate? Well, this post is an endeavour to highlight some of the important pointers on PCC.

The Police Clearance Certificate, in short PCC, is issued to every single imminent candidate from India looking for an outing to a different country for business, long stay or for residential purpose. Be that as it may, individuals from India flying out to an alternate nation on Tourist Visa are not qualified to apply for PCC. This authentication assumes a crucial part while applying for an identification and visa; and relying upon the nation and reason for visit, candidates might be solicited to give different sorts documents while applying for the same.

By and large, a PCC is given by the Regional Passport Office of the candidate’s area where he/she has been staying for most recent a half year or progressively and the same gets issued by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). Henceforth, the area of the candidate is of the quintessence while issuing a PCC. Individuals applying for a PCC having no satisfactory address verification, may confront challenge while arranging their abroad excursions. A portion of the archives that a candidate can give to help his/her address verification may incorporate a bank explanation. To get this announcement as your current address evidence, you can ask for the bank expert for the same to change your address and issue a bank articulation for most recent one year. When you get this report, sign it and get it stamped. It would be ideal if you be educated that downloading the announcement won’t get the job done the reason, as it needs to get stamped authoritatively.

While applying for a PCC, a candidate may experience two stages wherein, he/she may require either physical police check or PCC stamp. In the event that a candidate is requested physical police check then he/she will be given a receipt number alongside an archive that he/she needs to convey home. In like manner, the candidate is additionally imparted by the important specialist saying the name and contact number of the cop will’s identity going to the candidate’s home for verification.

Once physical police confirmation is done, the following concern is acquiring the PCC. Accumulating a PCC after check relies upon two situations. To begin with; if a candidate is dwelling in his/her nation for not as much as a year then it might require half a month. Second; if the candidate is dwelling in his/her nation for over one year time then the check happens in next 2-3 days. After that a candidate is prepared to gather his/her visa from the passport center and get a PCC letter issued.

Then again, the necessity of a PCC stamp appears when physical police confirmation isn’t required. To complete it, an applicant has to go to the counter where PCC letter is taken and stamped by the authorised individuals. There are three stamps that are put crosswise over including:

An underwriting alongside the application number of the candidate saying the name of the visting nation

A stamp of MEA

An authorisation stamp giving the leeway

From there on, the assigned individual from the counter stamp on applicant’s passport. Having done, the approved individual further signs the letter and the passport page.

So this is what a PCC is all about. To know other information on visa, passport and documentation prerequisites for overseas trip keep following Visas of the World.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Gun Control Lawmaker Facing Recall

The organizers of an effort to recall Colorado Senate President John Morse turned in Monday more than twice the number of signatures required to force a special election, possibly setting the stage for an expensive, national battle over gun control.

If the signatures are determined to be valid and survive a court challenge, it’s likely voters in Morse’s Senate district will decide at a special election in September whether to oust the Colorado Springs Democrat.

Morse’s support of gun-control legislation in the 2013 session as well as his leadership style sparked the recall effort.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"“Spike! No, Spike!” Too late, my mutt Spike was busily sniffing up the butt of another dog, one that didn’t seem to mind really, but the gaze from the stud that held the other end of that dog’s leash made me embarrassed anyway. I tugged on the leash and finally Spike minded me, coming over with a hurt look on his face as if to say that he was just being a good neighbor. I fished around for something to say to the well built guy whose dog just got nose raped by mine when he smiled and reached out a hand.

“No harm done as I can see and anyway, dogs will be dogs. My name’s Rick and Henry’s my dog.” I introduced myself and Spike, who decided since I was talking nicely with the fine fellow that it would be ok to start sniffing HIM. He’d just began at the man’s shoe and I hastily tugged on the leash again in fear that he’d complete the “trick” that I’d taught him.

“No, Spike, no!” Again, he gave me that hurt look and came back to ‘hmpf’ at my feet, watching both Henry and Rick carefully just in case I changed my mind. Indeed, I would have been quite pleased to have Spike perform his “trick” with this young man, for he was tall, muscular in all the right places and had that smile that made me just melt when one was directed at me. His hair was dark blond, close cropped military style and his eyes were a deep blue that sparkled as he watched Spike and I. Clean shaven and wearing tight ‘mufti’ type t-shirt and shorts, I’d pegged him as one of the countless marines living off base as they had for many years. His body was in fine US Government shape, evident from the tight clothing as was the fact that he was well endowed at the crotch area. Later on I was to find that he was in the Reserves and actually it was that membership that brought us together through our dogs.

As we talked we had headed to the apartment complex’s newly created dog park, a fenced area of well maintained grass and benches where dogs could run off leash and play in a secure area. I found it amusing that in the year before this same area was a children’s ‘tot lot’ but as it was never used by the few families with kids it was converted to what was really needed. We entered the dog park and secured the gate behind us, got ourselves a set of plastic poop gloves and released our dogs!

Off they tore, like two school kids let loose after chores, romping and peeing on everything, sniffing everywhere and, of course, each other. Both dogs were ‘fixed’ males, but it was funny to see them still highly interested in each other’s butts. Rick and I settled on a bench and chatted about various things, until he got quiet as he watched our dogs play.

“What is it, Rick? You seem distracted.” I said as I broke from watching HIM to see what was up.

He shrugged and turned towards me. “Well, I got to leave here in a few weeks for my Reserve shift and I have nowhere for Henry to stay while I’m gone.” Rick sighed and I sighed as I watched his muscles flex under the tight clothing. “He’s a good dog, but most of my friends just don’t want the burden of taking care of a dog, even if it is only a few weeks out of the year.”

I thought about it some and murmured that things would work out somehow. I had the same problem when I went on vacation, but made enough money to board Spike with the vet if I had to. Seeing this guy all concerned about his dog tugged at my heart (as well as his body did my cock) so I offered to take care of Henry as it was obvious to both of us that our dogs got along quite well.

“Two dogs for a short time can’t be that much of a bother,” I said, basking in the growing smile on Rick’s face, “and I’m sure that they don’t eat so much that I’ll go broke. I figure I can take them for walks together and if Henry doesn’t mind going out to do his business when Spike goes, I think we can do this with no problem.” Rick looked like somebody just handed him a million dollars and to my delight, hugged me hard before I realized what he’d done.

“Oh man, you just relieved me of my worst worry!” His hug had, of course, brought our lower bodies close enough to touch and our hairy lower legs pressed together briefly until he released me and sat back, grinning broader than any time earlier that day. “I know Henry and Spike will get along great and of course I’ll leave money for Henry’s food. I don’t think having a brother will bother Henry at all, in fact he’ll be almost on vacation himself!”

We laughed and then it was time to head back to our respective apartments after policing the park as good citizens should after their dogs. Disposing of the used gloves in the special trash cans, we put the leashes back on our dogs and headed out through the gate. Rick stopped and grabbed my arm before I turned off towards my apartment. “Here’s my phone number and address. Feel free to drop by. I’m home most evenings and always keep a six pack and steaks in the fridge for my buddies.” He handed me a card from his back pocket with this information on it.

“That sounds great, Rick,” I said as I pocketed the card and shook hands with him. “I’ll give you a call when I get back to my place and pass my info to you as well.” He grinned and we headed our two ways with our dogs, who looked a bit disappointed they couldn’t play more with each other. I called Rick a few minutes later and gave him my address and phone number and we also exchanged cell phone numbers just in case. After I’d hung up I was rather horny and had Spike perform his ‘trick’ before showering and setting up for my own dinner.

A few days later Rick called and invited Spike and I to dinner. “Like I said, I got beer and steaks, but if you want to bring something that would be ok.” I volunteered to bring what I called a ‘man’s salad’ which made him laugh and later that day arrived with Spike and my salad. Rick whistled at the hearty salad I’d made and I explained that the idea of a ‘man’s salad’ was to make it chunkier and put more stuff in it than most women did. We shared the salad and steaks while our dogs had a little bit of steak as well and then took our beers out to Rick’s balcony to relax.

I complemented Rick on his steaks and he made a comment that meat was his specialty, something that was loaded with innuendo and after a few more comments like that I turned and, emboldened, asked Rick if he was bisexual.

“No, are you?” When I told him I was gay, he smiled. “Me too, cool how that worked out.” We laughed and now we openly cruised each other, checking out each other’s hard bodies and especially each other’s thickening crotches. Spike noticed us and happily went to Rick, first sniffing his bare leg and slowly sniffing and licking upwards until he got to where Rick’s shorts began.

“Spike, No!” I wasn’t sure if Rick was ready for Spike’s ‘trick.’

“What’s wrong, Mike, he’s just interested in me, that’s all.”

I shook my head, watching Spike as he ‘hmpft’ again and lay at Rick’s feet. “I taught Spike a special trick that you might find embarrassing, Rick, and unfortunately Spike likes the reward so much he tries his trick with every guy I meet.”

Rick’s eyebrows went up and he said, “I’d like to see this trick if I can. Do I need to do anything special?”

“The trick works best if you’re naked, at least that’s how I taught Spike,” I said, reddening a bit in embarrassment. My embarrassment changed to lust as Rick just nodded and stood up, peeling off his tight t-shirt and pulling off his shorts to reveal that he was going commando. He settled back in his chair, spread his legs and nodded to me. “OK, Spike, ‘Trick!’”

Spike happily got up and started sniffing and licking up Rick’s leg again, moving up past his knee to where his thickly muscled thigh began. He paused a second to check to make sure I hadn’t changed my mind and then moved up Rick’s meaty thigh to where a nicely engorged cock was growing. Rick was uncut, and Spike got confused for a bit as he watched a different type of cock, but understood what to do after Rick’s head appeared from its skin covering. With a happy grunt Spike zeroed in on Rick’s balls and began licking them with long, slow strokes.

“Umm… oh…” moaned Rick as Spike worked his heavy balls, licking up from the bottom of the ball sack and catching one ball lightly in the cup of his tongue before completing the stroke and going for the other one. The signal to move to the cock was always the presence of precum, and as the first pearly drop appeared at Rick’s cockhead, Spike move forward and began licking the underside of Rick’s hard cock. Of course, Spike had no way of knowing as I did that uncut cocks are very sensitive right there and, like a switch being turned on, my doggie was getting well rewarded in precum as Rick moaned louder and deeper as his cock sent pleasure signals all across his nerves.

Rick moaned louder when Spike’s tongue would scrape lightly against his frenum, the most sensitive spot on men and, for uncut guys, where the biggest trigger was located. That and having a more sensitive head that would receive licks from Spike as he got his precum treat were enough to set off the orgasm and Rick was no exception to the rule. “Oh fuck!” yelled Rick as he began shooting thick cream from his cock, Spike yelping again happily as the man milk began coating Rick’s lap and chest. Spike kept up the work until Rick stopped shooting, and then helpfully licked up every drop of cum that had gone on Rick’s body. Weakly, Rick looked over at me and whispered hoarsely, “Some trick…”

I grinned and motioned to Spike who headed over to where I sat, now naked and throbbing with my own need. “Spike, Trick!” Soon I was moaning and shooting my own load while my doggie lapped up the goods. Seeing neither man with a hard cock, Spike gave one last lick to my crotch and sat at my feet, watching the both of us just in case we were ready for a second round.

Rick got up and came around to my chair, bent close to me and planted a big kiss on my lips. “Ok I think it’s time Master got a chance to have fun with me as well…” I grinned and told Spike to stay, which he did, content (and full of man spunk) to wait until I called again. The two of us headed into Rick’s bedroom and, after collecting a rubber and some lube from a handy side table drawer, Rick was on his back, his ankles resting on my shoulders and my rubberized cock ready to enter his pulsating hole!

I slowly entered him, his moans deepening to groans as I spread his legs wider to get better depth and, when I hit his joy button, his cock leapt up like a startled fish. Long deep strokes slowly moved to the short ‘almost ready to cum’ ones and, with a yelp from Rick, his orgasm began pulsing around my cock, his cock coating his ripped abs and thick pecs with creamy goodness. I was in hog heaven with the feeling on my rod and it didn’t long before I was filling the tip of my rubber to bursting. When I was done I carefully pulled out of Rick’s fine asshole and rolled over onto my back beside my raggedly breathing fuck buddy and then carefully removed the rubber to empty the spunk inside it onto my belly. “Spike, Trick!” With a galloping sound my dog hustled into the bedroom and, nose aquiver, began vacuuming up the spooge on our bodies.

Rick began laughing as Spike happily licked off his cum from his belly, saying that it tickled a bit and, with a little woof Spike continued cleaning of my buddy’s upper torso until he couldn’t find any more. Turning towards me, he cleaned off my belly, carefully licking out the depression where my belly button lay as well as a nice deposit of cum. I agreed with Rick, Spike’s tongue on the belly was rather tickling to the sensitive area right after cumming, and we giggled like two school girls as Spike completed his trick.

We rested, side by side with our hands idly stroking each other as we waited for the post-orgasmic buzz to fade away and when we felt like moving again we got up and showered together, itself creating another post-orgasmic buzz, although this time it was my butthole that was stretched. Poor Spike didn’t get to do his trick this time as the shower cleared off all the spooge before I had a chance to call him into the bathroom. Towels around our waists, we headed to the living room and, with a couple more beers, chatted about not much of anything until Rick suggested I spend the night…

…the next morning, after rounds of heavy sex that left my dog so full of spunk, the last time I called out “Trick” he just hmpfed at me and went back to sleep. Rick and I laughed at that and cleaned ourselves up, had breakfast that morning and then Spike and I went home to prepare for Henry’s stay. A few days later Rick and Henry came over, Henry all excited and sniffing everything in the apartment before we headed to the dog park together. Rick was getting Henry used to my place and that evening he and Henry stayed overnight, Henry confused by Spike performing his trick three times that evening and finally deciding that it was interesting enough to try for himself. I thought Rick’s smile couldn’t get much wider when he realized that his dog had found his crotch and was happily licking up his master’s cum. “Guess I don’t have to do cum rag laundry anymore,” he said, giggling as Henry’s tongue lapped at his belly button, “now I have my own personal spooge vacuum.”

I nodded, Spike cleaning my belly off as well. “Saves a lot of energy and water too.” We both laughed and let the dogs finish before we settled into each other’s arms, slowly falling asleep…

…unfortunately, the next morning Rick had to report for duty and we got up early, Rick taking a quick shower and getting dressed in his reservist’s uniform before eating what he called his last home cooked meal for awhile. Before grabbing his duffel and walking out the door, he stopped and pulled me into a huge bear hug. Kissing me, he whispered, “Thanks, Mike, for not only taking care of Henry for me but also taking care of me. When I get back, I’ll show you how appreciative I am!”

I grinned and rubbed my ass. “Can hardly wait, Rick! Henry, Spike and I will get along fine. You go off and do your duty and when you get back in a few weeks, we’ll have a celebration all ready for you!” Another hug and kiss later, Rick had driven away and the dogs were now resting at my feet while I sat on the couch still tingling from that last kiss.

The weeks rolled by and indeed, the two dogs were good friends and not any problem at all to manage. I developed a bit more muscle in my arms from having to restrain two dogs rather than one, but overall it worked out fine. I reinforced Henry’s newly trained ‘trick’ and Spike had to share the wealth, so to speak, but I knew Henry had received all the training he needed and now was in practice mode, the dogs again got along as long as they shared my cock, balls and spooge.

There were three happy mutts when I heard the knock at the door and Rick stood there, Henry because master was home, Spike because Henry was excited and myself because I had really missed Rick! He laughed as we all tried to hug, lick and rub against him and finally we got ourselves organized on the couch, the two dogs at our feet and the two humans in each other’s arms.

“I’m so glad to be home!” Rick said, smiling into my eyes as we embraced. “It was sheer torture to be without you guys, even for two weeks! I haven’t jacked off or anything as I shared bunk space with five other guys, none of them gay and too ‘uber-straight’ for me.” He grinned and continued, “Besides, my buddy at home and my dog will help me take care of that problem!” We laughed and then we got a bit more purposeful with our hands, finally stripping each other and kissing until we were so horny it was time.

“Spike! Henry! ‘Trick…’!”

"DJs brings in help to review Myer merger

Retailer David Jones will undertake a thorough assessment of a merger proposal put by rival Myer.

David Jones has appointed consultants to help it review the proposal, and identify any benefits for the two retailers.

The review will also assess the benefits of David Jones proceeding on a stand-alone basis.

Nonetheless, the latest statement from David Jones represents a significant shift for the company after it stated last year there would be no fair value to its shareholders in merging with Myer.

David Jones said that, given the Myer proposal was based on a share swap, and if talks between the two companies proceeded, an assessment would be made of Myer's business, requiring Myer's co-operation.

David Jones chairman Gordon Cairns said it was imperative that his company undertook this initial strategic work prior to talks with Myer.

""It will enable us to have a full understanding of the value that can be delivered to our shareholders if David Jones were to merge with Myer, versus the value that can reasonably be expected to be delivered to our shareholders if the company continues with its Future Strategic Direction Plan on a stand-alone basis,"" Mr Cairns said.

""Once this work is completed, we will be in a position to engage in a meaningful way with Myer.""

The latest developments in the proposed merger follow David Jones chief executive Paul Zahra reversing his decision to quit the company, and Myer chief executive Bernie Brookes' re-appointment to his job.

David Jones director Leigh Clapham also ended his role with the company on Tuesday.

He and fellow director Steve Vamos, plus chairman Peter Mason, announced in February they would step down after controversial share purchases by Mr Clapham and Mr Vamos.

Mr Mason and Mr Vamos have already left the company.

Mr Clapham said it had been a privilege to work with David Jones.

""I believe that I have acted in the best interests of the company at all times and it is clearly the right time for me to step down and wish the company well in the implementation of its Future Strategic Direction Plan,"" he said.

David Jones shares gained four cents to $3.33 while Myer shares dropped one cent to $2.65.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"iCADE 8-Bitty to debut at Toy Fair 2012

You know that with the advent of tablets and smartphones, we are now very used to touchscreen displays – something which used to be in the domain of science fiction is now widespread reality. Even our ATMs these days tend to have a touchscreen display in order to keep up with the times. Well, having said that, touchscreen displays do do their part in making sure new genres of games are churned out in order to take advantage of this new interactive format, but what happens when you port over old school games onto a touchscreen display equipped device?

Sure, the memories of yore might roll back the years as you indulge in a little blast from the past on your iPad or smartphone, and I am quite sure that deep down inside, you would probably feel that your gaming experience would have been far better with physical controls instead of just tapping on a glass display. Enter the iCADE 8-Bitty then, which is set to debut at the 2012 Toy Fair in New York City.

Just in case the iCADE 8-Bitty seems familiar to you, it is actually the smaller sibling of the iCADE gaming cabinet, where that itself started off as an April Fool’s joke which ended up as one of the most anticipated ThinkGeek products ever. The iCADE 8-Bitty certainly lives up to that, bringing the magic of the iCADE to the pockets of smartphone and tablet users.

According to Ty Liotta, head of ThinkGeek’s GeekLabs, “We’re excited to extend on the success of the original iCADE. And with millions of iOS and Android devices in circulation it only makes sense to widen the field and bring the fun of iCADE to every possible device.”

The iCADE 8-Bitty functions as a wireless game controller which comes with the classic D-Pad and button layout that will remind you of retro 8-bit game consoles back from the 1980s and 1990s. It is battery powered, and will hook up to your device wirelessly, letting your fingers run all over the fully-functional directional game pad and eight buttons.

"Using a ferocious pass rush that never stopped harassing Rodgers, the Giants pummeled the Green Bay Packers, 38-10, in a Sunday night mauling that was settled by halftime. The Giants showed America why they are still a threat to repeat as Super Bowl champs. They have a great quarterback in Eli Manning, a pressure-tested coach in Tom Coughlin and a knack for playing their best when the lights are the brightest.

The Giants (7-4) will get another chance to shine in prime time next Monday night, when they visit RG3 and the Washington Redskins (5-6). Should they win that game, the Giants will take a major step toward winning the NFC East. Giants outside linebacker Mathias Kiwanuka was already thinking about RG3, who played well in a 27-23 loss to the Giants in October.

“We understand what we have to do in terms of rushing and collapsing the pocket,” Kiwanuka said. “We have to be disciplined. It’s a tough matchup.”

The Packers, who had won five straight, could have been a tough matchup. But the Giants dominated. That’s what happens when the Giants’ pass rush takes over. They sacked Rodgers five times, including a strip-sack by Osi Umenyiora that led to a Giants touchdown.

A relentless pass rush is the best way to slow down a high-octane NFL offense. The San Francisco 49ers did it to Drew Brees on Sunday afternoon. The Giants did it to Rodgers (14-of-25, 219 yards, 1 TD, 1 interception) on Sunday night.

No quarterback enjoys being battered like a pinata, even quarterbacks as good as Rodgers and Brees. Rodgers never found a consistent rhythm because he constantly had Giants like Umenyiora, Kiwanuka (two sacks), Jason Pierre-Paul and Justin Tuck buzzing around him.

“That was something we felt we absolutely had to do with someone with the talent of Aaron Rodgers and having the type of year that he’s having,” Coughlin said. “Have him throw the ball on our timing rather than his.”

Packers coach Mike McCarthy admitted that he changed his play calling in the second half to keep Rodgers from taking more punishment.

“The New York Giants have an outstanding defensive line,” McCarthy said. “We had a plan, and we didn’t execute it very well. They did a hell of a job tonight. They were dynamic, very talented, very productive.

“When your quarterback is under pressure like that, it affected me. I probably didn’t call the best game. You have to protect your quarterback. It’s the No. 1 responsibility of our offense.”

The NFC playoff picture is hard to predict, but the Giants can’t be overlooked. They dominated the 49ers in San Francisco earlier this season. They have beaten the Packers two straight times—Sunday night and in last year’s playoffs. The Giants have proved what they can do when the stakes are high.

For now, they will focus on their next challenge—the Redskins and Griffin. The Giants were impressed with his ability to improvise when they saw him last month. Mobile quarterbacks like Griffin have a better chance to escape the pass rush and make a play when protection breaks down. Rodgers did it a few times Sunday night, but Griffin is even more willing to run and to use his legs to make plays.

Before the bye, the Giants looked lethargic. Perhaps they were tired—a veteran team hitting the dog days of the season and dealing with outside distractions like Hurricane Sandy that affected every player on the team.

Against the Packers, the Giants looked a step faster and focused from the opening kickoff. Manning was sharp, the running game clicked, and it did not take long for the Giants to take control.

Once the Packers fell behind, the Giants ignored Green Bay’s running game and the pass rush took over.

It was a familiar formula for the Giants, but it still works. In today’s pass-happy NFL, getting to the quarterback has never been more important. The Giants can still get to the QB. Which makes them a threat to reach another Super Bowl.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The problem.
The four keys at the bottom of the phone are monitored by a melfas touchkey chip (http://www.melfas.com/english/touch/sensor.asp) that connects to the main processor via an I2C bus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/i2c). The melfas chip generates an interrupt whenever one of the keys is touched or released. The processor then reads the key value from this chip over the i2c bus. The problem is that the touchkey chip is located right next to the 3G antenna. When the phone is accessing the 3G network the RF energy gets transferred to the interrupt and i2c clock and data lines causing false interrupts to occur. The processor responds to the interrupt by reading the key value from the cypress chip. The symptoms occur more frequently in low signal areas because the phone outputs a higher RF level in those situations which causes more RF interference on the interrupt line.

Most of the time when a false interrupt has occurred the touchkey chip will return a value of zero for the key and the driver will recognize this as a bad key press and ignore it. Sometimes the RF interference on the i2c clock and/or data line causes a valid value to be returned and the driver reports a key press value to the application. In the case where the driver reports a Ďbackí key down, the software sees this as holding the back key down so when you press the power button you get a screen shot. The easiest way to cure this is to always press and release the back key before pushing the power button. This causes the software to see both a key down and key up event which cancels the screenshot mode.

This RFI induced touchkey interrupt happens hundreds of times per second when the phone is using 3G. It produces lots of different symptoms including applications that always seem to shut down. A wide variety of problems can be attributed to this failure. In addition, the processor spends a lot of time servicing these bogus interrupts, which take cpu time away from the other applications. This can make the phone appear to be slow or even freeze up for short periods of time. Thereís a good chance that most people have experience this to some degree without realizing the root cause.

Solution one. Fix the driver.

Since this is a true hardware failure, a software solution is going to be less than perfect. After dozens of experiments rewriting the interrupt service routines in the driver Iíve settled on a combination of fixes. The first is to re-test the interrupt input line several times. In normal operation when you touch or release a button, the touchkey chip drives the interrupt line low and keeps it low until the driver reads data over the i2c interface. Since the RF interference is a sine wave and is being sampled it causes the interrupt line to go high and low at a fast rate. Sampling the line multiple times in software increases the chance of finding it in the high state. This is done both in the interrupt handler and then again in the interrupt thread. About 90% of the false interrupts are filtered out by testing the line in the handler. If the interrupt handler doesnít find the line high after 10 samples, it masks the interrupt so that another falling edge doesnít produce another interrupt. In testing Iíve noticed that the interrupt handler would run multiple times before the interrupt thread was even called. Once in a while, so many interrupts would get stacked up that the phone would just reboot. It was probably a stack or buffer overflow that wasnít being handled. Remember, this interrupt would happen many hundreds of times a second. About 90% of the remaining false interrupts are filtered out by sampling this line in the thread. That leaves about 1% of the interrupts that need to be further tested. The second test is to read the data from the chip and discard anything that isnít a valid key press value. This is easily done with a case statement. Finally, since occasionally a bogus valid value will get through, I set up a timer so that any key down event that doesnít have a corresponding key up event within 3 seconds is canceled by calling the all_keys_up routine.

This combination all but eliminates the symptoms produced by this failure. The only draw back is that the processor still spends a considerable amount of time servicing the false interrupts. And rarely a phantom keypress does get through. In all, itís a fairly good piece of duct tape and JB Weld.

During my experiments I used a copy of the kgb kernel. My version with the modified driver is in github at https://github.com/dmriley/kgb. If you want to try this yourself, be sure to use the Ďdeví branch.

Solution two. Fix the hardware.

There are three signals that connect from the melfas touchkey chip to the processor. They are the two i2c lines: sdc which is the clock and sda which is the data. The third line is the interrupt. In troubleshooting this problem, I took my phone apart and put oscilloscope probes on the three lines. This allowed me to see the real cause of the problem. Since the interference is RFI (or EMI) the only real way to fix the problem is to either remove the RF or make the impedance of the signals much lower. Removing the RF is easy if you donít need to use 3G. When the phone is using wifi (or no network connectivity at all) the problem does not exist. Also, when you are very close to a cell tower, the phone transmits at a much lower level. This lower level greatly reduces the RFI. Lowering the impedance is a little harder. I2C uses active pull down and passive pull up for the logic levels for both sda and sdc. This means that the impendence is mostly governed by the pull up resistor. This resistor value is typically upwards of 1kohm and probably as high as 3kohms (I didnít measure it in this phone). Since the impedance only needs to be lowered for the 3G frequencies of around 800MHz, a capacitor can be added from the signal source to signal ground. At 800MHZ a 100 pf cap is about 2 ohms (1/ 2*pi*f*c). Thatís a couple of orders of magnitude lower than the pull up resistor alone, and much too low for the RF signal to induce any significant voltage on the line. This value is also low enough not to interfere with the signal rise and fall times for the interrupt line. In the case of the interrupt line, the melfas chip drives the signal low and keeps it low until the interrupt is serviced. Discharging a 100pf cap with a 2mA driver takes only microseconds. This much delay is not noticeable when touching the key and is much less than the amount of time that the processor takes to service the interrupt.

Adding the cap to the interrupt line eliminates false interrupts. A chance does exist that a valid key event during 3G access could cause an incorrect key value to be returned due to RFI on the clock and data lines. The i2c protocol is designed to compensate for capacitive loading on the lines. Although it would cause the clock period to be stretched out significantly it would still only take milliseconds to read the key data from the chip. The difference would be imperceptible. To date I have only added the cap to the interrupt line and have yet to experience an invalid key press.

Iíll post pictures of cap mod.

Summary.

Most people will be satisfied using the software fix. I think that a couple of the kernel devs are incorporating some or most of the driver mods outlined in this document. Both comradesven (kgb dev) and ssewk2x aka Efpophis (glitch dev) were involved in the test and debug process. Much appreciation is given to both of them for the help that they gave me and for allowing me to use and hack up their code on github. Efpophis saved me hours of searching through code. Without their help, Iíd still be unable to build a kernel.

UPDATE:30 Mar 2012
The phone had been working fine since the mod. I hadn't seen a screen capture or any of the other symptoms. Then, a couple of nights ago, while I running maps on 3G (a data intensive app) the touchkey backlights started flashing rapidly like the phone was having a little seizure. And then it happened, the voice search popped up. A couple of debug kernels later I've come to the conclusion (and I'm never wrong) that the clock line (SCL) going to the melfas chip was being toggled by the same RF interference that was causing the false interrupts. A random clock along with random data was causing the chip to turn the backlights on and off as well as generate a false interrupt. I was able to reliably duplicate the problem in a couple of really low signal level areas (not hard to find when you live out in the boonies).

I tore the phone apart (again) today and added a 100pf cap to the scl line right next to the chip. I also added another cap in parallel with the 100pf on the interrupt line. I spent about 1/2 hour tonight running 3G data apps in the same location where the problem first appeared. So far, no problems and none of the debug messages have shown up on dmesg.

Wow, we're lucky to have someone as capable as yourself figure out this annoying issue! I've kinda kept up on your work, but seeing this breakdown and the photos is helpful in understanding the root cause of the problem. I do wonder sometimes how Samsung missed this issue in their testing, but at least we have custom kernels that implement your fixes and dramatically reduce the phantom presses!

wasn't just me. had help from other members here. I didn't even know where to start looking when I first started. It's so cool that people are willing to do the level of work that the devs here do without expecting anything back.

Thanks so much for all the work, and the detail in your post. It is amazing the work everybody does here and the knowledge you pass on to us.
I do have a few questions

Would you mind sharing what kind off iron you used? is that the most bottom line on the board you soldered to? If so, did you have to scratch it or something first? Is it the farthest left line on the chip that was used? Do they make caps that size with leads coming of the 2 sides, and if so would that be a easier mod? Is there a positive and negative side to that capacitor?

I'm really thinking about doing this, if i decide to would you mind sending me 5 of your extra caps for a $10 donation?

Alejandro (*****)There is no ""bait & switch"". Just a single man who made a great app for free, decided to make it trial, then ad supported FOR his users. Support him.

Christopher (*)I'm so sick of the ads coming back and having to backup my database, uninstall, reinstall, restore database. For this kind of money, it should work.

Jerry (*****)Would be cool if you could add a custom field where you could enter a catalog# for each dvd

Emma (****)Glad I noticed the new update. It's back to being best app ever ;-)

maotx (*)Bait and switch. Price to high. No integration with other services. No way to customize shelves. Can only backup one category at a time.

Real (*)No manual entry. High asking price with still no access to amazon db. Scan couldn't identify canadian upc.

Sean Mc. (****)If the app wasn't so good, I would have uninstalled it due to the bait and switch tactics. Price should be determined before it goes to market.

Randall (****)Garen Torikian has more than once personally responded to questions as well as quickly made desired improvements. I fully support his need to charge!

Job Fair – Round One

So today I ventured out to a new experience, one that I had heard a lot about but not experienced – the job fair. So this morning I got up and put on my Sunday best and headed out to a school and into the dog pen. I got here, along with a lot of other people, a little early and got registered. Then I stood in line and waited, and waited, and waited some more for the doors to open. Then finally they did and all of us, I would have to guess somewhere around 550 teachers, educators, and support staff all searching for a job.

So there I was, a student teacher thrown into a huge gym full of people. Armed with my resume and a smile I approached my first school district to talk to them. Of course there were lines, but some places were worse than others. Last night I made my short list of schools that I was interested in, so I started off there. The format is that prospective educators have about two minutes to impress the representatives of the district with the few words and ideas that you have. So that’s what I did, I said a few things about student teaching, technology, finishing my degree program, and then trying to ask a question to keep the conversation going. From there they would probably tell me, at least at most places, that they do not have any openings right now. So I would hand them my resume, tell them thank you, and then move on.

That’s what I found in a lot of districts, but in just a few I had a little more luck. If you make it past the first round of interrogation and approval, then they grant you a thirty minute interview later in the day. At first I started to wonder if I would even get any interviews. I kept getting turned down by school district after school district, because of a lack of openings. As I was waiting in line I met a friend who chatted with me for a while and then she encouraged me to throw my plan out the window. My short list, what did it really matter? Of course, make sure that I hit those schools, but other than that I have nothing holding me to Denver. Why not go around to every table and get my information out. So that’s what I did, I hit them all up. Mostly I got turned down, time and time again. One school district in particular would not even look at student teachers. Which, I think is good for the students and parents in their district, but some student teachers are fantastic and I think worth looking at – I am included. However, I guess I somewhat understand the policy. That was frustrating; however this market is hard. The jobs are few and far between, so I kept trying. Then I finally got a huge break with a large district outside of Denver and that made me really excited. From there I tried a few other places and then started getting the line, “We would love to interview you today, but our sheet is already filled up.” They only have so much time to interview so many candidates, it makes sense, but I feel like they fill them on a first come, first serve basis, which I believe they are leaving out some quality candidates. I was excited, though, because even one school district told me, “We’re really interested and if anything opens up today, like someone does not show up for an interview, I will call you.” That was really nice to hear. In addition, I also got an interview at a smaller district that will serve as a preparation for the larger school district. I was able to schedule it right before too, so that was a good thing.

All in all, there were a lot of people, a lot of standing in line, and very little progress. A few interviews, that was good, but overall I’m still not ready for school on Monday and this ate up my day. I understand that finding a job is really important, but I want to make sure that it is worth my time. Many of these districts were like, did you apply online? To which I thought; No, if I had time I might take you up on that. Which leads me to the kicker – It will be this week when I carve out time for me to actually get on the computer and actually get things situated. I am watching a few other school districts and a few other jobs around the state and this week I have to make time to start applying.

So my first interview was with the really small school district. It was good to go in there, see what questions they had, and then move from there. They strongly encouraged me to apply to their open position.

My second interview was with an interviewee that was really excited to meet me and interview me. My interviewer was really impressed with my resume and “everything I had done in my short life.” She said, “It was one of the best resumes I have seen in a while,” which made me feel good about my accomplishments and that my resume was attracting attention. From there she asked me a few standard questions about education, teaching, and then she asked me about publishing relevant material. I took that and ran with it. I showed her how my students were publishing to Wiki spaces, blogging, Fishbowling in class, and really publishing to the world. I also told her about how we are using cell phones in the classroom and really trying to make the content that the students write worth while to the students and publishable to the world. From question three on, I do not think she went back to the “prepared questions.” Instead, we just had a chat about engagement, technology, teaching, and middle school students. At the end of the interview, my interviewer strongly encouraged me to apply for a recent posting of an opening at 7th and 8th grade. I was a little hesitant at first to even think about and acknowledge teaching middle school students, but then my interviewer told me a little bit more about the school district and how it is growing and how it passed a very large bond last year. To that end, they will be hiring many teachers and spending a lot of money on technology and a brand new P-20 school that will open in 2011 I believe. So it was a great interview that actually went over time, but made me excited for teaching and the prospect of a job in the near future.

This whole career fair thing is very daunting at first and even seemed like part of it was not worth it, but I really felt that at the end of the day I had two good jobs to look into and start applying to. I had built up confidence in my skills, resume, and presentation, which all was very helpful, and I had even had some interview experience. Now off to the search for the online applications and the time to fill them out. The search continues, but all in all it was a good day.

"Very well, this is not the first story that I write in English, but is the first that is going to be published and NOT removed

Very well, this is not the first story that I
write in English, but is the first that is going to be published
and WONT be removed. So I'll be so honored if you read it even if
it's not perfect, and what's more: you can even personal message
me if you want to correct it, then, you can put your mail and be sure
that no one but me is going to see it. Then I can send you the
chapters or the story, 'because I actually don't know if it's
going to be a long one shot or a novel. I guess that's something
I'll have to see as I write the story.

Not an
orphan.

Chapter
1

I'm not an orphan; I think you already got that
right? I have a Mum and had a Dad. Though I have no idea were exactly
my mum is, I know that wherever she is she
is working for our goodness (yes our: my sister Lucy and me, Sara)
and that she is deeply in love with us.

Or at
least, that's what Grandma' tells us every day. She is very poor
and bit old, but again, she works hard for our goodness and she loves
us deeply, as does her friend Mónica.

Well, as
I said, I'm Sara, I'm 17 and there's nothing more you would
actually like to know apart of the fact that my father died the day
before yesterday.

He, a man
of hard working fell ill the past month and it was that strange
illness what actually finished him.

He didn't own much money, and all he had was
left for education and food mainly, so that's why he was so full of
debts when he died. And as it's easy to figure out, my family is
now in complete ruin, more than it was before, and yes, I had the
opportunity to study in a quite good school, but now things have
changed and the only way out of this is for my Grandma' to do as my
mother and try to make it better somewhere out the country, maybe in
USA, where I was born. That's why I speak in English, even if it's
hard for me to do it, 'cause I've lived almost my whole life here
in Colombia.

Unfortunately,
we can't go with her, 'cause as I say before, there's no money
and she can't stay, 'cause she may be picked by the police
because of my father's debts. But she may travel to USA searching
for some help 'cause, again, my family is American.

As we
haven't got any more family in the entire world, there's nothing
left but go to an orphanage, to a good one we've been told. In
there, we'll have food, a roof, and (as my father would have liked)
a good education.

We're
on our way right now, but you shouldn't feel sad for us, because is
better than going to a bad school and living in the streets.

It would
be so dangerous for us to sleep in the streets, I know! For everyone
is dangerous, but more for kids in Colombia, and what's more: if
they have USA blood (for this effects, like it or not, capitalist
blood).

Back to
us, we're on our way, in a bus, and can't help myself but spend
my time watching the awesome landscape. It's full of hills and
mountains nicely decorated by trees and bushes.

The bus
zigzags its way through the road. Lucy is sleeping next to me. I'm
thinking about my friends back at my other school that had to leave
in mid term.

I also think about the boy I like, he's called
Sebastian, but I guess he doesn't sees me as more than friends. And
very apart friends I have to say! He is one of those people I didn't
tell I was leaving. I guess I won't care. Any ways, it's
something I'll have to forget because there's no go back at least
for a while.

I'm
suppose to leave the orphanage next year, but I don't reckon I'll
do, 'cause I just can't leave Lucy alone. She is only 5 and I
don't want her to forget me, or our family, or worst: forget she
HAS a family.

I still
have my MP3 (I know, I know it's something old, but remember I'm
not a powerful money owner) and my cell phone, but can't know if
they're going to take it off from me. I'll do my best so that it
doesn't happen, really, I'm so a no one without my music or my
cell phone.

I stand up a bit to get a bit more comfortable.
The bus is passing beneath some tall trees and its shadow feels fine
in my skin.

Lucy
wakes up and sits straight.

""Were
are we going Sara?""

I have told her a thousand times we're going to
a new home. But I guess she doesn't get the idea of what a new home
is. 'Cause I guess you know, but a
different home is not the same as a different house. At least, not
this case.

This time, we're going to have a new house, it's
true, but more important is the fact that
we're going to have a new 'family' if that's how you can call
an orphan.

""We're
going to a new home?""

""A new
house?""

I nodded;
I guess that's just too hard for a small kid to understand the
difference between those two concepts.

""And""
she proceeded ""Is it to far?""

""I
don't know Lucy"" I look through the window ""I don't know""

The bus
keeps going in its way, the humming noise doesn't stop. And things
in my head began to change. I guess is because things are really
going to change from no on. How can I possibly know how the future is
going to be like?

--

And there
it is! My very first chapter of my very first English fiction press.

I know! It's short, but is just the beginning.

Anyways. Remember I said I didn't know if it was
going to be a story or a novel? Well, it's going to be a novel
(here again, I think that you may already noticed that ¬¬), but a
short novel I guess, no more than six chapters. Anyways: Who knows?
If it really gets good, things can possibly change.

I'd like to know how you feel about it: If you
liked it, if you didn't, If you think I'd better continue writing
some pokemon fanfiction, or whatever you'd like to say, it can even
not be related to the story at all, just REVIEW!

But try
to make it according to the story anyways please…

The author would like to thank you for your continued support. Your review has been posted.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Is SXC Health Overtaking RIM as Canada’s Biggest Tech Success Story?

SXC Health CEO Mark Thierer on CNBC's Powerlunch. Under Thierer, SXC revenue has grown from under $100 million to $5 billion.

We’ll forgive you if haven’t yet heard their name. After all, as late as 2004 this Milton, Ontario company was plodding along more than a decade after it was founded with just $33 million in revenue. There was no big, splashy Bay Street IPO; the company went public in a reverse takeover of a publicly listed shell, allowing it to raise a relatively meager $10 million in 1997.

In February, however, SXC Health (TSX:SXC) reported its fiscal 2011 results and the numbers surprised even its most ardent supporters. SXC’s revenue grew a whopping 155% to $5 billion, from $1.9 billion in 2010. Earnings were up too, increasing 45% to $166.4 million.

This story is brought to you by Serenic (TSXV:SER). Serenic’s market cap of $3.18 million (as of January 27th, 2012) was less than its cash position of $4.03 million (as of Q2, 2012). The company has no debt. Click here for more information.

SXC Health, alongside US-based companies such as Medco and Caremark, is a leader in the Pharmacy Benefit Management space. PBM’s process and pay prescription drug claims and act as an intermediary between the health care system and the claimant. The space has grown rapidly; today more than more than 210 million Americans receive drug benefits administered by PBMs. With today’s $4.4-billion acquisition of Catalyst Health, SXC has vaulted itself into the arena of the big boys. On BNN today, Versant analyst Tom Liston said, with SXC acquiring $299-million in EBITDA next year, the Catalyst Health deal is “transformational”.

For many observers of Canadian tech, the timing of SXC’s rise couldn’t be better. 2011 was, without doubt, Research in Motion’s worst year. The company’s entry into the tablet space, The BlackBerry PlayBook, was widely regarded as a flop, and RIM continued to lose market share in the mobile device sector.

RIM’s current problems are well documented. But between 2008 and fiscal 2011 the company’s revenue more than tripled; from $6 billion to $19.9 billion. In 2012, however, RIM’s revenue growth has completely stalled; nine months revenue was down to $14.24 billion from $14.35 billion a year prior. Even more concerning is the fact that gross margins are eroding, from 44.4% in 2011 to 36.3%.

The space between SXC’s $5 billion in revenue and RIM’s near $20 billion is a wide chasm. But with RIM’s future looking uncertain in a increasingly competitive space, the gap may tighten quickly. Before today’s deal, Versant analyst Tom Liston thought SXC’s revenue will grow to $8.2 billion in fiscal 2013. SXC is the Versant analyst’s top pick, and the stock he says is simply a “must own”.

But is there there room in the Pharmacy Benefit Management space for SXC to continue its torrid growth? In 2010, CEO Mark Thierer told Cantech Letter’s Nick Waddell that he believes there are still “great growth opportunities within the U.S. market for SXC…” and that the company would not have necessarily have to look outside the US anytime soon because “…approximately 40 percent of the worldwide pharmaceutical sales, the EU 35 percent and the rest of the world is the remainder.”

And although SXC most direct competitors are not as vertically aligned as SXC, their numbers dwarf even RIM’s topline. Medco’s fiscal 2011 revenues increased 6.2% to a record $70.1 billion. With 2011 revenues of $107 billion, CVS Caremark is even bigger.

While the slide of RIM’s share price has perhaps been disproportionate to the slide in its business fortunes, shareholders are continuing to gain confidence in SXC Health’s stunning rise, which began through the recession of 2008 and hasn’t stopped. On March 14, 2008 shares of SXC on the NASDAQ could be had for $5.22. At press time, SXC was trading, on the TSX, at $85.58.

"Fort Bragg soldier dies in Afghanistan

The military said Thursday that a Fort Bragg Soldier with the 44th Medical Command died in Afghanistan Dec. 29.

Staff Sgt. Ronald Jay Spino, 45, from Waterbury, Connecticut was assigned to the 274th Forward Surgical Team (Airborne) as a licensed practical nurse.

Officials said Spino was shot while unloading medical supplies in Bala Morghab, village in Badghis Province in northwestern Afghanistan. The incident is under investigation.

""Staff Sergeant Spino was a hardworking, diligent airborne combat medic,” said Col. Scott Putzier, chief of staff, 44th Medical Command. “For those who knew and worked with him, we will remember him as a dedication non-commissioned officer. He was quiet, so when he spoke, everyone listened and were often caught off guard by his sense of humor … he was really funny.”

Spino deployed with his unit to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in February, and was re-missioned to Afghanistan in November.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"I have configured my PayPal account in my Magento website. But even after I publish my website, there were no orders placed. Now I recieved an order from the website, but there is no money transfer to my PayPal account.

In your Magento admin, go to System -> Paypal. Check to see if ""Sandbox mode"" is activated in the Payment System you are using.

You can set up Magento and Paypal to work fairly seamlessly together. The easiest is probably to use the Paypal API. Log into your Paypal account and obtain the API username, password and signature, then just copy & paste those into the corresponding fields in the Magento admin.

You can test this by setting up a developer account in Paypal Sandbox. It is a bit difficult to get used to at first, but basically the steps are as follows:

Create a Seller test account. This is a simulated merchant account that will act as the payment receiver.

Create a Buyer test account. This is the simulated customer account that you will use to make test purchases in your store.

Note that you have to create email addresses for each of these accounts. They do not correspond to any real email accounts, and the mail you receive in these is always checked from within the Paypal Sandbox.

Once you have these test accounts, you sign into them from within the Paypal Sandbox. So you would sign into your test Seller account, get the API data mentioned above, and paste it into your Magento admin. (Be sure to set Sandbox mode to ""true"" in Magento when you are trying this).

In order to be able to make test purchases, you have to be signed into the Paypal Sandbox and have it open in the browser. Note that nobody else will be able to make actual orders through Paypal while you are in Sandbox mode.

You can then go to the public area of your store and purchases using the test Buyer account. If everything goes well, you will be able to see your fake orders placed and registred in the Magento admin area.

As a final note, I recommend having a preproduction version of your store for doing this kind of testing. This means setting up an exact copy of your Magento store (with a recent copy of the database) on another domain and activating it when you are doing testing.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

What is Methadone ?

Methadone is a long-acting synthetic narcotic, used primarily in the treatment of opiate addiction. It suppresses withdrawal symptoms, allowing methadone patients to lead normal lives.With innumerable successes over the past 40 years, methadone maintenance is recognized by the medical community as the most successful way of treating people addicted to opiates.

How to use Methadone Safely:

U.S. Department of Health & Human ServicesSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - Food and Drug Administration Methadone provides relief for patients who do not respond to non-narcotic pain medicines and has also been used for decades to treat individuals who suffer from addiction and dependence on heroin and narcotic pain medicines. When taken as prescribed, methadone is safe and effective. But all medicines have risks. Patients and healthcare providers need to understand the power and physical effects of methadone in order to get the maximum benefits.A Proven Road to ReliefWhether known by Dolophine, Methadose or its generic name, methadone has provided relief to millions of patients. Methadone works by changing how the brain and nervous system respond to pain. It is also used in drug detoxification and treatment programs to lessen the symptoms of withdrawal and to block the effects of opiate drugs. Methadone allows individuals to recover from their addiction and to reclaim active and meaningful lives. Patients being treated for pain generally receive a prescription from their doctor and take the medication at home. Patients taking methadone for addiction receive their doses at accredited programs under supervision. After a period of stability, these patients are given methadone to take at home between program visits. In all cases, if not taken correctly, methadone can be dangerous.The Dangers of Overdose Pain relief from a dose of methadone lasts about four to eight hours. But there are big differences in how each patient reacts to methadone. Even after the pain relief effects wear off, methadone remains in the body for much longer. Taking more methadone to relieve the pain can cause unintentional overdose.

Navigate the Risks:

Two Simple Steps 1. Take Methadone exactly as prescribed. To be safe, people must take only the dose prescribed, at the times prescribed. Methadone can build up in the body to a toxic level if taken too often, if the dose is too high, or if it is taken with certain other medicines or supplements.

2. Know—and share—your complete health history. People who take methadone need to give health professionals every detail of what they are taking. This is especially important for a firsttime user of methadone. A long list of medications can interact with methadone:

Methadone may be more hazardous when used with alcohol, other opioids (opium-like substances) or illicit drugs that depress the central nervous system.

Be especially careful about other medicines that may make you sleepy, such as other pain medicines, antidepressant medicines, sleeping pills, anxiety medicines, antihistamines, or tranquilizers.

Other medicines to watch out for include diuretics, antibiotics, heart or blood pressure medication, HIV medicines and MAO inhibitors.

If you are taking medicine that may cause disruptions in your heartbeat (known as arrhythmias), you should be especially cautious taking methadone.

Even if a medication is not on this list, it could still be dangerous.

Older adults and people with debilitating conditions may be more sensitive to methadone's effects. To avoid danger, people should tell health professionals about any illnesses or conditions. Here are just a few that doctors must know about:

A history of drug or alcohol addiction

Pregnancy and nursing (current or planned)

Seizure disorders, such as epilepsy

Cardiac conditions such as low blood pressure or long QT syndrome (racing heart)

Use Methadone only as directed:

Methadone can be addictive. Patients should take care not to abuse it.

Never use more methadone than the amount prescribed.

If you miss a dose or if you feel it is not working, do not take extra. For pain management patients, take only the recommended dose at the recommended time. For patients in methadone maintenance treatment for addiction, contact your clinic for instructions.

No one should use methadone if it has not been prescribed for them.

Be especially careful if taking methadone for the first time.

When Taking Methadone:

Do not consume alcohol or medicines that contain alcohol.

Be careful when driving, operating heavy machinery or doing anything that requires you to be alert. Methadone, like many other medications, can slow thinking and reaction time and make you drowsy.

Store methadone at room temperature and away from light.

Always take methadone in the exact dosage amount and form you have been prescribed.

Take steps to prevent children from accidentally taking methadone.

Never give methadone to anyone else even if the person has similar symptoms or suffers from the same condition as you because it can be dangerous.

Dispose of unused methadone by flushing it down the toilet.

Suddenly stopping or going off methadone treatment can be dangerous. Patients should talk to their doctors first. To minimize withdrawal symptoms, health professionals can work out a plan to gradually reduce the medication.

Take Side Effects Seriously:

Some side effects are emergencies. Patients should contact a physician or emergency services right away—if they:

Have difficulty breathing or shallow breathing

Feel light-headed or faint

Get hives or a rash; have swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat

Feel chest pain

Have a fast or pounding heartbeat

Have hallucinations or confusion

Make sure your family members and members of your household know what symptoms to look for, especially signs of shallow breathing or loud snoring.

Other side effects are not life threatening, but can still be cause for concern.Patients should immediately talk to health professionals if they have: severe or persistent nausea, vomiting, constipation, loss of appetite, weight gain, stomach pain, sweating, mood changes, vision problems, flush or red skin, sleep difficulties, decreased sexual desire or ability or missed menstrual periods.

Feel Lost? Here's Help Patients who develop a problem with methadone or have questions should speak with a physician or contact 1-800-662-HELP.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Swaziland police have
said they will decide who can and who cannot take part in May Day
celebrations on Friday.

According to them only ‘recognised’ workers
unions will be allowed to take part.

This is seen as a deliberate snub to the
Trade Union Congress of Swaziland (TUCOSWA), the labour federation that has organized
a rally in Manzini, the major commercial city in the kingdom, for Friday (1 May
2015).

After a long and continuing dispute with
the Swaziland state, TUCOSWA is not registered as a recognised federation in
the kingdom ruled by King Mswati III, sub-Saharan Africa’s last absolute
monarch.

In Swaziland all political parties are
banned from taking part in elections and organisations that advocate for
democracy have been outlawed as ‘terrorist’ organisations under the Suppression
of Terrorism Act.

In a statement
to media, Police Information and Communications Officer Assistant
Superintendent Khulani Mamba said only recognised unions would be allowed to
celebrate the Workers Day.

He added, ‘Having said this, as a police
service, we wish to point out as previously stated, that we will be present at
the celebrations for the purpose of making sure that law and order is
maintained. However, this is on the premise and understanding that the Labour
Day is to be commemorated by recognised workers’ unions in the country,’ Mamba
said.

Previously, Mamba had told media since May
Day was an internationally recognised day police would not hinder the
celebrations by workers but they would arrest people who uttered ‘defamatory
statements about authorities’.

As workers and pro-democracy activists prepare to
mark Workers’ Day on Friday (1 May 2015) many will remember Sipho Jele who was
killed by Swaziland state forces five years ago.

The 35-year-old Jele was arrested and charged under
the Suppression of Terrorism Act on 1 May 2010 for wearing a T-shirt supporting
the People’s United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO),
an organisation banned in the kingdom, ruled by King Mswati, sub-Saharan
Africa’s last absolute monarch.

He was taken to Manzini Police Station and then to Sidwashini
Remand Correctional Institution. He was found hanging from a beam in a shower
block on 3 May.

The inquest
verdict delivered in March 2011 said in effect that Jele levitated
to the ceiling unaided, tied an old piece of blanket around a beam and then
around his own neck and then allowed himself to fall to the ground, thereby
killing himself by hanging.

Coroner Nondumiso Simelane reported, ‘Further,
although there was nothing found at the scene which the deceased could have
used as a platform on which to stand to commit the suicide; upon closer examination
of the scene and the photos of the deceased captured at the scene, and the
pathologists concluding that “it is possible for the deceased to have mounted
himself upwards from the floor and then suspended himself without the use of a
platform,” and that “after the ligature was applied to the beam and neck he
could have lowered himself and the feet would still be above the floor.”

According to
a report in the Swazi
News, an independent newspaper in Swaziland, Perumal said, ‘In this case
there is no evidence of being hung. The perplexing thing is how he got
suspended as there was no object on which he stood. In most cases the object is
kicked away for the body to remain suspended. There was no such object that was
found. That is the only feature that doesn’t confirm suicide. It is an enigma
how he hung without standing on an object.’

Questioned by attorney Leo Gama on whether it was
possible that Jele had tied the rope around his neck while seated on the beam
he was found hanging from, and then threw himself down for the rope to tighten
around his neck, Dr Perumal entirely ruled out this possibility.

‘In that case there would be stretching of the skin
and moreover there would be problem with the spine. Looking at the findings, we
can exclude that scenario. There are no features to suggest that,’ he said.

It emerged at the inquest that Swazi police and
prison warders lied
a number of times about the circumstances up to the time
of the death. They had claimed that they interviewed people who were in the
same cell as Jele about the circumstances of his death; Perumal told the
inquest that the cell mates denied being interviewed.

Perumal said, ‘I asked if any of the inmates had
been interviewed to see if they had seen him and if any fight had ensued during
the night of his death but none had been interviewed.’

This was not the first time that the police had been
found out lying to the inquest. Previously,
it was discovered that police had recorded in an official journal that Jele was
in good health when he arrived at Manzini police station.

The official record – called the RSP 3 book – said
the entry was made by Constable David Tsabedze, but he told the inquest that he
never made the entry.

This led to Attorney Leo Gama concluding that
Tsabedze never
made such entries and left the space vacant, but when the
police heard that there was to be an inquest into the matter, someone filled up
those spaces without telling Tsabedze. This was so they could show Jele was in
good health when he left the police station.

Another anomaly was that although Jele was brought
to the police station at 5.30pm on 1 May, he was only placed in a police cell
at 11pm and no one could come forward to state what happened in the meantime.

In a bizarre twist the inquest heard that Jele asked
to be sent to Sidwashini because he feared being ‘tubed’ (tortured and
suffocated) if he was sent back to police custody. The Swaziland Director of
Public Prosecutions Mumcy
Dlamini said she was pleased to hear this because
it meant Jele had not yet been tortured while at the police station. Dlamini
told the inquest as far as she knew the only reason why Jele wanted to go to
Sidvwashini was his fear of torture by police.

The
inquest was told Jele was taken out of the Manzini Police Station’s cell for
interrogation purposes for hours on different occasions, but one officer said
it was unclear whether they also took him out of the building.

A
jailor, Assistant Superintendent Richard Mthukutheli Fakudze,told the inquest he found Jele hanging
from a concrete bar in the bathroom of his prison cell at about 5am on 3 May
and he just knew Jele had killed himself. While he gave his testimony, he was
interrupted by Prosecutor Phila Dlamini who warned him to only say what he
observed and desist from giving an opinion. Fakudze had conclusively said Jele
hanged himself yet he found him hanging. Said Dlamini, ‘If you insist that he
hanged himself, you are actually saying that you saw him tying the blanket
around his neck and hanging himself.’

Jele
was charged under S19 (1) (a) of the Suppression of terrorism Act for wearing a
T-shirt with PUDEMO written on it.

S19
(1) (a) of the STA states, ‘A person who is a member of a terrorist group
commits an offence and shall on conviction, be liable to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding ten (10) years.’

Wearing
a PUDEMO T-Shirt does not make you a member of PUDEMO and therefore the police
had no reason to arrest Jele. But after police arrested him they then took him
to his home
and searched it and later alleged they had found
materials linking him to the banned political organisation.

Amnesty International suspected that Jele might have
been targeted for arrest at the May Day rally. Jele was one of 16 prodemocracy
activists awaiting trial after they were charged with treason in 2005.

In
a public statement, Amnesty said, ‘Mr Jele had been subjected to torture and
other ill-treatment in police custody in the past. He was detained by police in
December 2005 and subsequently charged with treason along with 15 others. Mr
Jele alleged that while in custody he was beaten around the head causing
long-term damage to his hearing, for which Amnesty International was able to
obtain independent medical corroboration. He also alleged that he was subjected
to suffocation torture while forcibly held down on a bench by six police
officers at Sigodvweni police station. Some of his co-defendants made similar
allegations of torture by the police.

‘The
presiding High Court judge hearing their bail application in March 2006 was
sufficiently concerned to call on the government to establish an independent
inquiry into their claims. An inquiry was established under a single
commissioner who subsequently reported his findings to the then Prime Minister.
To Amnesty International’s knowledge this inquiry report was never made public.
Mr Jele and his co-defendants had still not been brought to trial on the
treason charge by the time of his death.’

At
the time of Jele’s death, PUDEMO
said in a statement, ‘The Swaziland royal regime has always
been giving the international community the wrong information that political
dissenters are not imprisoned, harassed and killed. And that Swaziland is a
peaceful country. But here is a political activist getting killed for attending
Workers Day and wearing a PUDEMO T-shirt.’

It is hard to believe the police in Swaziland are serious
in their intent to get the kingdom’s Chief Justice Michael Ramodibedi to leave
the house he has been holed up in for 11 days after a
warrant was issued for his arrest.

Ramodibedi who is in his luxury mansion in Mbabane
with his wife and two adult children was allowed to send one of his sons out
for food last Friday (24 April 2015) and it was reported that on Wednesday
(28 April 2015) his
maid delivered food to the family.

Ramodibedi, a native of Lesotho, reportedly faces
23 charges, including abuse of power.

Two High Court Judges, Mpendulo Simelane and Jacobus
Annandale, and the High Court Registrar, Fikile Nhlabatsi, have
also been charged in connection with Ramodibedi’s case. They have appeared
in court and been bailed.

The Times
of Swaziland, the only independent daily newspaper in the kingdom ruled
by King Mswati III, sub-Saharan Africa’s last absolute monarch, reported on
Wednesday, ‘The movement, with ease, of some members of the CJ’s family in and
out of his residence has left journalists wondering why the police were not
using such opportunities to enter the house and arrest the CJ.’

Police Information and Communications Officer
Assistant Superintendent Khulani Mamba told the newspaper they were still
waiting for negotiations between, Lesotho and Swaziland, to be concluded.

It is not known who is negotiating and about what.

Police officers have been camping outside the CJ’s
house since Friday 17 April 2015. They said they would arrest Ramodibedi as
soon as he came out of the house. There has been no attempt to enter the house
forcibly, despite the comings-and-goings of people from the house.

The lack of action by the police is unusual. They
have a deserved reputation for smashing their way into the homes of pro-democracy
activists, often without warrants.

There is speculation within Swaziland and on social
media about the reasoning for the delay in effecting the arrest warrant. On
Sunday (26 April 2015), the Times
Sunday, an independent newspaper in the kingdom, speculated that Ramodibedi
was waiting until King Mswati returned to Swaziland from a trip to the Bandung
Conference for Asian and African countries.

The newspaper
reported, ‘The chief justice is said to have stated that the only person he
trusts was His Majesty the King.’

The newspaper did not say so but it is assumed that Ramodibedi
thinks King Mswati will cancel the arrest warrant.

It is true that King Mswati personally appointed and
re-appointed Ramodibedi to the post of Chief Justice and that Ramodibedi has
been a loyal and vocal supporter of the King. But, it is not so clear that Ramodibedi
still enjoys the King’s favour. The King rules over the judiciary and the Swazi
Government which he hand-picks and it is inconceivable that the arrest warrant
would have been issued without his permission.

One speculation is that the Chief Justice will be
allowed to leave his house at the dead of night and escape into neighbouring
South Africa.

Many observers find it hard to imagine that Ramodibedi,
a personal appointee of the King, will be allowed to be tried in a court of law.
The main charges against him are of abuse of power, but international observers
will note that the (for now) alleged abuses were made on behalf of and for the
benefit of the King.

If the spotlight is allowed to shine on Ramodibedi,
it will shine also on the King.

Police in
Swaziland said they would arrest anyone at this week’s May Day celebrations who
‘utter defamatory statements about authorities’.

But, they
said they would to allow people to mark the day on 1 May.

The Swazi Observer, a newspaper in effect owned by King
Mswati III, who rules Swaziland as an absolute monarch, reported on Tuesday (28
April 2015) , ‘Police Information and Communications Officer Assistant
Superintendent Khulani Mamba said since this was an internationally recognised
day, they would not hinder the celebrations by workers but would deal with
those that would utter statements against authority.’

He added,
‘However, those that will utter defamatory statements about authorities will be
arrested.’

This warning
was aimed at people who advocate for democracy in Swaziland where no political
parties are allowed to contest elections and opposition groups are banned as
‘terrorists’ under the controversial Suppression of Terrorism Act 2008.

At the
May Day celebrations in 2014, People’s United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO)
President Mario Masuku and the party’s youth congress leader Maxwell Dlamini
were arrested and charged with uttering seditious statements. They have been in
jail for a year awaiting trial.

The Swaziland Tourist Authority (STA) falsified
statistics on the number of passengers using the new King Msawati III Airport (KMIII)
to make it look a success when it was not.

And, the deception is part of an ongoing mission of
misinformation about the success of the airport that has spanned several year.

Figures for January 2015 were used by Swaziland
Civil Aviation Authority (SWACAA), aided by the Swazi Observer, a newspaper in effect owned by King Mswati, to
state that the airport had defied its critics and was a success.

The STA reported that there were 10,138 passengers
departing the airport in January 2015 and 6,592 passengers arriving, making a
total of 16,730 passengers.

But these figures were entirely bogus. There are
only three flights per day departing the airport and another three arriving.
The airport serves only one route – to OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg, South
Africa. Swaziland Airlink is the only passenger airline that uses the airport.
Airlink uses the Embraer J135 aircraft which has a maximum seating capacity of
50.

If every flight was full a maximum of 150 people per
day could depart the airport, which would make a maximum of 4,500 per month.
The 4,500 is only 44 per cent of the numbers of passengers claimed by STA. The
total possible number of passengers either departing or arriving at the airport
could not be more than 9,000 in a month: 53 per cent of the figure claimed.

No true figure for the actual number of people
travelling by plane is available publically but anecdotal evidence suggests
that the planes are rarely much more than two-thirds full, and often a lot
less.

King Mswati III Airport was built in a wilderness in
Swaziland on the whim of King Mswati, who rules as sub-Saharan Africa’s last
absolute monarch. No research was undertaken to determine the need for the
airport.

Critics of the airport argued for years that there
was no
potential for the airport. Major airports already existed less than an
hour’s flying time away in South Africa with connecting routes to Swaziland and
there was no reason to suspect passengers would want to use KMIII airport as an
alternative.

During the 11 years it took to build, the airport
was called Sikhuphe, but the name was changed in honour of the King when it
officially opened in March 2014.

The airport cost an estimated E2.5 billion (US$250
million) to build.

The Observer
on Saturdayreported
at the time of the opening, ‘The King stated unflinchingly that the airport
was not a joke as some pessimists had already hinted that the country does not
need such extravagance. He said the completion and commissioning of the airport
had proved all doubting Thomases wrong.’

The newspaper added, ‘One thing was clear throughout
the King’s address that he was extremely passionate about the project and that
it was very close to his heart.’

When it was opened the international
media derided the airport as a ‘white elephant’, meaning it was of little
use.

Since it opened only one commercial passenger airline,
Swaziland Airlink, which is part-owned by the Swazi Government, has used the
Airport. The airline was forced
to move from the Matsapha Airport, even though an independent
business analysis predicted the airline would go out of business as a
result.

No other airline has publically said it wanted to
use the airport.

Matsapha airport which handled about 70,000
passengers a year is close to Manzini and Mbabane, the two main cities in
Swaziland. The new airport was built in a wilderness about 70km from Mbabane.
Once it opened to traffic in September 2014, Matsapha was closed for commercial
business. It is now mainly used by King Mswati when he travels in his private
luxury jet.

SWACAA
had said the KMIII airport would attract 300,000 passengers per year (820
per day on average), raising E7 million (US$700,000) per year in service
charges. In the present situation where only a maximum 300 people could travel
per day, the total it could ever hope to achieve would be 109,500; only 36
percent of the numbers needed for the airport to reach its target.

The Swazi Observer,
which was described as a
‘pure propaganda machine for the royal family’ by the Media Institute of
Southern Africa in a report on media freedom in the kingdom, used the bogus
figure to talk up the airport’s supposed success.

The newspaper was determined to mislead its readers
about the success of the airport. The Sunday Observer, for example, in a
report headlined ‘KMIII Airport surpasses expectations’ said, ‘When it started
operating, sceptics were of the view that people would opt to travel by road
because of, among other reasons, the distant location of the airport, which is
situated about 70 kilometres from Mbabane.

‘However, passengers going through KMIII
International Airport have surpassed the numbers that were recorded at the
Matsapha Airport.’

The newspaper quoted SWACAA Marketing and Corporate
Affairs Director Sabelo Dlamini saying, ‘We are noting that the figures are
rising and for us, it points to a brighter future in aviation. It is also an
affirmation of the massive work the government of Swaziland has done over the
past five years to do right in the civil aviation industry, in particular the
construction of an airport facility travellers are happy with.’

The newspaper reported, ‘Dlamini further noted that
the drop in numbers that had been projected by critics had not happened at
all.’

There has been a long history of misinformation
about the potential for success of the airport. It was controversial from the
moment the construction was announced in 2003. The International Monetary
Fund said the airport should not be built because it would divert funds
away from much needed projects to fight poverty in Swaziland.

Today, about seven in ten of King Mswati’s 1.3
million subjects live in abject poverty, with incomes less than US$2 per day, three
in ten are so hungry they are medically diagnosed as malnourished and the
kingdom has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world.

The false promises made about the airport are
legion. In November
2013, SWACAA said that the Swazi Government was ready to recreate the
defunct Royal Swazi National Airways Corporation (RSNAC0) and would set about
purchasing a 100-seater jet, at a cost estimated by the Times of Swaziland of
E700 million (US$70 million). This compared to the E125 million budgeted
for free primary school education in Swaziland that year. It was never
explained where the money to buy the aircraft would come from.

SWACAA said RSNAC would fly to 10 destinations in
Africa and Asia. Observers estimated RSNAC would probably need a minimum of 10
aircraft to service the routes. For that to happen, Swaziland would have to
spend about E7 billion on aircraft. Such a sum of money would bankrupt the
kingdom. To put the cost in context the Central Bank of Swaziland has estimated
the kingdom’s gross
official reserves were E8.24 billion at the month ended November 2013.

The people were regularly misled about the opening
date of the airport. At one time the King confidently
announced it would be open in March 2010. Then his Prime Minister Barnabas
Dlamini said it would be ready for the FIFA World Cup in neighbouring South
Africa in June 2010, but this deadline came and went. SWACAA continued to issue
fresh completion dates but these were never met.

Bertram Stewart, Principal Secretary in the Ministry
of Economic Planning and Development also misled about the readiness of the
airport to open.

In October 2010, Stewart
said the airport would be open by the end of that year, but it was not. He
misled again in
February 2011 when he confidently told media the airport would be completed
by June 2011. It was not. He also said a number of top world airlines (that he
declined to name) were negotiating to use the airport, but nothing happened.

There has also been constant misinformation about
the prospect of airlines choosing to use the airport.

In October 2009, King Mswati claimed Etihad Airways
from the Gulf
State of Abu Dhabi was showing ‘deep interest’ in using the airport.
Nothing has been heard since.

In May 2011, the Swazi Observer reported Sabelo Dlamini
saying, ‘We have established possible routes which we want to market to the
operators. Some of the proposed routes from Sikhuphe are Durban, Cape Town,
Lanseria Airport in Sandton, Harare and Mozambique.’

In June 2012, he told
Swazi media that at least three airlines from different countries had
‘shown interest’ in using the airport, but he declined to name them. He remained
optimistic about the prospects for the future and said SWACAA was talking
to airlines in other countries as well.

Then in February 2013 SWACAA Director Solomon Dube told
media in Swaziland, ‘We are talking to some including Kenya Airways,
Ethiopian Airline and various Gulf airlines.’

In March 2013 SWACAA
claimed five airlines had signed deals to use the airport when it
eventually opened, but an investigation by Swazi media Commentary revealed that
two of the airlines named did not exist. It also said Botswana Airways would
use the airport, but it has not.

In October 2013 SWACAA claimed it had targeted
small and medium business travellers to use the airport. It said low-cost
airlines were interested in using Sikhuphe for business travellers who might
want to fly to nearby countries ‘on a daily basis’.

Now, in April 2015, there are still no prospects of
airlines other than Swazi Airlink using the airport.

Trade unionists and democracy campaigners in
Swaziland are on a collision course with the police and state security after
they refused to seek formal permission to hold a May Day rally.

The Trade Union Congress of Swaziland (TUCOSWA) has
confirmed that commemorations of the workers’ day will take place at the Salesian
Sports Ground in Manzini, the commercial capital of Swaziland, on 1 May 2015.

Vincent Ncongwane, TUCOSWA Secretary General, said
his federation had informed the police of its decision to host the event.

The Times of Swaziland, the only independent daily newspaper
in the kingdom ruled by King Mswati III, the last absolute monarch in
sub-Saharan Africa, reported him saying, ‘We will not be seeking permission
from the police to host the event, it is unlawful to be forced to seek
permission and there is no statute in the labour laws that allows the police to
demand us to seek permission from them to host Workers Day.’

He added the fact that they had informed the police
was sufficient and that they would not be seeking permission as police had
instructed them to do in past years.

The decision not to seek permission will almost
certainly put TUCOSWA on a collision course with the police and the state
security apparatus.

Public gatherings are routinely disrupted by police
unless they are sanctioned by the state. On Thursday (23 April 2015), for
example, a newly-formed group called Swaziland Anti-Xenophobia Movement had a gathering
broken up by police because they did not have permission from the Municipal
Council of Mbabane to meet.

They were trying to show their support for victims
of Xenophobic attacks in neighbouring South Africa and tried to march to the
South African High Commission in the Swazi capital, Mbabane.

At May Day celebrations last year (2014), Mario
Masuku, President of the People’s United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), and
Maxwell Dlamini, Secretary-General of the Swaziland Youth Congress (SWAYOCO),
were charged with ‘uttering seditious statements’. One year later they are
still in prison awaiting trial.

The two were arrested following a pro-democracy rally at the Salesian
Sports Ground, the proposed venue for this year’s rally.

PUDEMO has been banned in Swaziland as a ‘terrorist’ organisation since
2008, under the controversial Suppression of Terrorism Act.

In May 2013, Muzi Mhlanga, the secretary general of
the Swaziland National Association of Teachers (SNAT), was illegally placed
under house arrest by police who wanted to prevent him attending a May Day
rally. They had neither a court order nor warrant to place him under house
arrest.

Arrests
were reported across the kingdom as democracy leaders refused police
instructions to say at home and not attend May Day events.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Meteorologist Jim Cantore Defends Himself From Attack on Live TV with a Swift Knee to the Nuts [VIDEO]

Seems like Jim Cantore would be one of the last people you would want to try and tackle. He’s fought hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes, and on live TV a guy decided to try and tackle him and ruin a live report… NEVER under estimate a good knee to the crotch!

Seriously, Cantore is like a Weather Channel Ninja. He’s reported in Floods, Wild Fires, Hurricanes, Tornadoes and more. Sometimes he appears to be fearless (or maybe crazy). Jim was doing a live piece from Charleston College to cover the winter weather, when a guy, thought to be a student, comes running at him screaming, Jim keeps talking, sees the guy, then knees the guy in the junk, and keeps on talking like it’s no big deal.

"Cheater Payback-Chapter Seven

Cathy told Bill to get her another towel, there was no need to say why because the old one was getting pretty soggy, to say the least. She folded it once and then got back into position. With open legs she reached over and grabbed hold of Rick’s pecker and pulled him with it, placing it at her cunt’s entrance. When Bill plunged into the very wet, well-lubricated, private place, her vaginal walls fluttered around it as he slid in, balls deep. It felt wonderful, and he could feel Cathy’s flesh spread while at the same time she was squeezing him with it. Cathy gave out a little laugh and asked, “Do you like that?” He answered her with a slap, slap, slap, slap noise of a dick and a wet pussy banging together. After a good long minute or so he was still going at her with his body. Cathy said “Rick, honey, take it easy, you aren’t going to wear my pussy out, you are just wearing yourself out. But, oh God your cock feels so good in there.” Bill was watching everything and did exactly what Cathy was hoping he would do, that being taking one of her legs and holding it up, pointing towards the ceiling. This allowed Rick better access and provided Bill a better scene for his perverted eyes. Cathy opened her legs wider and did what she had just been taught, that being pulling Rick into him hard and allowing his cock more penetration to squirt her deep inside her eggbox. She was also going to do this with her husband next chance he got. Anyway, Cathy was squirming and bouncing around, her tits jammed into his chest and her nails digging into his back like some sort of wildcat in heat. She was also cussing worse than a sailor with a lot of F, C, S, and P words. The nasty woman was an exciting and talented fuck. She had years of experience screwing and making babies in the marriage bed. As well as a few other places. She was nearing climax so she told Rick, “Don’t stop fucking me you S.O.B., faster, faster, fuck me hard, honey!” Slamming her naked body at him violently working on her orgasm. Bill was also helping her by pulling on her leg to meet their crotch slamming lewdness. Poor Rick was just along for the ride as he tried to keep his cum inside his balls for her. Cathy became limp as her body shivered and shuttered in pleasure as her jets inside released a load of girl cum soaking Rick’s already wet dick. With a smile of a satisfied woman on Cathy’s beautiful face she gave Rick a sexy kiss on the lips, and like a high school kid also gave him a hickey on his neck as her whole body continued to rock with sexual satisfaction. She said weakly, Go ahead Rick shoot your load in me now.” Rick went stiff as he shot off, he felt his cock going fwt fwt fwt fwt fwt, as five bolts of sperm went into her. He lied atop her as the two sweaty bodies hugged each other, exhausted and spent. Bill slowly eased Cathy’s leg down onto Rick and she rested it on his bottom. Bill had to wait patiently for Cathy to regurgitate so he could fuck her again. End of chapter seven.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

N2 - Constraint logic programming has been shown to be a very useful tool for knowledge representation and problem-solving in different areas. Finite Domain extensions of PROLOG together with efficient consistency techniques such as forward-checking and looking-ahead make it possible to solve many discrete combinatorial problems within a short development time. In this paper we present the weak looking-ahead strategy (WLA), a new consistency technique on finite domains combining the computational efficiency of forward-checking with the pruning power of looking-ahead. Moreover, incorporating weak looking-ahead into PROLOG's SLD resolution gives a sound and complete inference rule whereas standard looking-ahead itself has been shown to be incomplete. Finally, we will show how to use weak looking-ahead in a real-world application to obtain an early search-space pruning while avoiding the control overhead involved by standard looking-ahead.

Men with high mate quality (e.g. handsome, rich, etc.) tend to do less parental investment (because they have greater mating opportunity costs). Their mates put up with it, as it were, because of the trade-off for high mate quality. These men tend to have greater facial symmetry and testosterone, and women are more likely to have sex with them. The men themselves, might provide positive feedback here as well (e.g. greater testosterone leads to greater sex drive).

Its based on principles for Parentla Investment and Sexual Selection theory.

Seems like they could easily be confusing cause and correlation. Seems entirely possible to me that men that are more prone to do ""womens's chores"" could easily be men with lesser sexual drives--or they simply have less direct and forward mentalities so they're less likely to initiate...activities...to begin with.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The collective hysteria over fake news, Russia’s alleged role in the DNC hack, and the unsubstantiated kompramat that supposedly links Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin has reached a fever pitch. But mainstream cable news and the Washington intelligentsia have somehow neglected to connect it to a crucial piece of the US history: its long-standing tradition, euphemistically known as the Truman Doctrine, of intervening in democratic elections abroad to promote its commercial and ideological interests.

Truman’s doctrine would “support free peoples,” he proclaimed in March 1947, “who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.” Indeed, he and his successors would go to great lengths to keep this promise during the Cold War. American presidents repeatedly directed the CIA to overthrow freely elected leaders in Iran, Guatemala, the Congo, and Chile because they nationalized industries, threatened corporate interests, and obstructed the United States’ imperial ambitions. American officials falsely branded these leaders as Communists, framed them as threats to national security, and authorized covert operations to replace them with dictators who would serve US interests.

Omission of this history from today’s discourse on Russia and our adversaries prevents our leaders, and especially the American public, from realizing the same tools the United States used to interfere in others’ affairs are now being used against us.

Shielded by this ignorance, it is easy for US officials to portray us as the victims of attacks rather than the inventors of the weapons. When Senator John McCain, for example, says, “If you’re able to change the results of an election, then you have undermined the very fundamentals of democracy,” he forgets to mention this is precisely what the United States did in Iran, Guatemala, the Congo, and Chile when they were just beginning to experience democracy.

In 1953, a US-backed military coup overthrew Iran’s first democratically elected leader, Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, in response to his decision to nationalize the highly lucrative oil industry, cutting off the gravy train the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had been riding since 1909.

Time had honored the Western-educated leader the year before the coup as its man of the year, hailing him as “the most world-renowned man his ancient race had produced for centuries.” Suddenly, because he wanted to use Iran’s oil wealth to benefit his country, he was deemed a pinko.

Using American tax dollars to develop a network of Iranian agents and to bribe the regime’s opponents, the CIA launched political warfare against Mossadegh. It distributed fake news via posters and newspapers that called him corrupt, anti-Islam, and the Soviet Union’s ally, it encouraged religious leaders to criticize the prime minister from inside their mosques, and it enlisted street mobs to incite riots across Tehran.

Success finally came on August 19. Paid infiltrators played both sides: some posed as Tudeh party members attempting to foment revolution while others convinced the citizens to rise up against this threat. Eventually, amid growing anarchy, General Fazlollah Zahedi, paid off by the CIA, ordered his bribed military units to seize government facilities and Radio Tehran. He proclaimed himself “the lawful prime minister by the Shah’s orders” and collected $1 million in cash from the CIA.

Soon after, the Shah — Washington’s chosen dictator — assumed the throne, American oil companies moved in, and US-Iranian relations quickly warmed as the new regime squashed dissent, imprisoned opponents, and received unprecedented US arms shipments, American assistance to create the Monarchy’s secret police, and US support to develop Iran’s civilian nuclear program.

The American recipe for overthrow continued to evolve. Guatemala’s freely elected president Jacobo Arbenz became the next target when his New Deal-style programs threatened the interests of American corporations. The powerful United Fruit Company, whose executives were in bed with a number of influential American officials — some of whom were former employees and some of whom had financial interests in the corporation — found Arbenz’s policies especially worrying.

The Agrarian Reform Law of 1952 authorized the Guatemalan government to seize vast tracts of United Fruit’s uncultivated acres. The next December, the CIA’s Operation SUCCESS set in motion a six-month coup. CIA agents used Voice of Liberation radio to broadcast fake news describing an impending communist takeover and civilian uprisings, recruited a rebel army to sow unrest, distributed religious leaflets calling Catholics to revolt, and coordinated air raids that dropped bombs on military installations and other targets across Guatemala City.

These efforts turned popular and military support against Arbenz, forcing his resignation and paving the way for Castillo Armas — the United States’ handpicked dictator — to become president. This established a long line of dictators, death squads, oppression, and near-genocide that wreaked havoc across Guatemala for the next four decades.

In 1960, American meddling escalated. President Eisenhower decided to skip the coup and go straight to assassination. He ordered — once again using the false pretense of an impending communist threat — the CIA to assassinate Congo’s democratically elected prime minister Patrice Lumumba, the young nationalist who ended seven decades of brutal Belgian rule and promised Congolese citizens a better future with greater control over the country’s natural resources.

When the plot to poison Lumumba failed, the CIA outsourced the job to Congolese accomplices and Belgian officers. With the help of Joseph Mobutu, the repressive military dictator installed by the United States who would rule for three decades, they eventually captured him and handed him over to his enemies. They tortured Lumumba, then murdered him by firing squad on January 17, 1961 — just three days before John F. Kennedy was inaugurated as the freely elected president of the United States.

During the early 1970s, commercial interests once again required CIA assistance. When Chile elected Salvador Allende, the anti-imperialist, working-class champion, he nationalized profitable American-dominated industries such as communications and copper, the resource gem for which Chile was the world’s leading supplier.

President Nixon, who believed the false reports of Soviet influence he received from American and Chilean industrial titans, authorized the CIA to overthrow Allende, setting in motion a ferocious propaganda campaign that included distributing fake news, strangling economic development, conspiring with disgruntled Chilean officers, indirectly assassinating a senior military leader, and staging anti-government protests.

On the climactic day of the coup, September 11, 1973, Allende gave his last words over the radio while barricaded inside the presidential palace. He indicted foreign capital and imperialism as the causes that “created the climate for the Army to break with their tradition” by carrying out American covert action. Moments before he died, he proclaimed, “Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers!”

It is slightly ironic, given the country’s record of international meddling, that American officials are whining about the “tradition in Russia of interfering in elections,” as Director of National Intelligence James Clapper recently said. Or to hear McCain say Russia’s actions are “the sign of a possible unraveling of the world order that was established after World War II… one of the most peaceful periods in the history of the world” — the same period when the United States intervened in Iran, Guatemala, the Congo, and Chile. Or to hear Representative Elijah Cummings say, “Russia’s attacks on our election are an attempt to degrade our democracy and should chill every American.”

Our electoral integrity is a legitimate concern, and American officials should express outrage at Russia’s alleged actions (should they turn out to be true). But every American should feel equally chilled by our history of undemocratic electoral interference around the world. Millions of Iranians, Guatemalans, Congolese, and Chileans suffered under the iron grips of unelected dictators the United States installed.

Hundreds of thousands died in the aftermath of these coups, countries split into civil wars, untold natural riches were stolen, and countless others endured unspeakable trauma and loss. Unforeseen blowback in response to these actions will likely continue in the years ahead.

Whether it was Russian spies or American couch potatoes who convinced Podesta to give up his password, the United States has not suffered the way other countries have — at least not yet. As the tools of American power proliferate and fall into the hands of our supposed adversaries — arms, nuclear weapons, coups, drones, and cyber-warfare — we must confront the reality that as long as the United States continues its habit of meddling abroad, other countries will be tempted to use these and other forms of covert action against us.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

FILE PHOTO. President Donald Trump's tweets calling for a probe of widespread voter fraud but providing no evidence that it actually took place have rankled California elections officials.
Pool/Getty Images

In the wake of President Donald Trump's call Wednesday for an investigation into widespread voter fraud, a claim widely seen as without merit, California's Secretary of State Alex Padilla pushed back sharply, calling the contention ""a flat-out lie.""

Trump repeated his previous criticism of the voting process on Twitter saying he may move to strengthen voting procedures depending on the investigation's results.

I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and....

Padilla said officials have been hearing for several months about Trump's allegations of rampant voter fraud across the country, especially in California, which voted overwhelmingly for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.

""But despite our request for any information he may have, they have yet to provide any evidence, any proof to back up their claims,"" Padilla said. ""It's frankly dangerous to people's faith in our democratic system.""

Trump's insistence that there was massive voter fraud has confounded political observers who say he may be undermining his own election and that of other Republicans on 2016 voter ballots.

Trump's yet unsubstantiated claim was also dismissed by Democrats and some Republicans.

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said Tuesday that he has “seen no evidence to that effect.” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said at a news conference Wednesday that she cannot understand why the newly installed president is “so insecure.”

“To suggest and to undermine the integrity of our voter system is really strange,” Pelosi said. “... On top of it, he wants to investigate something that can clearly be proven to be false, but he resists investigations of a Russian disruption of our election and any connection to his campaign. All we want is the truth for the American people.”

On Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer fielded questions during a press briefing about President Trump's views on voter fraud. Spicer did not provide specifics on what evidence the president based his statements on.

""I think he stated his concerns of voter fraud and people voting illegally during the campaign and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him,"" Spicer said.

Los Angeles County Registrar Dean Logan said he is concerned about the impression that Trump's tweets are sending to voters.

""What I think is important is that we don't send a message to our electorate that their vote is in question or that their vote doesn't have value,"" he said.

Logan acknowledged that in Los Angeles County duplicate registrations do occur, usually when voters move addresses. Logan also said sometimes people who have died are still on the voter rolls after their death. But he said there's no evidence that those situations have led to incorrect votes.

""The voter registration list is a fluid list,"" he said. ""There is going to be a timing issue.""

Logan said voters should be confident in the system.

""I believe that there are safeguards in place to ensure the integrity of the election,"" Logan said.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

SELECT HowTo FROM WriteSQLSyntax Part 1 : DML

In my years working in BPM, SQL syntax has played a part in almost every peice of work. The ‘long running’ characteristic of BPM requires that process and state data be persisted to a long term data store because this will ultimatley outlast the hosting server in terms of lenth of operation (some processes could go on for years). As well as using databases for peristing BPM state, almost every application that exists these days, including applications or systems that utilise BPM have a data store of some kind that will need to be queried for user or process data. It’s a given that you know SQL in this day and age.

For the experienced developer, this article is not for you.

SQL is a standard that allows for the general interaction with database data. We have the commands that manipulation existing data and the commands that build the structure of the data (tables, schemas etc). Microsoft have a flavour of standard SQL-92 that they name Transact-SQL and split this language into 2 main categories. DML (data manipulation language) are the statements used to manipulate your data using common statements such as SELECT and UPDATE. DDL (Data Definition Language) represents the TSQL statements that assist the management and maintenance of your database objects (ALTER PROCEDURE, DROP TABLE etc).

SQL skills are seen as a basic essential requirement these days in the fields of software development, BPM, EAI, web site design and even scripting and so having a this under your belt is a must. I’ve tried to create a ‘cheat sheet’ of sorts for the DML side of the TSQL language which can be used as a quick reference, starting with the basics :

Dog and family dealing with personal issues

Dog the Bounty Hunter is back for 2012! Find out what sort of shenanigans brought in millions of viewers during its Wednesday night debut.

Duane ""Dog"" Chapman and his family of bounty hunters snagged nearly 2.9 million viewers for the first episode of Dog the Bounty Hunter for the new season, according to the network.

""The eighth season premiere was cable's most-watched entertainment show in the 10 p.m. hour last night and A&E became the number one entertainment cable network in primetime among adults 25-54 and 18-49 for the night,"" the network said in a statement.

This season is poised to explore some family problems within the large Chapman family — daughter ""Baby"" Lyssa Chapman's March arrest will air on an episode, as will tensions between Chapman and his oldest son, Duane Lee.

""I love you, dad. This is Travis. I want to go home. I don't like it here,"" the boy told his father also named Travis. They gained custody after an audio recording surfaced that allegedly showed the father beating the child with a belt.

""I've told (my grandson) that daddy is not gone forever. Daddy has to go to school and you know what he told me, 'will they really tell him not to hit me anymore?' I said yes they won't just tell him they'll make sure, and he goes (big sigh) 'good,'"" Dog said.

It sounds like they'll be dealing more with family drama than criminal drama this season.

Goldcorp says protest could halt production at Mexico gold mine

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Canada’s Goldcorp said on Monday an ongoing protest blocking entry to its Penasquito mine, one of Mexico’s biggest gold producers, could force the company to halt output.

The mine, in northern Zacatecas state, produced 476,000 ounces of gold last year, comprising 18 percent of Goldcorp’s total production and generating more than 33 percent of its revenue.

The demonstration began on June 1, led by local truck-drivers who say the company reneged on promises to hire locally.

Local residents also blocked access at the mine last year, protesting for more than a week over a water dispute. The company later said it was able to resume normal operations without a hit to production.

Michael Harvey, Goldcorp’s director of corporate affairs, said the current blockade was illegal and had prevented the flow of workers and supplies.

“We are still working, but if we can’t let supplies in, at some point we will stop producing,” he said.

Ascension Carrillo, one of the protest leaders, said the goal was to get Goldcorp to fulfill its hiring promises.

“The only thing we want is the work that was promised to us ... we’re fighting to feed our families,” Carrillo said.

"Same-sex marriage legalized in Australia by overwhelmingly public vote

Australians at home and abroad are rejoicing because their fellow countrymen & women have made sure their voices are heard regarding same-sex marriage — and they are all unanimously in favor of it!

According to the results of a groundbreaking national postal survey that was carried out by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), close to 62 percent of Australians who voted said YES to legalize same-sex marriage with a clear majority in every single state and territory demanding they get marriage equality. The overall turnout of eligible voters nationwide was close to 76 percent.

The government, which chose to survey the people instead of conventional methods, will present the results before the parliament to pass the verdict on the issue.

Its expected that a bill for the same will pass, with many opponents of same-sex marriage in their parliament surprisingly promising to respect the result and provisions for amendments. Labor MPs are unanimously in favor of the bill along with a large section of cross-benchers expected to support the bill.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (who voted yes), has already pledged to follow through with the popular vote. “We must respect the voice of our people. We asked them for their opinion and they have clearly given it to us. It is overwhelming,” he said at a press conference. The Prime Minister said a decision vote will come sometime before Christmas.

The Opposition Labor Party’s leader, Bill Shorten, at a rally in Melbourne, said: “What a fabulous time to be an Australian – because in this survey the Australian population has stated that Australia is absolutely ready for wholesome marriage equality.

With this, Australia is en route to become the 25th country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage (in at least some jurisdictions and provinces).",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Liestal, Switzerland, September 28, 2016 - Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) announces that the first patient has been enrolled at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC), Department of Neurology, Kansas (USA) in Santhera's randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III (SIDEROS) trial. The trial will assess the efficacy of Raxone in slowing the rate of respiratory function decline in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoids.

""We first observed the efficacy of Raxone in slowing the rate of respiratory function decline in DMD patients in both glucocorticoid-using and non-using patients in the phase II DELPHI study,"" commented
Thomas Meier
, PhD, CEO of Santhera. ""The successful Phase III DELOS trial which enrolled glucocorticoid non-using patients then confirmed a clinically relevant and statistically significant benefit of Raxone treatment on pulmonary function. The now initiated Phase III SIDEROS trial is designed to confirm the efficacy of Raxone in patients experiencing respiratory function decline that are currently taking glucocorticoids. If successful, this study will provide data that support use of Raxone in all DMD patients experiencing respiratory decline irrespective of their glucocorticoid use. The high level of interest from investigators and the patient community should allow us to recruit this study quickly.""

""We are hopeful that this phase III trial is the final step in the development program with Raxone in DMD,"" said
Gunnar Buyse
, MD, PhD, Professor of Child Neurology at the University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium) and SIDEROS PI and Lead Investigator for Europe. ""Following the exploratory phase II program and the successful phase III DELOS trial, I am grateful that Santhera is committed in exploring the full therapeutic potential of Raxone for patients with DMD.""

""Maintaining pulmonary function in patients with DMD has only recently become a prominent therapeutic objective in DMD, particularly in non-ambulatory patients,"" added
Oscar Henry Mayer
, MD, Medical Director of the Pulmonary Function Testing Laboratory at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and Lead Investigator for US. ""A patient and caregiver survey conducted by Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy clearly demonstrated that the DMD community highly values treatment options for pulmonary complications.""

About the SIDEROS Trial
SIDEROS is a phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with Raxone in approximately 260 DMD patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoids. Patients with declining respiratory function on any stable glucocorticoid treatment scheme and irrespective of the underlying dystrophin mutation or ambulatory status will be eligible. Study participants will receive either Raxone (900 mg/day; given as 2 tablets 3 times a day with meals) or placebo for 78 weeks (18 months). The primary endpoint of the trial is change from baseline to week 78 in forced vital capacity % predicted (FVC%p). Secondary endpoints include changes from baseline in % predicted peak expiratory flow (PEF%p), time to first 10% decline in FVC and change from baseline in inspiratory flow reserve. Patients completing the trial will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an open label extension study where all patients receive Raxone. The study will be conducted at about 50 centers in the United States and Europe. Patients wishing to enroll in the study should contact their neuromuscular clinic physician. Further information about the study is available under
www.clinicaltrials.gov
.

About Raxone
®
(Idebenone) in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Regulatory Status
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most common and devastating types of muscle degeneration and results in rapidly progressive muscle weakness. DMD is characterized by a loss of the protein dystrophin, leading to cell damage, impaired calcium homeostasis, elevated oxidative stress and reduced energy production in muscle cells. This results in progressive muscle weakness and wasting and early morbidity and mortality due to respiratory failure.

Idebenone is a synthetic short-chain benzoquinone and a cofactor for the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) capable of stimulating mitochondrial electron transport, reducing and scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) and supplementing cellular energy levels.

The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is currently assessing a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Raxone in DMD patients with respiratory function decline who are not taking concomitant glucocorticoids. The indication would include patients who previously were treated with glucocorticoids or in whom glucocorticoid treatment is not desired, not tolerated or is contraindicated. The MAA was submitted as a Type II variation of the company's existing marketing authorization for Raxone for the treatment of visual impairment in patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).

About Santhera
Santhera Pharmaceuticals (SIX: SANN) is a Swiss specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative pharmaceutical products for the treatment of orphan mitochondrial and neuromuscular diseases. Santhera's lead product Raxone is authorized in the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein for the treatment of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). For Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the second indication for Raxone, Santhera has filed a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the European Union. In collaboration with the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Santhera is developing Raxone in a third indication, primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), and omigapil for congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD), all areas of high unmet medical need.

"The new documentary Beyond Elections: Redefining Democracy in the Americas proves that democracy can and should be more than casting a ballot every four years. This empowering film gives hopeful and concrete examples from around the Americas of people taking back the reigns of power and governing their own communities. Beyond Elections is a road map for social change, drawing from communal councils in Venezuela and social movements in Bolivia to participatory budgeting in Brazil and worker cooperatives in Argentina. The film gracefully succeeds in demonstrating that these grassroots examples of people’s power can be applied anywhere. Particularly as activists in the US face the challenges of an Obama administration and an economic crisis, this timely documentary shows that the revolution can start today right in your own living room or neighborhood.

In this interview, Michael Fox, Co-Producer of Beyond Elections, talks about how the film was created, what its aims were, and what impact the film has had among viewers in the US.

Benjamin Dangl: How did you decide on the focus and message of Beyond Elections?

Michael Fox: I’ve been living and working in Latin America for many years, studying and reporting on, above all else, the experiences in participatory democracy — cooperatives, communal councils, participatory budgeting, social movements, community radio, etc. . . . Sílvia (my wife, who grew up in Southern Brazil, and who is also Co-director of the film) and I were living in Venezuela in 2006 when the communal councils law was passed, and local communities all across the country began to come together and take on this new form of organizing. You could see how it was empowering people on an individual and local level.

In March of 2007, Sílvia and I found ourselves in Porto Alegre, Brazil — where we now live — at the same time that the 2007 Participatory Budgeting cycle was about to begin. We realized that although there have been many local videos on the experiences of participatory budgeting, cooperatives, social movements and even some on the recently-formed communal councils, there was no documentary film that tried to give both the big and local picture of these new participatory concepts of democracy across the hemisphere.

This concept is almost completely absent in the United States, and yet, it is absolutely necessarily for people to understand what is going on across Latin America, and also extremely important for activists and people in the United States to understand the failures of our own system and the lack of participation and input from everyday citizens.

We originally planned the film to focus only on participatory democracy, but quickly realized that the only people who would want to see it would be activists that are already doing this type of work. We needed to open it up to the very concept of democracy itself.

This was important to us, because time and again in the United States, pundits, elected officials, everyday folks, and even journalists use the word “democracy” as an excuse to de-legitimize extremely democratic groups and governments. They say, “Venezuela is threatening democracy in the region,” and yet depending on your definition, Venezuela is perhaps the most democratic country in the region — much more so than the United States. But these realities are very subtle, and if you have never been to Venezuela, or Brazil, or Bolivia, or Ecuador (or if you go and only stay at the resorts and the upper-class part of town), then you’re never going to know what to believe because the mainstream media is quick to repeat the manipulations.

There are some mainstream media that actually call Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez a dictator, despite the fact that during his ten years in office there have been more than a dozen free and fair elections in Venezuela legitimately recognized by international observers from around the world, and that he has always respected the Venezuelan Constitution and the laws. He may be a very charismatic, domineering, and powerful figure, but he’s not a dictator.

Then the real question is, “What is democracy?” And that’s where we wanted to focus our attention — giving people the space to tell their stories across the Hemisphere.

As the Portuguese Sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos says, (and you can find the link to more of his work on our website, www.beyondelections.com), the United States has created a monopoly on the definition of democracy — U.S. style hegemonic representative politics.

But Sousa Santos points out that, in reality, democracy is a work in progress. As he says, “democracy without end.”

His colleague, Leonardo Avritzer, professor from Brazilian Federal University of Minas Gerais, points out in our film, “What we’ve tried to stress is the idea that democracy is an open concept and the frontiers of democracy are always imprecise. For instance, in the 19th century you could say that it’s democratic to expand suffrage. And that’s true. It was democratic at the end of the 19th century to expand suffrage to women. Or at the beginning of the 20th century it could appear democratic to expand democracy to the countries of the global South. So the question today in the Southern countries is how to think about the democratization of things like the budget, health policies, education policies, urban policies, the democratization of life where you live.”

Of course, it’s not always easy. Especially when you are trying to make a film for not one audience, but audiences in various languages all across the Hemisphere. But that’s what we set out to do, and I think we succeeded.

BD: Could you talk a bit about the process of making your documentary?

MF: This is very important, because we wanted the making of the film to reflect as much as possible the “democracy” that we are trying to portray. We used very little narration — only about two and a half minutes worth — because we wanted people to tell the stories in their own words. We tried not to change the scenery where we were filming. We only used music from local musicians, and tried to only use it when it was part of the scene. It is also a testament to what two people can do without any external resources or really expensive equipment.

The entire budget came out of our own pockets and Silvia and I filmed nearly the entire film with our Panasonic 3CCD handycam, and edited it all on our aging G4 Powerbook.

Of course, we had more than a half a dozen individuals and groups that supported with b-roll, and either shot for us, or allowed us to use footage they had already filmed in areas that we couldn’t make it to like Ecuador, Bolivia, and the Bay Area.

The SF-based musician and sound editor, Ben Bernstein, donated his time to post-produce our audio, which came out great. The Venezuela-based film group, Panafilms was a huge support, as were hundreds of folks all across the region.

BD: What was the response among viewers during your tour in the US?

MF: We did our tour last fall from mid September straight through till two days before the 2008 Presidential elections. We drove from the East Coast to the West Coast and back, covering our costs with donations from the nearly two-dozen showings all across the U.S. It was an amazing experience. Of course, we were organizing the tour ourselves, so our audiences varied from a couple hundred people at some Universities all the way down to a living room showing with a few people in Oklahoma City. But really, the response was the best we could have hoped for, and both Silvia and I were impressed with the diversity of opinions. Some viewers were struck by the amount of local democracy and participation in Venezuela specifically, especially with the negative press that it gets in the United States. Many viewers were impressed with the democratic experiences, and the fact that people all across the region are all participating in similar ways. Others were shocked because so little of this is happening in the U.S. Others felt the movie really put things into a perspective that they had rarely seen or heard of before. This was the case of one gentleman in the Lower 9th Ward in New Orleans where we showed Beyond Elections with a projector on the side of a building. He said, “Wow, I’ve always known all of this, but I had never understood that everything was connected. I feel like I have a new perspective on things.”

Without a doubt, the biggest and only major critique was that it was, and remains, a long documentary — just under two hours, which we’ll keep in mind for our next documentary. The DVD version of the movie is divided into chapters, which can each stand alone, so it can easily be used in university and high school classrooms according to theme. The right hand side of the website www.beyondelections.com has dozens of links to additional information, all also sorted according to the chapter and the theme.

We tried to build the film in order to give people an understanding of the realities, and also leave them with a sense of hope. Because these experiences anywhere, be it in Latin America or the United States, in the local government, the community, the office, the school, or the home can only happen if we take the steps to open the democratic spaces of participation. This is the exciting thing about the film and I believe that people could feel it. The film gave people an idea about some of the things that are being done, and some of the things that they can also do. As Sílvia often said in our after-film discussions, “The best thing you can do to support these democratic experiences abroad is to make change in your own communities, attempt to open democracy in your own community.” As a Brazilian, she knows the effect that this can have.

In our discussions after nearly all of our showings, we tried to stress this point: how we can open up these democratic experiences in our own lives. After numerous requests, we actually developed a “Beyond Elections Democracy Discussion Guide,” which attempts to help people to do just that, Bring Democracy Home. It is also available to download halfway down the right-hand side of our website, under “Beyond Elections Materials.”

Monthly Review Essays

Historically, capitalism develops institutions and ideologies that justify surplus extraction and capital accumulation. In the last decades of the twentieth century, the financialization of capitalism initiated a new era of accumulation which is known in academic contexts as finance-capital-driven neoliberalism.

Both Sweezy and Dimitrov agree that fascism arises in the middle class and becomes a threat when the bourgeoisie embraces it, but Sweezy’s unique contribution is to demonstrate fascism’s relationship to the postwar transitional period of class equilibrium.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The contract was for £xx , paid in full when the contract was dated and signed. Jochen said that the contract offer was complicated and I warned him to be very careful as playing for Glasgow Rangers, Scotland's most successfull club, they were likely to win most competitions they entered, meaning that uhlsport may have to pay out a lot in bonus's the way the contract is set out.

When Multicultural is the Culture

June 23, 2011

The 2010 Census confirmed something Nielsen has been noting for some time: multicultural consumers are rapidly becoming the majority in the United States and their buying power is significant. Understanding their purchasing and media habits is the next big challenge/opportunity facing marketers and brands today. Taking a deep dive into data and trends within the African American, Asian American and Hispanic communities, Nielsen’s Claudia Pardo laid out compelling statistics and a demographic framework shaping the future. It’s clear that marketers and brands will be forced to rethink their perspective — and their share of spend — when it comes to multicultural groups.

“Can anyone in the room honestly say they’re doing everything they can to satisfy the consumption needs of this population?” Pardo asked attendees. “The demographic growth of these groups is simply becoming too great to ignore.” The good news, noted Pardo, is that multicultural groups are actually more loyal to brands and there’s an opportunity to win a consumer for life.

In the past multiculturalism was talked about as a melting pot, but it’s really more like a salad bowl where each group stands out and is different in the way they value their culture and traditions. Pardo offered examples of notable distinctions in the way these diverse groups shop and consume media.

BUYINGHispanics

Spend the most per trip and annually

Shop less often, usually with family

Blacks/African Americans

Shop more frequently than any other ethnicity

The most brand loyal; fewer purchases of private label

Asian Americans

Most likely group to compare prices and shop online

Frequent fewer super centers, dollar stores or convenience stores

WATCHING

Daily Total household TV usage by Race and Origin

Hispanics: 4hrs 35min

Blacks/African Americans: 7hrs 12min

Asian Americans: 3hrs 14min

National Average: 5hrs 11min

Pardo noted that understanding these and other details (such as understanding that multicultural consumers are actually ahead of the curve when it comes to mobile phone adoption, understanding their different TV viewing and online browsing habits, or ensuring that ethnicities are portrayed more often and more appropriately in ads) is key to seizing the massive market opportunity ahead.

“The story here is that within the next five years, multicultural clients will drive 86 percent of the total growth on spending in retail,” Pardo highlighted. “If you look at growth without these groups, you are only addressing 10 percent of the growth.”

Pardo suggested a number of key questions organizations should ask before embarking on an effective multi-cultural strategy:

What is your share of the multi-cultural market?

Do you know this consumer better than your peers?

Are you fishing where the fish are?

Do you have the depth of consumer insight to ensure you deploy the most effective marketing mix?

Is your advertising culturally relevant?

Is your organization ready?

Are you investing in the right structures and incentives to ensure multi-culturalism remains top of mind?

A panel discussion with Roberto Ruiz of Univision, Idaliz Chacon of Procter & Gamble, Angela Joyner of ConAgra Foods and Bill Imada of IW Group followed the presentation and generated the following guidance for organizations looking to engage in effective multicultural strategies:

Create Internal Champions: From creating a Center of Excellence for multicultural marketing, through tracking success via executive scorecards, all panelists agreed that a multi-cultural approach must be a top-down business imperative to avoid a transient, “flavor of the month” approach to engagement.

Scale Your Investment: Bill Imada advised participants to “start small, get some wings, build confidence and go from there.” He maintained that many companies do not exploit what they already know and have in their historic “corporate inventory.” He advised participants to find which current product lines make the most sense in multi-cultural markets, to pick just one of the population segments with the biggest opportunity and build as much cultural learning and competency as possible before roll-out to other populations as part of an organic growth strategy. Idaliz Chacon said it was important to understand the “size of the prize” to build product category and right-size the investment. To close share gaps faster, she indicated that companies should “invest to win,” even disproportionately if necessary. This view was shared by Angela Joyner who stated that trying to drive brand penetration into new markets would potentially require substantial investment as part of a five year strategy to build brand presence and advocacy.

Don’t over-segment: For an effective segmentation strategy, all panelists agreed that it was more important to look for similarities than differences among the focus population and that over-segmentation would decrease the opportunity. Roberto Ruiz stated that the key to effective segmentation is “actionability” and that the nuance of “bi-culturalism” of individuals, for instance being “dominant Hispanic,” while “fascinating,” was completely “worthless” as a segmentation consideration on the basis that people tend to be entirely immersed in both aspects of their culture.

Get out of the Office and Into the Street: “Consumer immersion” was considered the most powerful way to energize a company’s multi-cultural strategy and summarized as “the power of being there and seeing what’s going on.” Leveraging employee ethnic groups within organizations was viewed as a unique asset companies could deploy to generate proprietary insight and delight and win with diverse consumers.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Yet another poor ""reaching"" post. I'm beginning to thing you guys can't actually understand what you read taking quotes and ideas out of context like that. No wonder you think Osama pulled this thing off. You're brain has been turd to mush by the Zionist propaganda mainstream mechanism.

Beleiving in Israel is like beleiving in a chair. It's there, it exists, what more is there to say? Why exactly do you feel a need to assign them a name? What's next, calling people who beleive in America ""Americanists""? What would you call people who beleive in Palestine? Palestinianists? It wouldn't surprise me at all if there were more christian ""zionists"" than jewish ""zionists"". there's certainly more christians in the world than there are jews, and the majority of those christians are reasonable people. They're not going to deny the existance of a country which has been around since the 1940's.

That you are a Zionist or have been conned to accept that satanic movement.

Satanic? Are we getting religious now?

ISRAEL EXISTS AS A COUNTRY. There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Jews bought the land, and eventually a narrow strip was given to them by the UN. The land had been abandoned and nobody wanted it till those damn JOOOS came.

Last Saturday morning there was a C-span call-in with an Israeli journalist and a Palestinian journalist. The Palestinian journalist stated this and the Israeli journalist made no attempt to object or correct:

When the UN partitioned Palestine in 1948, it gave 55% of the land to the Jewish state and 45% of the land to the Arabs, even though, at the time, Jews owned only 10% of the land.

So he didn't object, so what? It certainly doesn't make it true. When Israel was created, there was no such thing as Palestine. In addition to that, something like 90% of the land falling under the Brittish mandate went into creating trans-Jordan, which was specificaly intended as an Arab homeland. I don't see you complaining about all the Jews who were displaced from that area. Finaly, the question of land ownership is irrelevant. The UN mandate was passed by some 33 nations. It became binding at that point. Even if it didn't not have the authority of the UN behind it, the Arabs gave up whatever claims they may have made when they attempted to anhilliate Israel militarily. If they had continued to neogtiate diplomaticaly, perhaps they could claim the moral high ground. As it is, they tried to kill off the Jews, they got their asses kicked, and they lost whatever moral superiority they may have had.

If the UN came in here and partitioned off 55% (or even 5%) of our country to give it to some ethnic group, I would hope there'd be some Americans who'd stand up and fight.

The British were a colonial power ruling over land they had no right to. The proof is in the pudding and the indigenous people have suffered greatly from the League of Nations giving a ""mandate"" over Palestine to the British.

They scrambled planes over New York too. They just got there about 10 minutes too late to do anything.

Even if they did get there before impact, what could they have done? Does ANYONE really think that even after the first impact, the Air Force would shoot down commercial airlners over populated areas? Seriously?

Could you imagine what the CTers would be doing with that if say after the first hit, the remaining 3 planes were shot down? They'd be screaming that the planes weren't even hijacked and the government shot down planes that posed no threat... Oh, wait, nevermind.

If the UN came in here and partitioned off 55% (or even 5%) of our country to give it to some ethnic group, I would hope there'd be some Americans who'd stand up and fight.

That's not exactly how it happened little girl...

You see, before we even had that tragedy called the Holocaust, Jewish folks had been buying up land in a pretty much useless, abadoned strip of land. When the UN created Israel it didn't suddenly take away Palestinian land (as there were no ""Palestinians"" at the time), it just gave sovereignty to the area that had been bought up and no one wanted but the Jews. Arabs started moving back after infrastructure had been built up.

The British were a colonial power ruling over land they had no right to.

The Ottomans lost a war and European powers took control of the area.

The proof is in the pudding and the indigenous people have suffered greatly from the League of Nations giving a ""mandate"" over Palestine to the British.

The indigenous people were called Jews (but I digress). I assume you mean the occupants just before Israel was created. Well, as I stated before, the ""Palestinians"" kept their land (Egypt gobbled up a bit, Jordan some, and Syria the rest). Technically speaking, the creation of Jordan was the creation of the Arab Palestinian nation.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The Hottest NBA Trade Rumors provided daily

Blazers preparing offer for Utah's Paul Millsap

After a series of trades fell through this week, the Trail Blazers have settled on their next target: Utah power forward Paul Millsap.

Although Millsap is a restricted free agent, meaning the Jazz can match any offer, the Blazers are preparing what one source called a ""toxic"" offer designed to exterminate interest from other teams.

Millsap, 24, is a bruising and active player who excels at rebounding. Despite being only 6-foot-8, Millsap last season used his 250-pound frame to average 13.5 points and 8.6 rebounds in 30.1 minutes per game. His 3.3 offensive rebounds per game ranked fourth in the NBA and his 251 offensive rebounds ranked sixth.

If Millsap signs an offer sheet accepting the Blazers’ deal, Utah will have seven days to match the offer. The Jazz is already facing the luxury tax next season with a team salary of more than $73 million. Their finances, and prospects of competing with a lucrative offer to Millsap, took a hit last week when Carlos Boozer ($12.6 million), Mehmet Okur ($9 million) and Kyle Korver ($5.1 million) all exercised options to stay in Utah.

The Blazers figure to exhaust nearly all of their cap space to lock up Millsap. They are $7.7 million under the cap, but can gain an additional $1.65 million by renouncing the rights to Petteri Koponen and Joel Freeland. However, in the process, the Blazers would be assessed with a roughly $450,000 cap hold for having less than 11 players, thus giving them $8.9 million in cap space.

"Meade incinerator plan criticized

Officials decry environmental impact of sewage-burning plant

February 07, 2007|By Phillip McGowan | Phillip McGowan,sun reporter

Fort Meade is proposing to build a sewage sludge incinerator, a prospect that has drawn outrage among western Anne Arundel County civic leaders and criticism from the county's top health official about the potential environmental and health impacts.

The Maryland Department of the Environment is holding a public hearing tonight in Odenton to discuss plans by a Tennessee contractor, Ameresco Federal Solutions, to build the incinerator near the Army post's sewage plant adjacent to the intersection of Routes 32 and 198.

The incinerator would run 24 hours a day on weekdays, disposing of hundreds of tons of sewage a year more cheaply than by trucking the waste away, county and Fort Meade officials said.

MDE spokesman Robert Ballinger declined to disclose details about the incinerator and did not return a phone call yesterday seeking comment. Ameresco Federal Solutions did not reply to an e-mail request for information.

County health officials said that MDE has issued a tentative approval for the incinerator, but a Fort Meade spokeswoman, Summer Barkley, said yesterday in an e-mail that the post will not make a decision about the project for at least six months. She said a series of improvements being made at the post's sewage treatment plant might reduce the volume of sludge.

Civic leaders from Russett, Maryland City and Odenton said they learned of the scheduled public hearing Monday. Members of the Restoration Advisory Board, a group of residents and regulators overseeing Fort Meade's Superfund environmental cleanup, learned of the proposal when contacted yesterday by The Sun.

""I thought we were past the point of the base trying to sneak things through,"" said Zoe B. Draughon, co-chairwoman of the Restoration Advisory Board. ""I am obviously mistaken.""

Barkley referred questions about the timing of the public hearing to MDE.

There are about 170 sewage sludge incinerators in the United States, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The facilities heat the waste to more than 1,500 degrees, turning solid waste into ash, and producing electricity.

The Sun reported last summer that the demand for electricity to operate expanding intelligence systems at the National Security Agency, which has its headquarters at Fort Meade, has left the high-tech eavesdropping agency on the verge of exceeding its power supply.

Activists questioned the placement of an incinerator at the nexus of impending growth expected to sweep over western Anne Arundel. An estimated 20,000 defense workers are expected to settle at Fort Meade over the next four years, a movement that will spawn billions of dollars of residential and office development from Hanover to Laurel and Odenton.

""This is ridiculous,"" said Ray Smallwood, president of the Maryland City Civic Association. ""This is something that needs a lot of study. Haven't they thought about the environmental impact?"" Smallwood added: ""I can't believe they had the audacity to do this.""

Several activists called on MDE to schedule a second hearing to allow for broader public comment. According to an advance copy of county Health Officer Frances B. Phillips's testimony to be read tonight, she criticizes MDE for not adequately advertising the hearing on the proposed incinerator.

Phillips also raises concerns that an incinerator -- which would emit mercury sulfur, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and lead -- could lead to declining air quality and pollute groundwater.

She also points out that there are six public schools on the base, with a combined enrollment of more than 2,000. At least 169 students are known to have asthma, she says.

County Councilman G. James ""Jamie"" Benoit, a Piney Orchard Democrat, decried the incinerator's potential health effect on those children. He is delivering a letter to MDE to voice his displeasure with the project.

David A. Tibbetts, vice president of the Greater Odenton Improvement Association and the organization's environmental chairman, said the county has one of the highest ozone levels in the country. ""And now we are going to add another source of ozone"" Tibbetts said. ""It just doesn't make any sense.""

Phillips in her testimony questions assertions by MDE that incinerator emissions would not exceed air-quality standards set by the EPA. County officials note that MDE does not monitor air quality at Fort Meade.

She also noted that at a meeting at MDE headquarters Jan. 31, state officials said that ""the combustion process itself generally does not produce odors, but that stored sludge awaiting burning is often a source of noxious odor.""

"If, like many of the Badger team, you first discovered F1 during the nineties, the entry list for this year’s Le Mans 24 Hours makes rather nostalgic reading. Consider names like Jean Christophe Bullion, who enjoyed a brief and unspectacular 11 race stint at Sauber in 1995; the entirely forgetable Shinji Nakano; and Christophe Bouchet, a man confirmed as an F1 driver who never got the chance to start a grand prix. They’re names you’d forgotten, careers you thought had ended but continue in the sportscar world.

Add to that list a pair of grand prix winners, a Champ Car title-winner turned F1 flop and BBC Radio 5Live’s diminutive driver-cum-commentator and you’ve got a pretty interesting list of former F1 men on the entry list for this year’s enduro classic, and here we’re naming the whole bunch.

The #7 Peugeot – probably the favourite to claim outright victory – is made up entirely of former F1 drivers, so what better place to start than with the French marque’s entry. Alright, they’re weren’t particularly successful F1 drivers, but they were grand prix driver none the less.

Two-time F1 podium finisher Alex Wurz is effectively leader of the three man squad, the cheery Austrian combining his sportscar commitments with an increasingly prominent role at the FIA (he’ll be president one day and you heard it on Badger first). Alex is joined by former Minardi and Williams man Marc Gene and one-time Super Aguri racer Anthony Davidson in the #7 machine. Nothing less than the win will do for these boys.

In the #8 Peugeot we have another ex-grand prix driver Stephane Sarazzin. Don’t remember the lad? We wouldn’t blame you: he started just one race, in a Minardi, at the Brazilian Grand Prix of 1999. Then seen as an F1 racer of the future, Sarazzin was subbing for the injured Luca Badoer at Interlagos, and actually qualified rather well, taking 17th on the grid and thus out-doing his team-mate – which, funnily enough, was the aforementioned Gene. However Sarazzin would exit his one and only race in spectacular fashion – see the video below for proof.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKkwT_4TMVg

Spinning Steph is joined by Franck Montagny, who ran seven races for Super Aguri in 2006 after they’d fired the slow-and-dangerous Yuji Ide but before they’d hired the just-plain-slow Sakon Yamamoto. Franck was better than both but, unfortunately, he isn’t Japanese. A talented all-rounder, he has raced Champ Cars, Indycar, Superleague and sportscars since his brief F1 stint. Former F3000 front-runner Nicolas Minassian completes the line-up

There are two more ex-F1 drivers in the #9 Peugeot, with Le Mans native Sebastien Bourdais and Pedro Lamy – who had stints with Team Lotus and Minardi in the mid-nineties – completing the French marque’s factory effort.

On to the Audi team, who have just one former F1 man in their ranks: Scotsman Allan McNish. Nishy is a two-time Le Mans winner, having triumphed aboard a Porsche in 1998 and then in an Audi ten years later, and will likely be in the running again this year. The fact he shares his #3 machine with eight-time Le Mans winner and all-round endurance racing god Tom Kristensen should help.

We’ve a pair of Frenchmen to tell you about now. First up is Olivier Panis, who (effectively) leads the #10 Oreca car’s line-up. The 1996 Monaco Grand Prix winner making his fourth appearance at Le Circuit de Sarthe in 2011 and will look to better his best finish of fifth, achieved in 2009. Jean-Christophe Bullion meanwhile will drive the #13 Rebellion Racing entry. The Frenchman drove the majority of the 1995 season for Sauber, scoring a best finish of fifth in Germany, before handing his seat back to Karl Wendlinger, whose place he had taken following the Austrian’s severe injuries at the previous year’s Monaco Grand Prix. Bullion never returned to F1.

He’s not quite French, but Olivier Beretta is near enough that we’ve lumped him in with Panis and Bullion. In fact Olivier was the third (and to date last) Monaco-born F1 driver, contesting the first ten races of the 1994 campaign for French squad Larrousse before getting le boot. Veteran Jan Lammers meanwhile will participate in the #5 Hope Racing entry. Competing in F1 mainly between 1979 and 1982, the Dutchman holds the record for the longest gap between starting two grand prix, having been absent from the sport for a full decade before contesting the final two races of the 1992 campaign for the ailing March team. Ultimately he never scored a point and failed to qualify on 18 occasions. Still, there’s always Hope (get it?)

Christian Klien is the most recent F1 departee contesting Le Mans this year, having raced sporadically for Hispania last season and now competing for Aston Martin at the Circuit de la Sarthe. The 28-year-old Austrian will be behind the wheel of the British marque’s #007 machine, teamed with Brit Darren Turner and Germany’s Stefan Mucke.

Thiago Monteiro is one of the men set to pilot the #15 OAK LMP1 machine. Monteiro drove for Jordan in 2005, landing a podium at the infamous U.S Grand Prix that year, and stayed on as the team became Midland in ’06. He has since raced in the World Touring Car Championship, part-owns the Ocean GP2 team and oversees the career of young countryman Antonio Felix ad Costa. The #49 OAK LMP2 entry meanwhile counts former Prost and Minardi rent-a-driver Shinji Nakano among its pilots.

And here’s one for you geeks: Christophe Bouchet, one of the drivers set to run in the #33 Level Five Motorsport entry, never started a grand prix, But, he was named at French minnows Larrouse for the ’95 campaign, only for the team to fold before he’d had a chance to even qualify. You have been hit with the stick of knowledge.

The most successful F1 driver in the field is Giancarlo Fisichella, three times a race winner for Jordan and Renault. The Italian will compete in the #51 AF Corse Ferrari, the favourite to win the GT class. Victory at last month’s 1000km of Spa cemented that tag, and Fisi’s pursuit of victory is aided no end by another F1 driver – and GT specialist – in the shape of Gianmaria Bruni. The Italian drove for Minardi during the 2004 campaign, taking a best result of 14th at the Malaysian, European and Hungarian Grand Prix. His post-F1 record is far better: three times a GP2 race winner between 2005 and 2006, he has since finished as runner-up in the 2007 FIA World GT championship and won the GT class at Le Mans in 2008.

Finally we’ve got Jan Magnussen, who also competes in the GT class. The Dane ran one race for McLaren in 1995 before landing a full-time ride with Stewart Grand Prix in 1997. His time there was no happy however, and he was given the boot mid-way through 1998 – the same weekend he scored his maiden F1 points. Jan will drive the #74 Corvette at the Circuit de la Sarthe.

"(SportsNetwork.com) - Bruce Arians was a candidate for the vacant Philadelphia
Eagles job, but the powers that be decided Chip Kelly, with no professional
experience, was better equipped.

It didn't take long for Arians to find a job, however, and he will lead the
Arizona Cardinals into the Philadelphia Sunday to battle the Eagles.

Arians, who gained notoriety by filling in for an ill Chuck Pagano with the
Indianapolis Colts last season, has guided the Cardinals to a surprising 7-4
start and has them on the brink of ending a three-year postseason layoff. The
Cardinals are currently in the hunt for a wild card spot since it appears the
Seattle Seahawks will take home the NFC West title.

The Eagles are also flirting with the idea of making a playoff run in Kelly's
first season at the helm and are even with the Dallas Cowboys for first place
in the NFC East. The Cowboys own the tiebreaker after beating the Eagles a few
weeks back at Lincoln Financial Field, where the Cardinals hope to find
similar success.

Arizona has won four in a row, including three straight after the bye, and
hammered the Colts, 40-11, on Sunday in the desert. A 26-yard touchdown
reception by Larry Fitzgerald and a 22-yard interception return for a score by
Karlos Dansby highlighted a 20-point second quarter for the Cardinals, who
racked up 410 yards of offense and hope to gain some more attention in the
competitive NFC.

""I think this was a respect game,"" said Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer,
who threw for 314 yards with a pair of TD passes to Fitzgerald. ""I don't think
we are well respected throughout the league, and that's not anybody's fault
but our own. But I think we are better than people think.""

The Cardinals deserve a lot of credit with wins over Detroit, Carolina and
Indianapolis. Still, veteran defensive lineman Darnell Dockett feels Arizona
is slighted each week.

""You know what's funny?"" Dockett said. ""Whenever the Cardinals win it's always
what the other team didn't do. It's never what we forced other teams to do. We
understand that. Everyone says, 'They didn't beat nobody, they didn't beat
nobody.""

Well, the Colts aren't nobodies. They, too, are in the mix for a playoff spot
and just got waxed by their former assistant coach in Arians, whose squad last
won four in a row to start the 2012 season and hasn't prevailed in five
straight games since the St. Louis Cardinals won six in a row during the 1977
campaign under head coach Don Coryell.

The Cardinals hope to keep the momentum going and keep pressing for a chance
at reaching the playoffs.

""We are in the hunt,"" Arizona cornerback Jerraud Powers said. ""That's all you
can ask for. It seems like everyone is believing in one another.""

Meanwhile, the Eagles are feeling just as confident with three straight wins
and last won four in a row to close out the 2011 campaign at 8-8. Eagles
quarterback Nick Foles was still slinging the ball for the University of
Arizona and completed 387-of-560 passes for 4,334 yards and 28 touchdowns for
the Wildcats.

The second-year pro, who was recently crowned the starter, is now lighting up
opposing defenses at a rapid rate and is building confidence in himself, with
the coaches and his teammates.

""He has the utmost confidence in himself,"" said Eagles wide receiver Riley
Cooper. ""He is a great quarterback and he should. He is the general out there.
We are all listening to him. He does a great job.""

Cooper has been the beneficiary of Foles' resurgence and is second on the
Eagles with 592 yards on 31 catches. His seven touchdown receptions is tied
with DeSean Jackson. Foles, though, is the reason for the success and has
1,554 yards with 16 TD passes and no interceptions for a 128.0 rating. His
rating ranks first in the NFL and has six games this season with a rating of
100 or better.

During the Eagles' winning streak, Foles' QB rating is 152.8. He has thrown
199 consecutive passes without an interception and his 9.6 yards per attempt
is first in the league. Foles has the Eagles flying high and helped them halt
a 10-game home losing streak with last week's 24-16 win over the Washington
Redskins. He threw for 298 yards and did not have a touchdown pass. He didn't
need to because LeSean McCoy ran for 77 yards and a pair of touchdowns.

""I feel like we've put ourselves in a good position,"" Foles said. ""That's all
you can ask for, especially heading into the bye week. Especially with winning
our last game at home, (we're) moving in the right direction and just
continuing to change the atmosphere here. The coaches here are doing a great
job and the players are doing a great job of buying in, so I think that we
have to keep going in that direction and keep leaning on each other, and we'll
see what happens.""

The New York Giants did no favors by losing to the Cowboys on Sunday, so it's
a tight rope to walk in the division.

Speaking of walking the line, Michael Vick said Foles deserves to remain the
start for how well he's played. Vick is no fool and believes in the idiom if
it's not broke, don't fix it.

""In all honesty, in all fairness, how can you take a guy out of the game who's
been playing so well?"" Vick said. ""I've been in this stage before, and I know
what it's like. I understand the position that this team is in, and the one
thing I never want to do is be a distraction or put our team or our coaches in
a position where they feel like they're not doing the right thing or I feel
like they're not doing the right thing.""

Philadelphia has been doing the right thing offensively and is averaging 33.3
points and 453 yards during the winning streak.

Jackson, Cooper and McCoy have been Philly's big three in recent weeks, while
Jackson is 15 yards shy of the third 1,000-yard season of his career. AFter
three straight weeks of rushing for no more than 55 yards, McCoy had 155 yards
on 25 carries at Green Bay, then ran for 77 yards on 20 carries versus the
Redskins to surpass running backs coach Duce Staley for third on the team's
all-time rushing list with 4,875 yards.

McCoy also reached the 1,000-mark for the third time in his career and didn't
know it until it was brought up to him.

""I did know this though, I had 10 yards to pass Duce,"" McCoy said. ""So I knew
that was going to happen.""

The shifty back averages about half of 10 yards (4.7 ypg) for an Eagles squad
looking for revenge versus the Cardinals after last season's 27-6 loss on
Sept. 23 at University of Phoenix Stadium. Philadelphia's most recent victory
in the series was a 48-20 home rout on Thanksgiving Night of 2008, and the
Eagles have taken five of the last nine regular-season bouts since 2000 with
their former division rivals.

Including the 2008 NFC Championship, which the Cardinals won by a 32-25 count
to advance to their only Super Bowl, Arizona has won three in a row against
the Eagles.

WHAT TO WATCH FOR

The Eagles give up a league-worst 300.1 passing yards per game and are 31st in
total yards allowed (417.9). So what can they expect from Fitzgerald, one of
the top wide receivers in the game?

Fitzgerald caught nine passes for 114 yards and a touchdown in the last
meeting with the Eagles and has played them four times in his career, posting
26 catches for 418 yards and six TDs. No matter who is covering Fitzgerald,
whether it's Cary Williams, Brandon Boykin or Bradley Fletcher, who is
bothered by a pectoral muscle and is questionable Sunday, the Eagles will
experience some trouble.

Palmer gave some insight on what it's like to cover Fitzgerald, who eclipsed
the 11,000-yard mark in his career. He is the youngest to reach that mark.

""Any time you have Larry 1-on-1 down in the red zone, it's not a good matchup
for the other team,"" Palmer said.

Floyd can be an issue, too, so it's important for an improved Eagles defense
to force Palmer into making mistakes. Palmer's known for erratic play at
times, but the former Heisman Trophy winner can also shred defenses. Just ask
the Colts, who failed to pick off a pass.

Williams, though, is impressed with how well the unit is playing.

""We're getting there and I also think we all understand that a lot of work is
ahead to get to where we need to be,"" said Williams. ""The play up front has
improved, which impacts everyone. I think that confidence is the big reason.
Everybody understands what the coaches are looking for and we've all worked
hard studying that. You see the results. We all feel like it's improving.""

Speaking of play up front, give credit to big men Vinny Curry, Fletcher Cox
and Cedric Thornton. They have combined for eight sacks, while Curry and
linebacker Connor Barwin have four apiece. LB Trent Cole and Cox each have
posted three sacks.

The Cardinals have some muscle of their own on defense and sack master John
Abraham has seven so far. Defensive end Calais Campbell has 5 1/2 sacks and
Dockett owns 4 1/2, while veteran linebacker Karlos Dansby leads the Cardinals
with 88 tackles.

Dansby registered five stops against Indianapolis and an interception. Look
for him to disrupt Philadelphia's run game by shooting the gaps. Colts
quarterback Andrew Luck was rattled often in Sunday's game.

""They created a bit of a hornet's nest,"" Luck said of the defensive pressure.

Don't sleep on Arizona's secondary either with rookie Tyrann Mathieu, stud
Patrick Peterson, Powers and Yeremiah Bell. They, too, will have their hands
full with Jackson, Cooper and tight end Brent Celek. Celek hasn't been much of
a factor lately, which is why he could be a pest Sunday.

OVERALL ANALYSIS

The Cardinals seem to give the Eagles fits lately and will do so again at the
Linc. The Nick Foles show has to have some sort of commercial break and it
will be good to get that out of the way now instead of later. A loss won't
impact much in the NFC East because it's still wide open.

Arizona is fighting with the Eagles and many other teams in a push toward the
postseason and it will be up to Palmer and the defense to make that happen.
The Eagles do have some nice weapons, but the Cardinals can counter that with
their impressive defense.

Cardinals defensive coordinator Todd Bowles performed the same role in a
limited capacity for Philadelphia last season, so expect his familiarity with
the opponent to come in handy.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Flow straightener

Combined processing of PBT and LSR

The combination of different materials to create multi-functional components in a single production step is one of the domains of plastics processing. Flow straighteners in shower heads are a good example: thanks to the elastic LSR nozzles integrated in the solid PBT main body, scale can be removed with ease.

Flow straighteners for shower heads are produced, inspected and packaged fully automatically in a production cell built around an electric two-component injection moulding machine from the ALLDRIVE series. This enables efficient high-volume production of this complex hard/soft combination.

Basic specifications

Technology

MachineFlow straighteners for shower heads are produced from PBT and LSR on an electric two-component ALLROUNDER 570 A, which is equipped with two size 170 injection units. Two pre-moulded parts and two finished components are produced in a cycle time of 40 s in a consistently high part quality.to electric machines

Robotic systemTransfer technology is the ideal answer for hard/soft combinations such as the flow straightener. The vertical MULTILIFT V robotic system turns the pre-moulded parts over in the mould. In addition, it removes the finished parts and transfers them first to a cooling station with integrated visual inspection, then on to a packaging system.to linear robotic systems

Process

Multi-component injection mouldingFor the combined processing of thermoplastics and liquid silicone in a single mould, the necessary thermal separation presents a challenge: while the PBT needs to be cooled, the LSR cross-links at high temperatures. For a fully automated process, transfer technology offers the ideal solution.to the process

Liquid silicone injection moulding (LSR)For sprueless part production, both the PBT main body and the LSR nozzles of the flow straightener are directly injected using hot and cold-runner technology. As a result, no non-recyclable waste is generated. Efficient use of materials is also ensured by an optimised emptying system for the LSR dosing unit.to the process

Industry

Technical injection mouldingIn technical injection moulding, high-precision components can be produced for a wide variety of applications.

Micronutrient Deficiencies Throughout the World

April 24, 2017

Julia Bird

The discovery of vitamins a little over one century ago was incredibly important for the field of nutrition (1). At last, we had found the key to preventing vitamin deficiencies! Knowing about the vitamins meant that medical questions that had puzzled humans for centuries – why does fresh citrus fruit cure scurvy, but a syrup made from the juice does not? – could be reliably answered (2). Despite this grand leap in the understanding of nutrition, however, vitamin and mineral deficiencies still plague us around the globe. While we know in general which micronutrients and how much most people need to stay healthy, making sure that everyone has access to micronutrients is more problematic. Each region in the world has its own nutrition concerns. The problem of “hidden hunger,” when people may get enough calories but the micronutrient content of their diet is lacking, is improving but there is still a long way to go (3). Which micronutrient deficiencies are found throughout the world?

South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific

South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, comprising countries such as China, Indonesia, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia, have mostly showed a large improvement in micronutrient status in their population over the past decades (3). General programs to support economic growth have raised the standard of living for many people living in developing Asian countries, and staple food fortification has been able to reduce specific micronutrient deficiencies such as iodine and iron. Despite these gains, deficiencies in iron and vitamin A are still prevalent in some risk groups: 27 million school age children, 7.5 million pregnant women and 96 million non-pregnant women in the region are affected by anemia, while 13 percent of pre-school children and 21 percent of pregnant women are affected by vitamin A deficiency (4).

Eastern Europe and Central Asia

Low- and middle-income countries in Europe and Central Asia have shown a modest improvement in reducing micronutrient deficiencies (3). In this region, however vitamins A and D, iodine, iron, zinc, folate and thiamine are marked as micronutrients of special concern (5). The rates of deficiencies vary depending on the country, as local laws, the economic situation, cultural trends and the environment can affect supply of vitamins and minerals. In particular, iodine deficiency in central Europe is common, and is very much impacted by national policies regarding iodine fortification (6). Seasonable variations in the availability of different foods can affect dietary intakes and nutrient status in Europe. For example, more fruits and vegetables are eaten in the summer and autumn months, leading to a better folate status in the general population in Slovakia (7). Certain vulnerable populations are at greater risk of micronutrient deficiency. These groups include pregnant women and young children, the elderly, people with a low socioeconomic status, and those affected by chronic disease (8-10).

Latin America and the Caribbean

Micronutrient nutrition in Latin American and the Caribbean has improved in the past few years, and rates of deficiency tend to be the lowest of the low- and middle-income countries (3). In fact, all countries in this area of the world reduced their prevalence of hidden hunger in the period 1995-2011 (3). Despite these relative improvements, micronutrient deficiencies have an impact on health for a significant proportion of people in this area of the world. Iron deficiency anemia and zinc deficiency remain a problem for women of childbearing age and children aged under 6 years (11, 12). While vitamin B12 deficiency is not monitored as well as other micronutrients, an incidence greater than 10 percent is reported for vulnerable groups in some countries, such as women aged 13 to 49 in Colombia, and children aged 6 months to 5 years in Guatemala. Rates of vitamin and mineral deficiencies can vary greatly between countries. For example, vitamin A deficiency in young children has been virtually eradicated in Guatemala and Nicaragua, yet is a severe public health problem in Colombia, Mexico, and Haiti (13).

One micronutrient success story has been the use of folic acid fortification to improve folate status and reduce the occurrence of neural tube defects in Latin American and the Caribbean. The introduction of mandatory folic acid fortification for almost all countries has led to a dramatic reduction in the percentage of the population with folate deficiency (14). In turn, surveillance of neural tube defects shows a decrease of one- to two-thirds compared to the pre-fortification period (15). Carefully designed interventions such as staple food fortification, and that focus on vulnerable groups, are needed to further improve micronutrient nutrition in Latin America and the Caribbean (12).

Middle East and North Africa

The nutrition situation in the Middle East and North Africa has improved substantially in the last decades. Many countries are undergoing an advanced nutrition transition, whereby there is a modest reduction in micronutrient malnutrition, while rates of overweight and obesity are rapidly increasing (16). Unfortunately, the complex security situation in several countries (Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Syria) has further increased food insecurity, leading to widespread acute and chronic under nutrition, especially in young children and pregnant women (16).

The vitamins and minerals most often found to be deficient in nutritional surveys in the region include calcium, iodine, iron, vitamin A, vitamin D, and folate (16). Food fortification programs in the area are patchy, and while many countries have dietary guidelines for individuals that promote a healthful diet, their uptake has been limited (16). Anemia is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency in the Middle East, and can affect more than half of some countries. Vitamin D deficiency has been reported for many countries despite plentiful sunshine; this relates to few dietary sources and wearing traditional clothing that blocks sunlight from reaching the skin.

Several countries including Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait have mandatory wheat flour fortification policies in place. All these countries fortify with folic acid and iron, and some include zinc and other vitamins as well. However, rice and maize are also staple foods in these countries and are not fortified, hence micronutrient deficiencies remain widespread despite the existence of fortification.

West, Central and Sub-Saharan Africa

The majority of countries showing an increase in hidden hunger over the past years were located in West, Central and Southern Africa. These results do not bode well for the social and economic development in countries affected by a high prevalence of under nutrition (3). The causes of micronutrient deficiencies in Africa are multi-factorial and relate to poor economic development, unstable governments that neglect critical investments into education, health and infrastructure, and food insecurity related to harsh agricultural environments (17). The high prevalence of vitamin and mineral deficits, such as iron deficiency anemia, zinc deficiency and vitamin A deficiency will only be reduced when the underlying causes of poverty are alleviated.

In some countries in southern Africa, commitment to improving the nutritional status of the population has shown positive results. For example, a mandatory fortification program for maize and wheat flour in South Africa has been effective in improving vitamin and mineral intakes (18, 19). There is still room for improvement in South Africa, however; it is one of 48 countries worldwide prioritized as having an “unfinished fortification” program (20).

High-Income Countries

While developing countries bear the greatest burden of micronutrient deficiencies around the world, they still exist in high-income countries. The considerable resources of high-income countries mean that the micronutrient status of their populations is studied in greater detail than the rest of the world and give a better estimate of the true rate. Comprehensive a representative analyses of U.S. populations find that 5 percent or more is affected by deficiencies in vitamins B6, C and D, and almost 10 percent of women of child-bearing age are affected by low body iron (21). In Europe, international comparisons find that at least half of certain population groups do not meet recommendations. Intakes of thiamine in Italian women, B6 in women from many countries, and vitamin C in Scandinavian men and male smokers are clearly too low (22, 23). Also, intakes of both vitamin D and E are low for most people living in Northern, Western and Southern Europe (22, 23). A lack of education about nutrient-dense diets and poor food choices are a major contributor to micronutrient deficiencies in high-income countries.

Maizey hasn’t ever been inside this house.

In winter, she and her son Joe,

She now goes in and out without hesitation—
well, when she sniffed the snow out the backdoor
early this morning,
she turned around and came back in. Later,
she stepped out onto the porch—
and came back after one trot round

"The quantum computing apocalypse is imminent

Shlomi Dolev is the Chair Professor and founder of the Computer Science department of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. He is the author of Self-Stabilization. Shlomi also is a cybersecurity entrepreneur and the co-founder and chief scientist of Secret Double Octopus.

In the ancient world, they used cubits as an important data unit, but the new data unit of the future is the qubit — the quantum bits that will change the face of computing.

Quantum bits are the basic units of information in quantum computing, a new type of computer in which particles like electrons or photons can be utilized to process information, with both “sides” (polarizations) acting as a positive or negative (i.e. the zeros and ones of traditional computer processing) alternatively or at the same time.

According to experts, quantum computers will be able to create breakthroughs in many of the most complicated data processing problems, leading to the development of new medicines, building molecular structures and doing analysis going far beyond the capabilities of today’s binary computers.

The elements of quantum computing have been around for decades, but it’s only in the past few years that a commercial computer that could be called “quantum” has been built by a company called D-Wave. Announced in January, the D-Wave 2000Q can “solve larger problems than was previously possible, with faster performance, providing a big step toward production applications in optimization, cybersecurity, machine learning and sampling.”

IBM recently announced that it had gone even further — and that it expected that by the end of 2017 it would be able to commercialize quantum computing with a 50-qubit processor prototype, as well as provide online access to 20-qubit processors. IBM’s announcement followed the September Microsoft announcement of a new quantum computing programming language and stable topological qubit technology that can be used to scale up the number of qubits.

Taking advantage of the physical “spin” of quantum elements, a quantum computer will be able to process simultaneously the same data in different ways, enabling it to make projections and analyses much more quickly and efficiently than is now possible.

There are significant physical issues that must be worked out, such as the fact that quantum computers can only operate at cryogenic temperatures (at 250 times colder than deep space) — but Intel, working with Netherlands firm QuTech, is convinced that it is just a matter of time before the full power of quantum computing is unleashed.

“Our quantum research has progressed to the point where our partner QuTech is simulating quantum algorithm workloads, and Intel is fabricating new qubit test chips on a regular basis in our leading-edge manufacturing facilities,” said Dr. Michael Mayberry, corporate vice president and managing director of Intel Labs. “Intel’s expertise in fabrication, control electronics and architecture sets us apart and will serve us well as we venture into new computing paradigms, from neuromorphic to quantum computing.”

The difficulty in achieving a cold enough environment for a quantum computer to operate is the main reason they are still experimental, and can only process a few qubits at a time — but the system is so powerful that even these early quantum computers are shaking up the world of data processing. On the one hand, quantum computers are going to be a boon for cybersecurity, capable of processing algorithms at a speed unapproachable by any other system.

By looking at problems from all directions — simultaneously — a quantum computer could discover anomalies that no other system would notice, and project to thousands of scenarios where an anomaly could turn into a security risk. Like with a top-performing supercomputer programmed to play chess, a quantum-based cybersecurity system could see the “moves” an anomaly could make later on — and quash it on the spot.

The National Security Agency, too, has sounded the alarm on the risks to cybersecurity in the quantum computing age.

“Quantum computing will definitely be applied anywhere where we’re using machine learning, cloud computing, data analysis. In security that [means] intrusion detection, looking for patterns in the data, and more sophisticated forms of parallel computing,” according to Kevin Curran, a cybersecurity researcher at Ulster University and IEEE senior member.

But the computing power that gives cyber-defenders super-tools to detect attacks can be misused, as well. Last year, scientists at MIT and the University of Innsbruck were able to build a quantum computer with just five qubits, conceptually demonstrating the ability of future quantum computers to break the RSA encryption scheme.

That ability to process the zeros and ones at the same time means that no formula based on a mathematical scheme is safe. The MIT/Innsbruck team is not the only one to have developed cybersecurity-breaking schemes, even on these early machines; the problem is significant enough that representatives of NIST, Toshiba, Amazon, Cisco, Microsoft, Intel and some of the top academics in the cybersecurity and mathematics worlds met in Toronto for the yearly Workshop on Quantum-Safe Cryptography last year.

The National Security Agency, too, has sounded the alarm on the risks to cybersecurity in the quantum computing age. The NSA’s “Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite and Quantum Computing FAQ” says that “many experts predict a quantum computer capable of effectively breaking public key cryptography” within “a few decades,” and that the time to come up with solutions is now.

According to many experts, the NSA is far too conservative in its prediction; many experts believe that the timeline is more like a decade to a decade and a half, while others believe that it could happen even sooner.

And given the leaps in progress that are being made on almost a daily process, a commercially viable quantum computer offering cloud services could happen even more quickly; the D-Wave 2000Q is called that because it can process 2,000 qubits. That kind of power in the hands of hackers makes possible all sorts of scams that don’t even exist yet.

For example, forward-looking hackers could begin storing encrypted information now, awaiting the day that fast, cryptography-breaking quantum computing-based algorithms are developed. While there’s a possibility that the data in those encrypted files might be outdated, there is likely to be more than enough data for hackers to use in various identity theft schemes, among other things.

It’s certain that the threats to privacy and information security will only multiply in the coming decades.

In fact, why wait? Hackers are very well-funded today, and it certainly wouldn’t be beyond their financial abilities to buy a quantum computer and begin selling encryption-busting services right now. It’s likely that not all the cryptography-breaking algorithms will work on all data, at least for now — this is a threat-in-formation — but chances are that at least some of them will, meaning that even now, cyber-criminals could utilize the cryptography-breaking capabilities of quantum computers, and perhaps sell those services to hackers via the Dark Web.

That NSA document that predicted “decades” before quantum computers become a reality was written at the beginning of 2016, which shows how much progress has been made in barely a year and a half. The solution lies in the development of quantum-safe cryptography, consisting of information theoretically secure schemes, hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography and exotic-sounding technologies like lattice-based cryptography, multivariate cryptography (like the “Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar scheme”), and even supersingular elliptic curve isogeny cryptography.

These, and other post-quantum cryptography schemes, will have to involve “algorithms that are resistant to cryptographic attacks from both classical and quantum computers,” according to the NSA. Whatever the case, it’s certain that the threats to privacy and information security will only multiply in the coming decades, and that data encryption will proceed in lockstep with new technological advances.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Indian surgeons, Oz aid give Iraqi boy new life

Undertaking a rare and complicated brain surgery, doctors at the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi have saved the life of a 14-year-old Iraqi student. The expensive surgery was funded by Iraqi Christians in Australia, doctors said here Tuesday.

""It was a very complicated operation. The planning and execution of the surgery was very, very complex and we had not handled such a case till this boy came in,"" Pranav Kumar, a leading neurosurgeon at the hospital, told.

Ahmed Hashmi from Iraq was brought to Apollo hospital with a large aneurysm in one of four main arteries in the brain. He had already suffered a stroke, resulting in slurred speech and weakness of right side of his body.

""To stop any further risk, the diseased artery had to be blocked immediately. However, the preliminary tests revealed that the brain could not have tolerated closure of this abnormal artery,"" Pranav Kumar added.

Shahin Nooreyezdan, a member of the team of doctors who treated Ahmed, said: ""Though brain is a very small part of the body, it needs at least 20 percent of the total blood supply. But this problem was obstructing blood flow to his brain. The aneurysm was like a ticking time-bomb, capable of bursting anytime and causing massive brain haemorrhage.""

""Had it been left untreated, Ahmed's life span would have been very short,"" added Hash Rastogi, another senior doctor at Apollo.

The surgery was carried out in two steps - on Dec 4 and Dec 11. The entire expenses of the surgery -Rs.1.4 million - were met by Iraqi Christians based in Australia.

""In stage one of the treatment, a delicate bypass surgery was carried out on his brain successfully. In this operation, a small artery from his face was connected to one of the fine arteries in the brain. This resumed blood supply to brain,"" Nooreyezdan said.

""A week later, we successfully blocked the abnormal artery. ""The treatment has defused the time bomb, which Ahmed was carrying in his brain,"" Rastogi added.

Wearing a green hospital dress, holding a gift pack and a chocolate, Ahmed was happy. ""I have suffered a lot and thank God I am out of it now. I thank all my doctors for giving me a new""He is out of danger. But, he needs to take care against any head injury in future,"" he said.

Ahmed, whose father is dead, belongs to a poor family. After he was diagnosed with the disease and Iraqi doctors were not in a condition to cure him, his sister contacted a foundation in Australia on the internet and requested help.

""This is how Ahmed got the funding and now you can see him smiling,"" said Walid M. Albakili, another doctor and research fellow in charge of Gulf and Arab region. life.""

""I have already missed my school for six months and am eager to get back soon,"" said the 14-year-old who wishes to see Taj Mahal before leaving Delhi for his homeland.

"Cuc Phuong is very diverse in flora species composition structure. With such an area equaling to 0.07 % out of the total area nationwide, it accounts for 57.93 % of flora families, 36.09 % of genetic diversity and 17.27 % of the species as compared with total figures for the country. Cuc Phuong NP has 20,473 ha of forest out of the total land area of 22,200 ha (accounting for 92.2 %). The vegetation cover here is the type of evergreen tropical rainforest. According to Thai Van Trung (1976), Cuc Phuong belongs to the type of closed humid evergreen tropical rainforest. Cuc Phuong has a considerable area of primary forest, mainly focused on the limestone mountain area and at valleys in the centre of the NP. It is the special location that leads to the rich species composition structure of the park. Cuc Phuong contains many non-indigenous plant species established with many indigenous ones. Representation of the indigenous species is those of Lauraceae, Magnoliaceae and Meliaceae families while those species of Dipterocarpaceae family is representative of non-indigenous species from the warmer southern region. Representative of those coming from the north are those of Fagaceae species. Cuc Phuongisan area of​​significantprimary forest, mainlyonlimestonemountainsandvalleysinthecenter ofthe park.As aspecial placetoholdthe rich plant species inCuc Phuong.

Survey results of recent years (2008) recorded 2,234 species of 917 genera, 231 families. Many of them are of high value: 430 medicinal plant species, 229 edible plant species, 240 species can be used as medicine, dye, 137 species can provide tannin, etc; 13 species are listed in Vietnam Red Data Book 2000 and IUCN Red List 2004. Some outstanding species are Dalbergia tonkinensis; Parashorea chinensis, Erythrophloeum fordii; and Nageia fleyri. There are 11 endemic plant species, including Camellia cucphuongensis; Begonia cucphuongensis; Pistacia cucphuongensis; Amorphophallus dzui; Vietorchis aurea; Carex trongii, etc.

The vertebrate animal species in Cuc Phuong is rich and diverse, there are 133 species, accounting for 51.35 % of the total nationwide (259 species). For birds, Cuc Phuong NP is assessed by Birdlife International as an Important Bird Area of Vietnam. It has recorded here now 336 species, accounting for 39.25 % of the total bird species nationwide (856 species). For reptiles, Cuc Phuong NP has 76 species, accounting for 26.67 % of the nation’s total figure (296 species). For amphibians, Cuc Phuong NP has 46 species, accounting for 28.39% of the nation’s total figure (162 species). For fish, Cuc Phuong NP has 66 species, accounting for 10.81 % of the nation’s total figure of fresh water fish species (610 species).In total 659 vertebrate species that 85 species have recorded in Vietnam Red Book, some Cuc Phuong endemic species such as Trachipythecus francoisi delacouri, Callosciurus erythraeus cucphuongensis, Tropidophorus cucphuongensis, Rana maosonensis, Pterocryptis cucphuongensis etc.

- Invertebratefauna: The invertebrate fauna in Cuc Phuong is even more abundant and diverse. In the period from 2000-2008, about 7,400 invertebrate animal samples have been collected, including 1,670 species and species types of insect, 14 crustacean species, 18 species and types of species of myriapod, 16 spider-shaped species, 52 species and species types of annelid, 129 species and species types of mollusc, and many other species of lower animal. However, it is due to the fact that the lower animal species did not get much attention and research on these species have been rarely done; the figures mentioned are the preliminary ones only. In reality, the invertebrates in Cuc Phuong are extremely rich and diverse, it is estimated the real figures are much higher.

- Palaeontology: In addition to the relics and fossils of prehistoric animals have been discovered and excavated and published before. Recently, in 2000, a marine animal fossil has been found in CucPhuongNational Park. Fossils exposed on the suface of limestone rock, it appeared in Dong Giao fomation to Middle Triassic (T2), it is about 200 to 230 million years, including at least 12 intact vertebra, 10 ribs and some others. The fossil has been preliminarily determined Placodontia species (reptiles tooth blade). According to scientists, this is first discovery in Southeast Asiaon Placodontia.

Socio-economicsituation

- Ethnic: CucPhuongNational Park is located in the region of 14 communes that include two mainly ethnic groups. Muong ethnic accounted for 76.6% of the total population in the region and Kinh ethnic is accounted for 23.4%. Two ethnic groups have been the oldest community living both in terms of economic and cultural. In recent years, in the process of innovation, market economy has penetrated into the Muong villages that are gradually losing the cultural characteristics. However, there are some villages in remote areas still retaining the customs, festival of Gongs ... that bring imbued Muong’s culture.

"Nudists stripped down and shouted anti-corporate slogans when a second approval for the nude ban passed in City Hall.

You've got to admire their tenacity.

In January, a judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by San Francisco nudists that claimed their First Amendment right to free speech was violated by Supervisor Scott Wiener’s nudity ban. But the decision didn’t deter nudists from their fight to strip down in The City – they’ve filed an amended suit and are staging a protest and ‘body freedom parade’ this Saturday.

The protest is scheduled at noon on July 20, in front of City Hall. The parade will follow, but there’s no word on what route it will take. Under the ban, nudists face a $100 fine for their first offense, with increases for additional infractions.

The amended lawsuit includes five plaintiffs: Russell “Trey” Allen, Mitch Hightower, George Davis, Russell Mills, and Oxane “Gypsy” Taub. Although they initially sued The City for alleged free speech violations, they’ve now taken a different approach. The new suit alleges that the nudity ban has been enforced against them in a discriminatory fashion.

The lawsuit states that several plaintiffs were arrested for baring it all at a rally on February 1, and the others were arrested during a nude dance on February 27. However, plaintiffs were not arrested when they participated in nude activities led by other organizations, leading them to believe that they are being targeted by The City.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

If your Keyword uses language specification you can configure this by doing:

With just a fortnight left till CNY, the OUG morning market was in a frenzy. You know things are getting serious when RELA is deployed to control traffic. Roads once accessible to traffic were closed and the extra space occupied by vendors selling fireworks, waxed meat, biscuits, sea cucumber, dried mushrooms (a lot of 'em!), etc.

While I was walking past Restoran New Sun Ho, saw another example of the globalized Malaysian breakfast-- roti canai with salmon sashimi. One day I might start seeing roti sashimi on the menu.

Lunch was a simple meal of chicken porridge with a can of fried dace. Very traditional fare.

CNY was around the corner, so we spruced up the house a bit. Bought a can of white paint and repainted the metal grills at the living room. Was a little woozy after inhaling the paint fumes. Felt better after we had dinner at Dao Dao. A plate of tofu with mixed vegetables and Marmite chicken really hit the spot.

Lego was very much a part of my childhood. Back then, I saved my pocket money, angpao money, and Cantonese Association award money to buy Lego. Back then, the cheapest set cost MYR5+. I think the most expensive model I bought was around MYR80+. Just the normal Lego, for age 5-12. Back then, the only other ranges were Duplo and Technic. So many varieties have popped up after the Lego resurgence. Today we have:

Star Wars

Creator

Minifigures

City

Friends

Nexo Knights

Ninjago

DC Comics Superheroes

The Batman Movie

Marvel Superheroes

Elves

Disney

Juniors

Architecture

Mindstorms

Scooby Doo

Minecraft

Speed

Angry Birds

Ideas

Superhero Girls

Pening kan? However, all those varieties don't interest me. Technic seems way cooler to me with all those gears, shafts, and moving parts. A sort of kiddy mechanical engineering. More worth it to pay for design and complex parts, rather than paying for copyright costs. Back then, they had pneumatic models, these days, electric motors. Goes without saying that I didn't buy any Technic models back then due to the cost factor. Twenty four years later, I got to assemble my first Technic model-- a Christmas gift from KH. Muacks. He bought me a Lego Technic Drag Racer (42050) which is kind of cool because it has a huge motor block with moving pistons, front wheel steering, big wheely bar, car body that can be raised, and a hidden jack that can be used to pose the drag racer in wheely position.

Closer and closer to CNY, the market was getting redder and redder. The pace was catching up. Definitely more people than usual judging from the crowds and the lack of parking. Mum stopped at a fishmonger's truck and I was shocked by a large grouper that was on the weighing scale. It was not the size of it that caught my eye, but the fact that it looked like it was dripping in cum! Guess bukkake is not uncommon among fish. Haha. On a serious note, the slime is a layer of mucus that helps fish with gas transport, provide protection, and reduce turbulence in the water.

Ventured to Taman Bukit Desa for Sarawak Laksa at Charlie's Cafe because we were bored of the food options at OUG. Taman Bukit Desa was very peaceful compared to the chaos at the market. Always quiet at that neck of the woods.

On the way home, we turned into Pearl Shopping Gallery, an interesting new addition to Pearl Point. Located across the road from Jalan Sepadu, it's connected to the old wing via a bridge. Yes, it's always about bridges with shopping malls these days. Inside, there's a small Village Grocer and multiple food establishments (for some reason they have three Korean restaurants). Notable outlets are Paradise Dynasty, Kyochon, Go Noodle House, Kin Kin Pan Mee, and Powerplant. There's also Cremeo that serves premium soft serve ice cream. Will give an update as I try the food outlets there!

After a whole month of babysitting, mum and I finally had the chance to go to the market. The first visit of 2017. With all the year end holidays out of the way, it finally dawned on people that the Lunar Chinese New Year was less than a month away! Start the panic buying! The earliest merchants to start the ball rolling were the those who sold religious paraphernalia. They had already started stocking all sorts of special paper offerings, fancy joss sticks, and even the stuff needed to Pai Ti Kong were already on sale. Breakfast was our favourite curry noodles in the alley.

In the afternoon, KH came over to my place to chill (kind of like a chaperoned type of paktor). We would just laze on the sofa and chat. Sometimes, we would play our current addiction-- LINE Rangers. So cute, so pointless, and yet... Haha. Received a call from SK and we were out to The Coffee Sessions. More updates from SK regarding her family issues over a cup of mocha and a side of fries. People never fail to surprise. When you thought that they've hit rock bottom, there seems to be more to go!

SK stayed on for dinner while KH returned home. Just a simple meal at nearby Restoran 83. A very satisfying dinner of pork noodles, grilled stingray, fried rice, and chicken soup. Remember when it was such a craze to have Portugese style grilled stingray at the Midvalley Megamall Food Court? Ages ago...

For mum and I, church is the best place to usher in the new year. Bilingual mass started at 10:30 PM and ended fifteen minutes shy of midnight, giving parishioners enough time to find a good location to watch the fireworks display outside (some places actually started the fireworks five minutes before midnight). And a snack box was provided too. By the time we got home, it was past 1:00 AM and we had mass to attend on the 1st of January too! Not that it was mandatory, just that I had traffic warden duties to perform. A thankless job that nobody wants to do. You have to come to church before the crowd, and leave only after everyone does. And its not pleasant when the weather is hot. And drivers are a cranky bunch. Basically, traffic wardens are disconnected from what happens in the church.

Been a while since we ate at Nihon-Kai, so we gave it a try for lunch on New Year's day. Got there at 1:30 PM and it was still crowded. Had to sit at the bar counter. Interesting to experience the Japanese way of celebrating the new year. Right at the cashier counter, they had a plastic kagami mochi, which translates to mirror rice cake. Basically a snowman made of rice cake with a bitter orange on top. Not too sure about the traditional symbolism though. Since they had a special set for the day, we ordered it. Perfect for sharing with a little bit of everything-- tempura moriawase, grilled Saba, tamago, maki, inari, arrowroot chips (a Chinese touch), and ozoni which is a special mochi soup that is prepared during the new year. Also added on some nigiri sushi to complete the meal.

In the afternoon, I played Mr. Plumber. Tried to fix mum's leaky toilet. That attempt really taught me a thing or two about the 'anatomy' of a toilet. LOL. Managed to fix the leak, but I had to run out to the hardware store to get the right spare parts. Unfortunately, I discovered a more sinister problem with the plumbing. Something was definitely screwing up the pressure in my mum's bathroom. Probably some pesky leak. That's a job best left to the professionals.

At night, we had a BEC gathering at KM1 West. Everyone had a fun time trying to get to the multi-purpose hall due to the security measures. Visitors with no access cards could not access the lift lobbies and it was raining heavily outside. The problem with all these 6-tier security condominiums. A hell when you have a lot of guests coming over. At the venue, we were experiencing blackouts because the power was overloaded. Goodness. When we got all of that ironed out, we started the festivities. Stress levels were a little high because both parish priests came for the party. Luckily for us, they didn't stay long. Plenty of food and games. The hostess looked very happy because her husband joined in for the first time ever. Perhaps he wanted to cheer his wife up, who was diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year. A simple gesture but brings deep joy.

On the last day of the Christmas long weekend, I finally managed to spend some time with KH. Normally, Gratitude would cook Christmas dinner, but fears of water disruption, and a lack of a maid to do the clean up made him change his mind. Instead, he invited us for a dim sum brunch at Mayflower Restaurant, Le Garden Hotel (not to be confused with KK Mayflower nearby). It was a nice reunion with KH, Gratitude's mum, my mum, Apollo and QueerRanter-D. The dim sum was pretty good, with a larger portion. They had all the standard varieties, but KH was disappointed that they didn't have custard buns. I liked their siew mai and egg tarts.

For coffee, we moved to Brew and Bread. Now, they operate upstairs with the kitchen located in a nearby lot. Compared to last time, this arrangement gives them a whole lot more space to play with. With windows along the whole length of the back, the whole place is spilling with natural light. However, their furniture arrangement is a bit unconventional. A big round tables are quite out of place in a cafe. Why would people want to sit around it especially when there's a huge centerpiece in the middle. Then there's the super long table at the back. Reminded me of the school canteen. In terms of coffee, they now have two blends to choose from-- Driver and Sugar Daddy. Can't imagine why they chose those names. If you're into cold brew, they have something called a Bombshell that actually tastes like its spiked with alcohol. Their croissant is pretty good too, buttery and flaky.

Before leaving Kota Kemuning, we stopped a while at AEON Big but that turned out to be a big disappointment. Not well-stocked at all. Walked into a Nagoya as well, a place which brought back memories of my childhood. When I was a kid, mum regularly brought me to fabric shops. As a seamstress, she sometimes had to source for fabrics. While she was choosing, I would be exploring the 'forest' of cloth rolls, running my hands over the cold, silky material. Sometimes, I would scrutinize the price tags attached to the cloth rolls with safety pins. They were usually stamped in blue ink with a small sample of the cloth taped to the tag.

Later in the evening, KH and I had a dinner date with QueerRanter (the real deal!), Jin, Apollo, and QueerRanter-D. KH had no luck choosing the dinner venue in Publika.

Plan A - Episode. Not open.

Plan B - Silver Spoon. Not open.

Plan C - Two Sons Bistro. A random choice based on what was open. Halal.

Two Sons is a place famous for its mussels and clams. Sixteen varieties to choose from. We ordered a full size (900 grams) of lemon garlic butter mussels to share. Delicious with two portions of garlic bread to lap up the gravy. KH and I shared a Supreme Stuffed Chicken. Stuffed with what you may ask? Jalapeno peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, and cream cheese. Spicy and creamy at the same time. Not a very good feeling.

Dessert and coffee was really at Plan B. We reminisced about the days of drama in the heyday of the BFF. So much nonsense from nonsense people. ""My birthday party is better than your's"" nonsense. ""I'm manipulating your feelings"" nonsense. ""It's all about me"" nonsense. ""I'm a hypocrite who talks shit"" nonsense. The list goes on. But without them, it would have been a bland existence with nothing to reminisce about. Haha.

I did not wake up bright and early on Christmas morning. Just as I hit the send button on What's App asking my sister whether the kids had woken up, I heard a commotion downstairs. No mistaking it-- it was The Tribe. My sister had moved all the presents to my place. And it was a lot of presents. Combined with presents from SK and I, it was truly a formidable heap! The excitement and anticipation from the kids was palpable. However, they had to wait a little while longer. All of us donned our customized Christmas T-shirts and took a group photo first. Before we began, I brought out a laundry basket to contain all the discarded gift wrapping. The kids went through their presents like locusts. They got toys, shoes, clothes, bags, and water tumblers. Guess they were on Santa's Good list else they would have received white envelopes filled with cash from Sump'n Claus.

Never actually played with Lego Technic before, so it was nice of KH to get me a set. Once we cleared all the debris, it was time to go out for breakfast. BIL wanted to go to a cafe that was Christmas-y. Unfortunately, most of the cafes in Sri Petaling only opened at 11:00 AM. In the end, our stomachs decided that we eat at Poppo Kanteen, a cafe famed for its nasi lemak. If you're not into that, they have noodles and bread too. Plenty of variety and value for money. A suprising MYR8.90 for a big plate with a whole fried chicken leg. Their sambal is pretty good, but the rice didn't quite make the cut.

Right on their doorstep is another nasi lemak stall. That stall has been around for years and the rice is really good. Very savoury and creamy. Much better than Poppo Kanteen, but their sambal falls short. What we did was combine the best of both worlds. Haha. The staff didn't mind. Another thing I liked about Poppo Kanteen was the cham. Great taste and hot! Don't ever give me that lukewarm shit. A drink that makes you go ""Ahhhhhh...."" after every sip. Big Monster had a very good appetite. He walloped a plate of nasi lemak, roti Planta, and potato wedges!

In the afternoon, we made a visit to Sunway Velocity Mall, one of KL's newest retail spots. Boy, what a mistake that was. The roads were choked and the mall was overflowing with people. Been a long time since I saw such good business at a mall. The escalators were packed and groups of people were seen just standing around. Crazy. Every ten minutes, there would be a public paging for lost kids and disoriented adults. But this took the cake:

""Dear shoppers, please be advised that there is a traffic jam on Jalan Cheras and Jalan Peel. We advise you to continue shopping. Thank you.""

The Tribe watched ""Moana"" there at 4:00 PM, but mum and I had some time to kill before our movie. We did some shopping and had a late lunch / early dinner at Canton Kitchen. Not recommended at all. Lethargic service and lousy portions. They charge prices similar to Foong Lye for their set meals but what you get is a far cry. Lukewarm food with just a whole lot of Chinese cabbage in different forms. The only thing I liked was the Pumpkin Springroll.

With an hour to go before our movie at Leisure Mall, I fired up the Uber app. Got a ride on a brand new HRV. The driver remarked that traffic was fine before the opening of the mall. Oh well. The ride to Leisure Mall took less than fifteen minutes. Believe it or not, it was my first time at this iconic Cheras mall. Looks pretty good for a neighbourhood mall. Pretty impressive Christmas decorations. Gave me some Singapore heartland mall vibes.

We watched ""Show Me Your Love"", a local production with a cast fortified by Hong Kong actors. I expected more tears from the movie, but it fell a bit short. Overall a nice movie with funny and touching moments. The cinema hall was also surprisingly comfortable. Perhaps they had changed the seats in recent years. Got out of the cinema just in time for The Tribe to pick us up. Truly a fun Christmas spent with loved ones.

Thursday, February 09, 2017

Unexpectedly, my sister turned up at our doorstep on the morning of Christmas eve. Naturally, the kids were thrilled to see her. We had a day out in Bukit Bintang ahead of us. First stop was Pavilion Kuala Lumpur to look at the Christmas decorations. Like past years, there was a huge tree out front. The only difference was that they had a train that traveled around the tree. In my opinion, its quite a nuisance to have that when so many people mill at the entrance. Swarovski returned as the main sponsors for the center atrium's Christmas decorations, but I wasn't very impressed by it. This time round, the center atrium is dominated by a castle and a crystal carousel. In the overall theme, it's not very attention-grabbing. Mum shopped while I kept the kids in check. The typical running around, and crawling in and out of clothes racks. Difficult to shop in peace with kids around. All that running around helped the kids build up an appetite. By noon, they were asking for food.

At first, we thought of eating at D'Empire, but after looking at how limited the menu was, we walked out. Instead, we ate at Pigs and Wolf located on the Dining Loft. Much better options there. The Christmas set looked like a steal, so we ordered that. MYR60 bought us a soup, main, dessert, and ice lemon tea. They served a cream of potato soup that came with a side of bacon. Both kids gave a squeal of joy when they saw the bacon. For the main, we chose the Prawn and Salmon Pesto that came with generous portion of smoked salmon, and juicy prawns. Dessert was a slice of moist chocolate roll. In addition to that, we got a plate of Carbonara with pork sausages for Little Monster. Big Monster practically polished off a Mighty Piggy Burger all by himself. He loved the thick, juicy patty made from US pork. Since he ordered a burger, his uncle could get a pint of Asahi for MYR10.

Their neighbours, Starz Kitchen and Rocku Yakiniku both had Santa Claus out front to attract customers and spread some Christmas cheer. But not all Santa Claus are created equal. Starz Kitchen obviously had the bigger budget. They actually got a fat gweilo to play the part. The wig, beard, and costume was also much better. The guy from Rocku Yakiniku was Cina-fied version in an ill-fitting SuperSave costume.

Last stop for the day was Isetan the Japan Store. Had to be very careful in there. Porcelain art with a price tag of MYR14,000 located at child level? OK, shoooh, we are going to the other floors. Didn't stay long really. The kids were tired and Big Monster even started sneezing from all the air-conditioning.

Mum and I attended Christmas Eve mass at church that night. There was the usual caroling before mass. During the procession, Baby Jesus was held aloft by the priest and subsequently placed into the manger, and incensed. Everyone was all dressed up and parishioners exchanged greetings to mark the happy occasion of Jesus' birth.

Monday, February 06, 2017

In order to make it to English mass at SIC, we had to get up at 7:00 AM. After getting ready, one still needs to fuss over the sleepy kids. At church, we bundled them into the soundproof family room and hoped that they would not be too rowdy. Big Monster asked me a legit question:Big Monster: Is Jesus dead?Moi: Yes, but he resurrected after three days.Big Monster: Oh, someone threw him a Potion of Regeneration.

In case you were wondering, he was talking about something from Minecraft! Obsessed with that game, they are. We ate breakfast at Mian then headed home. Mum needed to prepare for her event in the afternoon. She boiled the tang yuan and packed loads of pots and ladles. There was even a portable stove in the heap of stuff. Sent her out to Happy Garden where she would carpool to Brickfields with her friends.

It's daunting to handle the two monsters alone so I employed the help of KH. Picked him up and went for a late lunch at Secret Loc Cafe, Kuchai Lama. Although it was already 3:00 PM, all of use weren't starving. Chose kid-friendly items from the menu-- American breakfast, French toast, and pizza. The little one was shouting his head off in the cafe. Buat macam rumah sendiri. When the little ones saw me feeding KH, they exclaimed:

""Uncle KH is not a kid!""

Went home soon after. Switched on the Google Chromecast for the kids then we stole off to my room for some snogging. In the heat of the moment, there would suddenly be a knock on the door:

""Kau fu! I wanna watch a different YouTube clip!""

Talk about coitus interruptus. In the end we just gave up and went downstairs to watch ""Assassination Classroom: The Graduation"" with the kids. The weird story line and even weirder main character, Korosensei resonated with my nephews.

SK joined us for dinner at Restoran Mirasa, a mamak joint near my place. Big Monster finished a Maggi goreng all by himself while the little one only concentrated on the cup of Milo. The idea of waffles was tantalizing to the kids, so we had dessert at The New Chapter. Loitered there as long as we could, but the night was still young, and mum's event was far from over. Decided to send KH home first. On our way back home, received a call from mum. Aha! Duty would be over soon. :P.

who i am ?

I've been told that I look like Suneo Honekawa (how I wish it was Takuya Kimura). I'm fickle (so typical of Librans and other member's of the Alternate society). I laugh and grin a lot (must be some Cheshire Cat genes in there some where too). I have a loving family. Plenty of friends (SK's the best!). And a single person who completes me-- my dear KH. Life has been all ups and downs. But I'm a Thurday's child, so I guess there 's still far to go.

A NASA study finds the amount of ozone destroyed in the Arctic in 2011, shown in this image, was comparable to the ozone 'hole' that formed each spring since the mid-1980s [EPA]

In 1974, chemists Mario Molina and Frank Sherwood Rowland published a landmark article that demonstrated the ability of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to break down the ozone layer, the atmospheric region that plays a vital role in shielding humans and other life from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It marked the opening salvo of a decade-long fight to phase out and ban the use of these widespread industrial compounds. The period between Molina and Rowland's article and the establishment of an international agreement to regulate CFCs was remarkably similar to current climate change politics. It included calls for scientific consensus before moving on the issue, industry push back, fears over economic chaos, claims of inadequate chemical substitutes, difficulty in getting industrialised nations to the table, and debates and diplomacy over how to get developing nations to agree to regulate a problem predominantly caused by the industrialised world. Together, these issues created a political climate that was anything but conducive to an agreement for avoiding environmental catastrophe.

And yet an agreement was reached. CFC production was greatly curtailed and disaster was averted. The Montreal Protocol - initially signed by 24 nations in 1987 and now ratified by 196 countries - bound nations to a set of policies that would rapidly reduce the use of CFCs. It became the first global environmental treaty to implement the precautionary approach, mandating strong actions now to avert future damage. The protocol has since become, in the words of former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, ""perhaps the single most successful international environmental agreement."" It can also be called the first climate change treaty, since ozone-depleting substances are potent greenhouse gases. Lessons from the fight and eventual ban of CFCs can illuminate our current struggles to regulate greenhouse gases and provide guidance toward creating a strong treaty necessary to stave off another environmental disaster.

An $8bn industry

For more than 40 years, the generally non-toxic and non-flammable compounds known as CFCs were widely produced and used in refrigerants, propellants, and solvents. They were first manufactured as a safe alternative to ammonia and sulphur dioxide in refrigeration in the early 1930s. Their widespread success, due to their unique and seemingly miraculous chemical properties, propelled an $8bn industry that employed 600,000 people directly and was reaching new heights of manufacturing at the time of Molina and Rowland's discovery. As CFC production swelled to meet the global demand for aerosol and refrigeration, so too did the release of these ozone-depleting compounds into the atmosphere.

Unlike carbon dioxide, CFCs are a foreign element in the atmosphere. When released, CFC molecules rise and reach the ozone layer where they encounter UV radiation. The strong radiation breaks down these molecules into their simpler parts, most notably chlorine atoms. Molina and Rowland realised these now free chlorine atoms could react and deplete the ozone layer. The US Environmental Protection Agency estimates that one chlorine atom can destroy 100,000 ozone molecules. Continuing to produce CFCs at such high levels would inevitably have depleted more of the ozone layer and would have led to greater harm to humans from UV rays. Further studies concurred with Molina and Rowland's findings and predicted losses of ozone that would have greatly increased cases of skin cancer and eye damage. Other detrimental impacts included reduced productivity in plants and crops and harm to marine life and air quality.

The findings provoked wide-ranging reactions. Emboldened by the passage of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts in the United States, the science and environmental communities wanted the US government to ban production and use of CFCs. They saw the depletion of the ozone layer as a grave, imminent threat that needed to be met with decisive action. The CFC industry, led by DuPont, which accounted for nearly 50 per cent of the market, attacked the theory as unfounded, arguing that no stratospheric ozone loss had been observed. DuPont and other CFC manufacturers lobbied extensively to prevent states from passing bills banning CFC use.

The 'ban-now-find-out-later' approach

DuPont also embarked on an advertising campaign to undermine the idea that CFCs damaged the ozone layer, while simultaneously arguing that any hasty restrictions would have a disastrous impact on businesses, jobs and the economy. DuPont's chairman, Irving Shapiro, announced to several major newspapers that ""the 'ban-now-find-out-later' approach thrust upon an $8bn segment of industry, both in the headlines and in many legislative proposals, is a disturbing trend. Businesses can be destroyed before scientific facts are assembled and evaluated … The nation cannot afford to act on this and other issues before the full facts are known.""

Public health concerns, however, trumped industry arguments and consumers began boycotting aerosol sprays. Pressure from environmentalists and consumer groups resulted in a ban on aerosol sprays in 1978. In the end, though, the ban turned out to be only a partial victory for both sides. Nearly all sprays were banned, but numerous putatively ""essential"" uses of CFCs in air conditioners and refrigerators remained unregulated.

The United States was the only major CFC-producing nation to voluntarily eliminate CFCs in aerosols, although relatively minor producers such as Canada, Denmark and Sweden soon followed suit. And while European nations today are at the forefront of promoting climate change legislation, in the 1970s and 1980s, CFC-producing giants like England and France were reluctant to impose restrictions.

After these initial efforts by individual nations, progress toward an international CFCs agreement ground to a halt in the early 1980s. This was largely because protecting the ozone layer produced an unprecedented problem for human society. The public and governments were being told that the impacts of a thinning ozone layer would not be seen for decades. Yet in order to prevent much higher risks of skin cancer and cataracts, it was essential to act now and begin phasing out CFCs. Manufacturers continued to resist, arguing that in the absence of suitable substitutes, curtailing CFC production would result in significant job losses and a large reduction in the supply of air conditioners and refrigerators. They argued that action on CFCs would harm both the developed and developing world. On top of this, almost all nations would have to agree on a coordinated phase out and eventual ban of the industrial compounds since the release of CFCs by any one nation would have a global impact.

Delayed implementations

Producers of CFCs continued to wage a public battle against further regulation. Sceptics stepped up their public relations campaigns disputing the evidence, finding scientists to argue persuasively against the threat, and predicting dire economic consequences. The doubt did nothing to change the scientific consensus around CFCs and ozone depletion, but it helped to delay implementation of limits on CFCs for many years.

While special interests were fighting it out in the public square, diplomacy was taking place behind the scenes. Domestic and international workshops were assessing the CFC-ozone connection while proposing various regulations, compromises, and deals to get major CFC-producing nations and developing nations to the table to begin talks toward an international agreement. The United States and the UN Environment Programme played leading roles. The fruit of this diplomatic labour was the Vienna Convention of March 1985, which produced a framework agreement in which states agreed to cooperate in research and assessments of the ozone problem, to exchange information and to adopt measures to prevent harm to the ozone layer. But the accord fell far short of mandating actions to limit CFC production or of establishing a timetable to phase it out. Much like the current climate change debate, it looked as if action on the issue was about to be stymied by a lengthy political struggle.

Two months later, scientists discovered the Antarctic ozone hole. From a climate change perspective, this would be comparable to a large ice sheet breaking off from an ice shelf, melting overnight and causing a small rise in sea level, thereby warning the world of the potential consequences of unchecked climate change. Scientists discovered that ozone levels over the Antarctic had dropped by 10 per cent during the winter and an ozone hole had begun to form. The ozone hole is an area with extremely low amounts of ozone, not an actual hole. But the discovery, the first startling proof of the thinning ozone layer, was an alarming wake-up call that human activities can have dire consequences for the atmosphere and in turn major health implications. Intense media attention galvanised public opinion and sparked fears that ozone holes might form over populated cities around the world. The EPA estimated that if CFC production continued to grow at 2.5 per cent a year until 2050, 150 million Americans would develop skin cancer, leading to some 3 million deaths by 2075.

After the momentous discovery of ozone depletion, the balance shifted toward regulation. Industry at first still lobbied in private, but eventually began to change its position as scientific evidence of ozone depletion continued to mount. In the summer of 1987, as preparations were under way for the Montreal Conference on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the Reagan administration publicly came out in support of international limits on CFC production. This effectively put a stop to industry opposition and propelled an agreement among industrialised nations to reduce CFC production by 50 per cent by 2000. The resulting Montreal Protocol included a 10-year grace period and a fund for developing nations in order to get them to agree to regulate a problem largely generated by the industrialised world. The Multilateral Fund has since provided $2.7bn to developing nations for transitioning to better technology and CFC substitutes and for meeting phase-out obligations. The fund was the first financial instrument of its kind and is the model for the UN-REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) programme, in which industrial nations use carbon offsets to provide developing nations with an incentive for conserving their forests.

The Montreal Protocol

Since 1987, the Montreal Protocol has been strengthened with the addition of more ozone-damaging substances to the list and the compliance of nearly 200 countries. Ozone-depleting substances in the atmosphere hit their peak in 1997–98 and have been falling ever since. Action on account of the ozone layer has greatly improved air quality while reducing the future risk of skin cancer, cataracts, and blindness. Furthermore, the treaty has done more than any other to reduce climate change by stopping 135bn metric tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions from escaping to the atmosphere in the last two decades. Due to the nature of CFCs, however, the ozone is still thinning in certain places. This may well continue until the middle of the 21st century, at which point the ozone layer should begin to recover.

The true significance of the international agreement is best illustrated by a NASA simulation of what would have occurred had CFC production continued at its pre-Montreal rate. By 2020, 17 per cent of global ozone would be destroyed. By 2040, the ozone thinning would affect the entire planet. And by 2065, atmospheric ozone drops to 70 per cent below 1970s levels. As a result, there would have been a threefold increase in the amount of harmful UV radiation reaching the planet's surface, resulting in tens of millions of skin cancer and cataract cases and trillions in health care costs. Luckily, it is a fate we managed to avoid.

The first and foremost lesson to take from the fight to ban CFCs is that it was successful. The discovery that human activity was harming the atmosphere influenced public opinion and consumer buying power enough to change national policy and provide momentum toward an international agreement that enacted regulations to prevent a future catastrophe. Nations agreed to take precautions that would cause some short-term difficulties in order to head off a long-term disaster.

Secondly, health concerns were the driving motivator behind public and government action. Peter Morrisette argues that the passage of a meaningful ozone treaty relied on four key factors: Ozone depletion was viewed as a global problem; there was strong scientific understanding of the causes and effects of ozone depletion; there were public-health concerns about skin cancer, which were amplified by the ozone hole discovery; and substitutes for CFCs were available. Climate change is also viewed as a global problem and there is a nearly universal consensus among climate scientists over the causes. Some argue that the major difference between obtaining a treaty back then and what hinders today's agreement is a lack of readily available substitutes in the form of alternative energy - wind, solar, electric - to take the place of fossil fuels.

International agreement

Yet the claim that no cost-effective, efficient substitutes were available was also made during the CFC debates. It was not until after the ozone hole discovery, at which point an international agreement seemed likely, that industry announced that substitutes could be made available under the right market conditions and policy incentives. CFC producers used the ensuing protocol as a mechanism to develop and market substitutes. Might not a similar situation unfold today if governments enforced greenhouse gas reductions, and policy and market conditions fostered alternative energies?

It seems the major difference between a successful ozone treaty and an out-of-reach climate agreement is the weak connection made between climate change and human health. Where ozone depletion was primarily thought of as a human health issue, climate change is an environmental issue. Until that narrative is altered, an agreement on climate change could be elusive.

Encouraging signs toward that end are emerging, none more so than the US EPA declaration that greenhouse gases jeopardise public health. The declaration paves way for the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants and other facilities. The regulatory route seems the most feasible way to reduce greenhouse emissions in the United States, as any climate change legislation has been killed in Congress. The Supreme Court ruling in favour of the EPA gave the agency judicial approval to use its authority to regulate such gases under the Clean Air Act. Just as measures to protect the ozone layer have benefited the climate, so too will EPA action on regulating greenhouse gases provide important health benefits by cleaning up the air.

Added benefits of climate mitigation

It is important to communicate that climate change mitigation will have the added benefit of reducing air pollution and improving respiratory health. It will also reduce the use of fossil fuels like oil and coal whose extraction processes - from mountaintop removal, which clogs streams and pollutes water supplies, to offshore drilling spills, which can contaminate seafood - have direct human health implications.

While regulation at the national level is a good start, an international agreement - perhaps a stronger version of the Kyoto Protocol - will be necessary to achieve global cooperation on climate change. For this to happen, the public will need to voice greater concern and take more action, as it did during the CFC threat. Ozone depletion was framed as an international human health issue, which amplified the public's demand for accelerated government action. A similar approach may work for climate change. The question that remains is whether a catastrophic discovery similar to the ozone hole will be necessary to spur global concerns over climate change and push governments to act. If so, the consequences may prove to be far more disruptive - economically and ecologically - than the ozone problem of the previous century.

"New Garden Website Design

Woodside Garden is a walled garden near Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. It has a plant centre, an award winning coffee shop and runs a series of events throughout the year. We were delighted when we secured the Woodside Garden website design contract.

Stephen and Emma Emmerson inherited their website when they bought the business back in 2010. Over the years they had “made do” with it, but it no longer met their needs: it was not mobile-friendly and it was difficult to add events and highlight blogs on the front page. There has also been a recent re-brand and the existing site could not be updated easily to incorporate the new logo and colour scheme.

Emma was confident that Red Kite Services could deliver a website that she wanted as we have a good knowledge of plants and wildlife. We have also worked on updating the website for Stillingfleet Lodge Gardens for many years, showing further experience in the sector.

Website Review

We started the re-build process by reviewing the existing site and agreeing the content and images that would be retained. We streamlined the number of pages and reviewed the categories on the site.

We set up a development site where we could design the outline using our favourite template. We used the new colours from the logo throughout the site and used categories to place appropriate blogs onto the static pages. Emma did not want us to use sliders, but did send us some stunning images to use. She wanted a nice clean site but with a flowery touch, which we achieved by adding curved frames to the images.

Events

She also wanted to easily add events, so we used a simple plug in. This makes it easy to add events and the next few events are highlighted in the sidebar. We have also categorised events so that if you look on the Wee Woodsiders page you can see a full list of child-friendly events.

We are still in the free “snagging” stage which we offer on all our website builds, so we are still working with Emma to develop the site now it has gone live.

New Wellesley Business Wants To Teach The World To Sew!

Lauren Johnston is doing her part to ensure sewing doesn’t become a lost art.

Sew Easy, a business she started 15 years ago in Needham to teach kids and teens how to sew, expanded this summer into a second floor space in Wellesley at 159 Linden St. 3C.

Sew easy, which begins its next 8-week session in Wellesley on Sept. 17, has taught more than 9,000 girls and boys to sew over the years. Students range in age from 5.5 to about 16, and classes are held after school and on Saturdays. Sew Easy charges about $325 per session, which includes materials. The Wellesley location has 12 sewing machines.

“I want to teach the world to sew,” says Johnston, whose programs mainly involve using sewing machines, though also include hand sewing. She says that she thinks sewing is coming back, even though most kids’ parents don’t sew and even though sewing classes are rare in school these days. “They’ve seen grandparents sewing,” she says.

At Sew Easy, kids learn how to sew buttonholes, zippers, pockets and hems as well as how to thread the sewing machines. They get to use a variety of fabrics, including cotton and fleece. Students complete between 5 and 10 projects per session, creating clothes, bags and even American Doll outfits.

While Sew Easy’s two locations are just a few miles far apart, Johnston says she appreciates that the closer the better for parents shuttling their children from activity to activity after school. She said parents of kids who have taken classes at the Needham spot have been begging her to open a place in Wellesley.

It would be a stretch to call Wellesley the sewing capital of the world, but there is maybe more needle-and-thread action around here than you might think. For example, there’s the Button Box shop on Rte. 9 that caters to quilters, the Wellesley Needlepoint Collection on Grove Street, and local artist Abby Glassenberg has made a name for herself via the soft sculptures she sews.

Classes start at 3:15 p.m., but children’s noses press up against the glass of the Needham storefront long before the door is unlocked. Here, six days a week, the nearly lost art of sewing is revered and creativity is unleashed.

Enriching Fabric of Their Lives

Lauren Johnston says she has taught over 8,000 students since launching Sew Easy 13 years ago. Last week she opened a second branch in West Roxbury, where she hopes to further disseminate an old-fashioned skill that is still indispensable in this high-tech age.

“In an instant, children feel empowered,” said Johnston, whose students, male and female, range in age from elementary through high school. “They choose the project that they want to work on and the fabrics that they want to use, and are excited and proud about expressing their creativity.”

Johnston has over 300 projects for her students to choose from – book bags, fleece vests, ponchos, mittens, quilts, American Girl Doll accessories, pajama pants. Some use their time to alter clothing, and during the holiday season they tend to make gifts.

Each time someone finishes a project, they ring a large bell and the class goes silent in order to see what has been completed and give the student a round of applause. Johnston then encourages them to place their project in the storefront window “to show the world what they’ve made.”

Some projects are basic, like small decorative pillows, and others are more elaborate. One girl, she said, walked in with a sketch of a lobster costume and made it for Halloween.

An eight-week session of one class a week costs $299, which includes all materials. On average, classes are capped at 18 students. With 15 sewing machines, no one has to wait to use one, since not every student needs a machine all the time. “They help each other out and really feel like they’re a part of this place,” she said.

Johnston said parents often tell her that their child is creating things using tape and staples to hold the fabric together. Those kids, she said, are really ready to learn. But it’s not just the creative and technical aspects of teaching that bring Johnston satisfaction, it’s also observing the emotional growth of her students.

“There is no gossip allowed in here,” said Johnston. “I tell the kids ‘I’d rather hear about you.’ ” Sometimes during a snack break, she will throw out questions for discussion, such as “What is something positive that we would never guess about you?” or “What are some experiences that you would like to have but aren’t yet old enough?”

And on occasion she will read aloud an inspirational thought for the day.

“They laugh, but then they quiet down and listen,” said Johnston, who hopes that insightful, introspective words will encourage self-awareness and confidence.

Sew Easy opens new location in Wellesley

Lauren Johnston, owner and founder of Sew Easy, has been teaching children how to sew since 1995. She said she’s taught the “dying art” to more than 9,000 kids and teens in the past 15 years.

Johnston recently expanded her operation to Wellesley. The Townsman caught up with Johnston at the new location, 159 Linden St., to ask her about her business and why so many children still want to learn to sew.

“I always loved sewing,” Johnston said. “So my children always wanted to get at the machine. I saw that it was easy to teach them and then their friends started joining and the masses came.”

What prompted your expansion to Wellesley?

“Wellesley wanted us to come and so I said, ‘Why not?’” Johnston said. “Wellesley asked us over and over to come here.”

Why do you think kids and teens want to sew when they could just buy everything they needed?

“It’s not about being able to buy it,” Johnston said. “When you create something you feel empowered. Most of the last generation doesn’t know how to sew so kids feel empowered because their parents don’t know how to sew.”

What kind of items do the students sew?

“We have over 300 projects,” Johnston said. She said that students make everything from clothing to American Girl Doll accessories and even, sometimes, dog clothing.

Do any boys come to these classes?

“I usually have one or two in a class,” she said. Classes range in size from 12 to 20.

Where did you learn to sew?

“[I learned from] my grandma and Home Ec in junior high.”

Is that where the passion began?

“Yes, it felt so good to complete a project from scratch and I couldn’t believe I made it myself. The stuff I made when I was young was so elaborate,” Johnston said. “I really loved it.”

What would you say to a kid who said sewing is boring?

“I’ve never heard that once from the 9,000 kids I’ve taught,” Johnston said. “So I don’t think I have to answer that.”

“It’s word of mouth,” she added. “It’s the kids that do all the advertising. I’m always full despite the bad economy.”

How do you stay current?

“We know what kids like,” Johnston said. “After 15 years and 9,000 kids, we know. I have to buy fabric with peace signs, turtles, polka dots and monkeys.”

What do you love about teaching?

‘I love to teach,” Johnston said, “and the some of the kids come in nervous, but within an hour and a half they don’t want to leave.

“I love to see the shift in kids to when they start feeling empowered. I get to witness the shift from knowing nothing to feeling like they know a lot in a short amount of time – it’s instant.

“I ask them, ‘do you feel like a good sewer?’ and they say ‘yes.’”

“Our mission is to instill confidence and creativity. And we feel every child needs to feel success. We want them to walk away with that feeling and completing a project makes them feel that way.”

Johnston said it’s her particular system that helps her students find this success.

“The system is the reason why we are successful,” Johnston said. “It allows kids to create quicker. The way we design our things more streamlined. The detail is not like yesteryears.”

“The kids that come in with learning disabilities,” Johnston said, “in 99 percent of them I don’t find what they’ve been diagnosed with here. And I’m looking for it, but I never find it. They just take it in and grasp it.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Too many people are oblivious to the daily injustices that our systems enforce against our own fellow citizens within the city of San Diego and otherwise. Today, you shed light on the criminal justice system’s flaws and our cultural shortcomings. These systems are perpetuated by, as most things unjust, money changing hands. To get at the root of institutionalized injustice, which already impairs marginalized communities disproportionately, consider investigating the impact of the two, publicly-traded private prison companies who hold contracts with the State of California. The State’s contracts directly impact justice and the lack thereof in San Diego. Specifically, question the lobbying they do with respect to rules around detainment, arrests, convictions and lengths of prison sentences. These two companies and the handful of financial institutions with large holdings in them have assets in multibillions that depend on consistent - or ideally rapid - growth in the number of people in jail.

how many people attended the rallies? Particularly the one on Saturday. Where was it? apparently the NAACP paid for it. Who was the keynote speaker? Where was it on the news on Saturday night or Sunday morning or even Sunday night?

How does the Hispanic community feel about the vilification of Zimmerman? Since the courts found him innocent and the NAACP convicted him yet never referred to him as a Hispanic does this show bias on their part?

He would have been better to say, ""Due to the Stand Your Ground law in Florida, what happened to Martin could have happened to any one of us.""

I didn't vote for Obama because he's black. I voted for him because I thought he'd do a better job than McCain and Romney. I still do. But for the first time I feel like he's telling us he's not the American president, but a black man.

Still, I understand where he's coming from. I'm a minority, too. But oddly the racist comments I've received in my life have been directed at me by black people, not white. Although some whites have, they were mostly black. And the prejudiced comments directed toward me have been from Mexicans who don't believe I'm Mexican enough. They accuse me of being ashamed of being a Mexican because I'm different than the stereotype.

I think the president would have been better to keep out of this. The law is the law and will remain so until changed.

Obama aside, I don't think the Martin/Zimmerman verdict will have a lasting impact on race relations in San Diego. Mexican-Americans and Asians are always excluded from ""conversations about race."" From this corner of the country, ""race relations"" on the national level comes down to Black or White. That's what the media peddles and the public buys.

I agree wholeheartedly with the speakers about the need for greater understanding, so that people of color can experience life without constantly being disrespected. A Black man should be able to ride an elevator with a White woman without being perceived as a threat! This harkens back to the racism that eventually took the life of Emmet Till.

The point about power and the desire to maintain it is so true. Power in this society is still held by a wealthy White majority, and until White privilege stops driving violence like it did that night in Florida -- even though Zimmerman is not ethnically White, he displays as White, and was subjected all his life to the lure of Euro-centrism -- and like it did when the jury decided to acquit him, we will rally, march, and yes PROTEST.

Barbarism and bigotry begin in the home. Younger generations inherited their bigotry from their parents and grandparents. They'll pass those values on to their children. Enlightenment breaks the chain.

Weil asks good questions. Where were they held. Why were they not more widely announced? This is the problem with many of the pro-immigrant rallies. By the time I hear about them, it's too late! Or, they have it in from of the County building at 4pm on a Friday!!!

It's impacted the country badly with very different narratives about the event being a function of race. I have seen little that would seem to lead toward harmonizing those disparate viewpoints. I don't know why it would be different in San Diego.

Barack Obama speaks on behalf of many special interests each and every day. He made the statement as a result of being under intense pressure from 13% of the population. No one has a problem with the innumberable statements he's made on behalf of other special interest groups, domestic or foreign.

""It's impacted the country badly with very different narratives about the event being a function of race. I have seen little that would seem to lead toward harmonizing those disparate viewpoints. I don't know why it would be different in San Diego.""

San Diego's African-American population is 6% (in the City with a lower percentage in the County). Looking at the disparities on this comment board, those numbers hold up. Getting a balanced reaction to the verdict in San Diego is statistically impossible. That's why this conversation has to be opened-up to Americans of all ethnic descents. That won't be possible until ""racism"" is no longer framed solely as Black or White.

""he displays as White"". Is this new liberal speak? I have never heard this term before and wonder what kind of mind came up with this. Sad commentary on ""civil"" society. Racial and ethnic division and separation seems to be the focus instead of racial and ethnic harmony.

DLR is correct, we know how the Korean immigrants viewed African Americans in L.A. Any race or ethnicity can be a bigot or discriminatory toward another. We also know how a lot of people today view Arab-Americans. I remember one time, I was at a gas station downtown. A black man was saying something outloud. I wasn't paying attention. He then drew closer to me and repeated his question. I replied, ""Sorry, I didn't realize you were speaking to me."" He had an accent which in my educated guess, I would say he was Somali. Anyway, he then said ""Oh, I thought you were being racist"" or words to that effect. It was obvious to me that he had had some unpleasant encounter.

As for Zimmerman, he is Latino on his mother's side (it usually on the mother's side), but even as a Latino, he can still be classified for statistical purposes as the governemnt puts it, as ""white.""

Duckster, then ""stand your ground laws"" are a legal/judicial issue--not a racial one--and should be reconsidered. Take those laws to court.

This whole incident has shown that America seems to prefer segregation (by all sides) rather than inclusion. Perhaps the past is our future, too.

Mission,

Why would the government classify Zimmerman as white? I would assume it would be Hispanic. Just like Obama is black and would never be considered white. Unless he committed a crime against a minority. Funny how that works.

IT IS A SICK SOCIETY which pretends that Trayvon Martin hasn't already received the justice that he deserved, a sick society which calls for George Zimmerman's head --- but then it is a sick, sick society which elects --- and then re-elects --- and re-elects --- scum like Barak Hushpuppy OhBummer, Biden The Magnificent, Nazi Pelosi, Filthy Harry Reid, and NYC Mayor Doomberg. In the best of all possible worlds, they'll all be on a plane which crashes into the NY Times Editorial offices at midmorning, any work day, next week.

The real assassins in the Martin-Zimmerman confrontation are 1] Martin, 2] Barak Hushpuppy OhBummer, who is trying to promote race riots and the assassination of George Zimmerman, 3] Attorney General Eric ""Fast and Furious"" Holder, who will make sure that Zimmerman is unarmed when OhBummer’s and Holder's proxy assassins come for him, and 4] the fascist Democrat-captured media who are character assassins operating on behalf of the Democrat party and the OhBummer dictatorship.

As well, these media propagandists are actionable as accessories before the fact if they succeed in promoting the injury or assassination of George Zimmerman. Every one of the media who have tried or who will try to cause injury to Zimmerman is a legitimate legal target of people who believe in justice --- the justice which Trayvon Martin earned when he jumped George Zimmerman and attempted to murder him. Two lying fascist sacks of shxt --- OhBummer and Holder --- and of course the usual race hustlers like Sharpton, Farrakhan, and Jackson --- can be counted on to promote racial hysteria and a false narrative on this subject, year-on-year, and decade-on-decade, ad nauseam, ad infinitum.

As for ""racism in America,"" there are millions more black racists than white racists in America today --- and the hundreds of millions of non-racists in America have ""nothing"" to apologize for --- no ""guilt"" to feel or adopt --- no ""white privilege"" to apologize for --- no “reparations” to pay --- no obligation to kowtow to all of the black racists --- or to Unkle Skum --- by which expression I mean “government at any and every level of American society.”

In his call to the police before the incident, Zimmerman was advised by the cops to stay in his vehicle. Critics say that Zimmerman had “a duty” to ""follow orders"" but the caution issued by the cops was not a lawful command, else he would have been cited by the cops, and he wasn't.

Even corrupt Florida State Attorney Angela Corey --- who hid evidence from the defense and fired the whistleblower who outed her --- did not argue that Zimmerman had a legal obligation to remain in his vehicle --- and he exited his vehicle when Martin disappeared from sight.

Zimmerman called the police before Martin jumped him --- and MSNBC deleted parts of the recorded discussion and broadcast it to make it look like Zimmerman was targeting Martin because Martin was black --- rather than tailing Martin because he was wandering around in the dark in a neighborhood which had recently suffered some break-ins and thwarted other break-ins.

This was MSNBC's attempt to lynch a straw horse, a so-called ""white"" Hispanic. MSNBC needed a black-white confrontation to promote their own racist, anti-white narrative that America is a ""racist"" society --- a society wherein whites should be disarmed --- and pay reparations to non-whites for the ""privilege"" [crime] of being white.

There is no evidence whatever that race played a part in Zimmerman's execution of his duties as the on-duty Neighborhood Watch Volunteer.

It is said with great derision that Zimmerman is or was ""a wannabe cop."" These critics appear to live in safe neighborhoods, no? There's nothing wrong with the aspiration to be a cop unless one intends to indict all cops for wanting to be cops --- and letting a puddy like Chris Matthews be the nighttime Neighborhood Watch volunteer strikes me as ineffective, to say the least --- although a pretty good way to get rid of Chris Matthews, come to think of it.

Immediately upon the breaking of this story in the media, there was the assumption that the confrontation between Martin and Zimmerman had something to do with Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. But because Martin jumped Zimmerman and knocked him to the ground and proceeded to beat him in ""mixed martial arts"" pound-and-ground style, Zimmerman clearly was not ""standing his ground"" --- in the moment of confrontation, he was on his back with Martin on top of him smashing his nose out of shape and smashing Zimmerman's head on the cement.

The attacks on “stand your ground” laws are being made by opportunists whose real objective is to leave the American citizen defenseless and let the freelance-Democrat scum rule the streets of America.

I say that the American people should be well-armed and well-ammoed and stand their ground against the OhBummer dictatorship and against Unkle Skum --- against American government at every level. We have no obligation whatever to surrender to fascist statism --- or to any other brand of statism, as a matter of fact. That government is best which governs least. It is said that American government rests upon the consent of the governed. Now is the time for all good men and women to withdraw and cancel that consent.

Trayvon Martin has been portrayed in the media as a sweetie-pie. The first published pictures of him that I saw were of Martin at the age of 12, or so, looking relatively mild and not especially bright.

The pictures which Martin published of himself at age 17, online, and before he attacked Zimmerman --- and pictures which others had of him at that age --- showed him at 160 lbs and six feet in height --- a football player who had had some ""mixed martial arts"" training, in his own website flipping-off the viewer, smoking marijuana, and holding a semiautomatic handgun --- I guess OhBummer would have to call that “an assault weapon,” ay? He'd twice been suspended from school, had been found in possession of stolen property, started fights with other people, was a dopehead, and gave the impression that he was also a dope dealer.

Trayvon Martin was a cheap thug, and it makes perfect sense for Barak Hushpuppy OhBummer to say that if he'd had a son, that his son would look like and be like Trayvon Martin, although, arguably, that son would look more like Trayvon Martin's ally, Rachel Jeantel, who has good reason to wear a hoodie, and probably also a very large trashbag, all things considered.

So let Barak Hushpuppy OhBummer and Eric ""Fast and Furious"" Holder don their hoodies --- their version of the racist KKK pointy-headed white sheets --- and let them pursue their black racist witch hunt and their campaign of character assassination against George Zimmerman.

I say that the majority of the American people see OhBummer and Holder --- and the Democrat-captured media --- and the whole OhBummer Wrecking Crew --- for what they truly are --- a dictatorship which deserves to be smashed.

""This whole incident has shown that America seems to prefer segregation (by all sides) rather than inclusion.""

No it hasn't. When considered relative to other white-on-black justifiable shootings, this case shows that racism is alive and well in the american judicial system.

""Are there are racial disparities in justifiable homicide rulings? Out of 53,000 homicides in the database, 23,000 have a white shooter and a white victim. The shooting is ruled to have been justified in a little more than 2 percent of cases. In states with a SYG law (after enactment), the shooting is ruled to be justified in 3.5 percent of cases, compared to less than 2 percent in non-SYG states. In cases where both the victim and shooter are black, the numbers are almost identical, if slightly lower.

When the shooter and victim are of different races, there are substantial differences in the likelihood a shooting is ruled to be justified. When the shooter is black and the victim is white, the shooting is ruled justified in about 1 percent of cases, and is actually slightly lower in non-SYG states. Between 2005 and 2010, there were 1,210 homicides with a black shooter and a white victim—the shooting was ruled to be justified in just 17 of them (about 1 percent).""

The story is completely different when there is a white shooter and a black victim. In the same time period, there were 2,069 shootings where the shooter was white and the victim black. The homicide was ruled to be justified in 236 cases (11 percent). In SYG states, almost 17 percent of white-on-black shootings were ruled to be justified.

Those statistics as well as data from prisons tell an inconvenient truth. I think ""Equal Justice"" is the next ""Marriage Equality"" if done correctly. As with LGBT marriage, the country hasn't yet realized the extent of our institutionalized discrimination.

FLORI-DUH Defender, okay, if it makes you feel better, Zimmerman is Latino even though he's father is NOT. Maybe you should check some of the job applications around town where LATINOS are asked to mark ""white"" for statistical purposes.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The Jasenovac camp complex consisted of five detention facilities established between August 1941 and February 1942 by the authorities of the so-called Independent State of Croatia. As Germany and its Axis allies invaded and dismembered Yugoslavia in April 1941, the Germans and the Italians endorsed the proclamation of the so-called Independent State of Croatia by the fanatically nationalist, fascist, separatist, and terrorist Ustaša organization on April 10, 1941.

After seizing power, the Ustaša authorities erected numerous concentration camps in Croatia between 1941 and 1945. These camps were used to isolate and murder Jews, Serbs, Roma (also known as Gypsies), and other non-Catholic minorities, as well as Croatian political and religious opponents of the regime. The largest of these centers was the Jasenovac complex, a string of five camps on the bank of the Sava River, about 60 miles south of Zagreb. It is presently estimated that the Ustaša regime murdered between 77,000 and 99,000 people in Jasenovac between 1941 and 1945.

In late August 1941, the Croat authorities established the first two camps of the Jasenovac complex—Krapje and Brocica. These two camps were closed four months later. The other three camps in the complex were: Ciglana, established in November 1941 and dismantled in April 1945; Kozara, established in February 1942 and dismantled in April 1945; and Stara Gradiška, which had been an independent holding center for political prisoners since the summer of 1941 and was converted into a concentration camp for women in the winter of 1942.

The camps were guarded by Croatian political police and personnel of the Ustasa militia, which was the paramilitary organization of the Ustaša movement.

Conditions in the Jasenovac camps were horrendous. Prisoners received minimal food. Shelter and sanitary facilities were totally inadequate. Worse still, the guards cruelly tortured, terrorized, and murdered prisoners at will.

Between its establishment in 1941 and its evacuation in April 1945, Croat authorities murdered thousands of people at Jasenovac. Among the victims were: between 45,000 and 52,000 Serb residents of the so-called Independent State of Croatia; between 12,000 and 20,000 Jews; between 15,000 and 20,000 Roma (Gypsies); and between 5,000 and 12,000 ethnic Croats and Muslims, who were political and religious opponents of the regime.

The Croat authorities murdered between 320,000 and 340,000 ethnic Serb residents of Croatia and Bosnia during the period of Ustaša rule; more than 30,000 Croatian Jews were killed either in Croatia or at Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Between 1941 and 1943, Croat authorities deported Jews from throughout the so-called Independent State to Jasenovac and shot many of them at the nearby killing sites of Granik and Gradina. The camp complex management spared those Jews who possessed special skills or training, such as physicians, electricians, carpenters, and tailors. In two deportation operations, in August 1942 and in May 1943, Croat authorities permitted the Germans to transfer most of Croatia's surviving Jews (about 7,000 in total), including most of those still alive in Jasenovac, to Auschwitz-Birkenau in German-occupied Poland.

As the Partisan Resistance Movement under the command of Communist leader Josip Tito approached Jasenovac in late April 1945, several hundred prisoners rose against the camp guards. Many of the prisoners were killed; a few managed to escape. The guards murdered most of the surviving prisoners before dismantling the last three Jasenovac camps in late April. The Partisans overran Jasenovac in early May 1945.

Determining the number of victims for Yugoslavia, for Croatia, and for Jasenovac is highly problematic, due to the destruction of many relevant documents, the long-term inaccessibility to independent scholars of those documents that survived, and the ideological agendas of postwar partisan scholarship and journalism, which has been and remains influenced by ethnic tension, religious prejudice, and ideological conflict. The estimates offered here are based on the work of several historians who have used census records as well as whatever documentation was available in German, Croat, and other archives in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere.

As more documents become accessible and more research is conducted into the records of the Ustaša regime, historians and demographers may be able to determine more precise figures than are now available.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Fordham’s First Win over Penn is a Record Breaker

Fordham’s First Win over Penn is a Record Breaker

(Photos by Gary Quintal)

By Howard Goldin

BRONX, NEW YORK, OCTOBER 13- The sixth meeting between the Fordham Rams (6-1, 2-0) and the University of Pennsylvania Quakers (0-4, 0-1) took place at Jack Coffey Field in the Bronx on October 11. The game on Saturday was the first victory of Fordham, 60-22, over the Quakers. The two teams seem to be heading in different directions. The win for Fordham was its fifth straight and 11th consecutive home win, and the loss for Penn was its eighth straight. The 60 points scored by the Rams was the most their Ivy League opponent had surrendered in a single game since its 61-0 defeat by #1 ranked Army on November 17, 1945.

The visitors reached the scoreboard first as Penn quarterback Alek Torgerson threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Ryan O’Malley at 10:01. To the credit of the Fordham defense, that intercepted two passes and forced two fumbles, the first Penn touchdown was also its last. The last 16 points scored by the Quakers were off the foot of Jimmy Gammil. The junior kicked the point after touchdown and five field goals.

Fordham scored twice on the ground in the first quarter. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania native Chase Edmunds carried the ball three yards for Fordham’s first points. His 11th touchdown of the season, in only six games, has been topped only five times in Fordham history in a single (full). He rushed for 101 yards, the sixth game in which has rushed for triple figures of yards. He is the first Fordham freshman to have a season rushing yardage total above 1,000 (1,011).

Fordham head coach Joe Moorhead, in his third successful season in the Bronx, spoke very highly of the sensational freshman’s work ethic, preparation, and effort, “He’s an old soul. Everything he’s gotten, he’s earned. It’s not a surprise the success he’s had.”

Quarterback Mike Nebrich, a senior, has also been impressed by the freshman running back, “He’s been huge. It [his rushing] opens up the defense. You can lead as a freshman.”

The second Fordham first quarter touchdown came on a recovered fumble and eight-yard run by senior defenseman DeAndre Slate.

Fordham’s defensive onslaught during the remainder of the game was achieved through the air under the leadership and outstanding ability of quarterback Nebrich. The senior from Virginia spoke of how he sees his responsibility during each contest, “My job is to get us going anytime we start sputtering.”

On Saturday, he completed 36 of 47 passes for a Fordham record of 566 yards, which broke the mark of 524 yards he set in 2013. Six of the 36 completions were for touchdowns, tying a Fordham game mark.

Five different receivers caught touchdown tosses from Nebrich. Tubucky Jones Jr., like Nebrich, a University of Connecticut transfer, caught two, one of 37 yards and one of 47 yards. Jones caught 10 for 203 yards, the eighth highest total in Fordham history. Sam Ajala received eight passes for 199 yards, the ninth highest total.

The 730 yards gained by the Fordham offense was a single game school record and the highest total by an NCAA FCS team this season. According to Moorhead, this success stems from good practice habits and game preparation. The coach also praised his players as being good students and fine human beings as well as good athletes. His own college experience at Fordham has obviously imbued in him the knowledge of what a student-athlete should be.

After Fordham’s bye-week the team will travel to Lehigh for its next contest on October 25. The Rams will return to Jack Coffey Field on November 1 to host Colgate.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"If you have very poor credit, the cheapest car insurance company is Nationwide. Here, your premium will be more than $435 less than the group average. Compared to the highest credit level, drivers with bad credit pay nearly $1,450 more per year for auto insurance. If you pay off a loan or otherwise improve your credit score, you should shop around for car insurance as your premium should change. Just another reason to keep your score up!
You’ll notice that none of that liability coverage pays for your car or injuries, nor for any injuries your passengers sustain if you cause a wreck. This is why many people — particularly those whose car isn’t yet paid off — want “full coverage” car insurance. This isn’t actually a type of coverage, but instead typically refers to policies that include liability coverage, plus comprehensive and collision coverages.

Auto Insurance is required by law for drivers in most states. Drivers who own a car and drive it often should definitely have auto insurance to cover the risk of damages to their car and personal injury and the liability of harm to other people and property. Otherwise, repairs and medical costs, particularly when you’re liable for an accident, can be very expensive.

Liability auto insurance protects you from that worst case scenario by providing a cushion between your assets and the amount you’re on the hook for. For this reason, choosing the right auto liability limits is the most important part of your car insurance quote comparison. NerdWallet typically recommends having at least as much liability coverage as your net worth.
The best car insurance companies have a few things in common: They have straightforward shopping experiences, take good care of policyholders after a crash and treat their customers with respect and courtesy. That means only insurers with high customer satisfaction scores and relatively few complaints to insurance commissioners make it to the top of our list of the best auto insurance companies.
The key difference in collision vs. comprehensive coverage is that, to a certain extent, the element of the car driver's control. As we have stated before, collision insurance will typically cover events within a motorist's control, or when another vehicle collides with your car. Comprehensive coverage generally falls under ""acts of God or nature,"" that are typically out of your control when driving. These can include such events as a spooked deer, a heavy hailstorm, or a carjacking.
The life insurance market has shrunk by around 4% over the last ten years. Interestingly, the market shrunk after the recession then grew about 51% between 2010 and 2015, though it has since begun to drop in size again. In 2017, life insurance premiums exceeded the amount spent in four of the past five years, but still came short of levels seen in 2008 and 2015. Check out our graph below to see how the market has fluctuated in the last decade. All numbers in billions.
Know when to cut coverage. Don’t strip away coverage just for the sake of cheaper insurance. You’ll need full coverage car insurance to satisfy the terms of an auto loan, and you’ll want it as long as your car would be a financial burden to replace. But for older cars, you can drop comprehensive and collision coverage, which only pay out up to your car’s current value, minus the deductible.
The best companies will also have several supplemental coverage options, or endorsements, that you can add to your homeowners policy. Endorsements can vary, as some provide higher coverage limits for certain types of personal property like jewelry or fine furs; or they can provide supplemental coverage for risks — like water backups, floods, or earthquakes — not covered by home insurance.
If you live in an area with unusual state regulations or heightened risk of weather-related claims, shopping car insurance options will be vital. Not every car insurance company offers policies in every state, which can make pricing less competitive. If you live in storm-prone states like Louisiana or Florida, you might find it harder to get a competitive rate.

If you have very poor credit, the cheapest car insurance company is Nationwide. Here, your premium will be more than $435 less than the group average. Compared to the highest credit level, drivers with bad credit pay nearly $1,450 more per year for auto insurance. If you pay off a loan or otherwise improve your credit score, you should shop around for car insurance as your premium should change. Just another reason to keep your score up!

To calculate the added cost in purchasing comprehensive and/or collision coverage we looked at annual insurance quotes for a 30 year old male from New York across four different insurance companies, and the ten best-selling vehicles in the US. We look at the range of rates you could pay from basic liability to policy plans with comprehensive and collision coverage. Collision typically costs more than comprehensive, although some companies require you to carry both rather than just one. Comparing quotes across at least three companies can get you lower car insurance rates.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Road study gets Sampson’s attention

Chris Berendt/Sampson IndependentCounty board chairman Jefferson Strickland, standing, flanked by Commissioners Jarvis McLamb, left, and Albert Kirby, talks about an invitation to a reads impact study announcement in Wayne County and what it could mean to Sampson.

A road economic impact study in Wayne County has drawn the attention of those in Sampson for its future implications — notably the money and jobs it could bring with it.

The U.S. 117/I-795 economic impact assessment study will be unveiled later this month and the Wayne County Transportation Committee sent invitations out to those in surrounding counties interested in learning about the effect of the growth on “citizens, economy, development patterns and lifestyle.”

Sampson County officials were among those invited.

“Many of you are familiar with the new road from Wilson to Goldsboro with a number designation of 795,” Sampson Board of Commissioners chairman Jefferson Strickland told his fellow board members. “The plan is for that road to continue onto Faison and be in Sampson County at the (Interstate) 40/(N.C.) 403 intersection. One of the first meetings to present some of the faces and facts is going to be held in August, and they’ve asked several members of our community to attend.”

Strickland proposed that Jerol Kivett, chairman of the Sampson County Transportation Advocacy Group (TAG), Commissioners Albert Kirby and Billy Lockamy, as well as John Swope, executive director of the Sampson Economic Development Commission, be in attendance at the Aug. 21 meeting at Lane Tree Conference Center in Goldsboro.

The board agreed unanimously.

Interstate 795 is an interstate spur that follows the U.S. 117 corridor from I-95 near Wilson to U.S. 70 in Goldsboro, a length of about 25 miles. There are no other interstates in the eastern portion of North Carolina, east of I-95 and I-40.

Its connectivity with a portion of I-40 in northern Sampson could prove vastly beneficial, local officials attested.

The extension of I-795 southward along the U.S. 117 corridor would connect cities and industrial centers important to national defense, economic growth and job creation, Joe Daughtery, chairman of the Wayne County Transportation Committee, stated in his correspondence to Sampson County and others.

Daughtery cited the potential of $74 million in business and resident cost savings, $520 million in GRP (gross regional product) and nearly $490 million in additional personal income by 2040.

“Employment is projected to grow faster as well, adding about 220 more jobs on average per year along the corridor when compared to not completing the corridor,” he said.

A recently-concluded U.S. 70 Corridor Commission study evaluated the economic development impacts of completing the four-lane freeway bypass system of highways for U.S. 70 from I-40 in Raleigh to the Morehead City State Ports facility; and the conversion of U.S. 117 to I-795 from Goldsboro to I-40.

A U.S. 117 conversion would mean expansion for that road and an impact for I-40 in Sampson, Swope said at the time the study was initiated.

The study team of Cambridge Systematics and the Sanford Holshouser Economic Development Consulting LLC conducted that analysis and are the same team set to conduct the U.S. 117/I-795 economic impact assessment study.

With the Department of Transportation also in the fold, Swope has alluded to exciting possibilities.

“I-795 would be proposed to connect to I-40 near Faison,” Swope said previously. “That would give us a direct route north to I-95, direct access instead of going (west) on I-40 and then catching I-95 North. They would connect to a new I-795, giving people traveling north and south better access than traveling I-40 to I-95.”

State officials said the completion of the highway improvements, has extensive long-term implications for the economic future of eastern North Carolina and the counties along the corridor.

The U.S. 70 Corridor Commission study found that as many as 1,900 jobs could be created each year for communities that rely on the corridor such as Smithfield, Goldsboro, Kinston, New Bern, Havelock and Morehead City. Among other statistics, $1.2 billion could be added to the GRP, including $900 million in additional personal income, and as much as $56 million saved for existing businesses.

Local officials are hoping those positive effects ultimately extend to Sampson.

For years, Swope has sought — and local officials have extended incentives — to attract industries to locate permanently to Exits 348 and 355 off of I-40 in northern Sampson County with mixed success.

Another large interstate would only aid in that pursuit.

“The highest investment value is an interstate,” Swope said last year. “That is what potential investors look for when developing properties. To bring U.S. 117 on as I-795 would be one more strong asset toward improving and strengthening Sampson County’s economy.”

Lockamy said the new road is already getting plenty of use, which bodes well for the counties through which motorists are navigating.

“I traveled that road Saturday evening going into Goldsboro and the traffic was bumper to bumper coming down it,” Lockamy noted. “The traffic is used to it now.”

"Reminder: Things can go bad even when racing slowly.

Those who enter rallies do so knowing full well there's a solid chance their car might not make it out in one piece. Crashing is just part of the rally game. This YouTube video shows how a handful of rally cars met their doom as they entered one very slick, low-speed corner.

A video shared on YouTube Sunday shows action from last weekend's Śląska Rally in Poland—or more specifically, a handful of rally cars at the rally crashing into a ditch. From the looks of the video, the cars came in hot, but not too hot, from a faster stretch of the rally stage, and were forced to slow down to handle the upcoming corner without going off the course. But because of the stretch of road near the corner is wet and muddy, some of the cars—mostly small European hatchbacks—have trouble making the corner. This, in turn, led to them driving into the ditch next to the course.

Going off a stage in rally happens. The important thing is whether you and the helpful spectators around you manage to push the car right-side-up so you can keep hustling down the course.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"August 30, 2011

First amendment gives the Press the right to publish news, information and opinions without government interference.

Sixth amendment guarantees that the defendant is tried in a court open to the public before an impartial jury.

The full accommodation of these seemingly over-lapping fundamental rights is rather challenging. The responsibility to establish a balance between the defendant’s right to a fair trial, the media's right to free speech and the public's right to an open court lies squarely on the shoulders of the presiding judge: Michael Pastor, in our case.

There are several measurements that a judge could employ to establish the aforementioned balance in his court. Jury sequestration is one of them.

JURY SEQUESTRATION

Sequestration is the practice of physically keeping the jury together and totally isolated from outside influences during the trial or deliberation stage, or both. This measure is usually taken only for high profile cases, where the massive media coverage may prejudice the jury's verdict, thus, violating the defendant’s six amendment rights.

In its most extreme form, when not in the courtroom hearing the case, jurors are kept under the constant supervision of a guard at an undisclosed location. Their contact with the outsiders including family is eliminated or curtailed. Any outgoing communication, if any allowed, is monitored to ascertain that their communication doesn’t involve the Trial.

It cost the state of California $3 million to sequester OJ Simpson jury for almost 9 months.

Scott Peterson jury was sequestered only during deliberation period for a week. Mark Geragos, Scott Peterson attorney requested full sequestration during the entire trial. Mr. Geragos stated “This gentleman beside me is fighting with one hand tied behind his back. I'm just trying to level the playing field.”Judge Alfred Delucchi denied the total sequestration request, reasoning that “if I was to tell people you can't see your loved ones for five months, you can't watch television, you can't listen to the radio, you're going to be locked away in a hotel somewhere ... it could have a negative effect on people who could get resentful that they've been locked up.""JudgeDelucchi remarked that the jurors will be exposed to outside influences regardless and that ""the only place this wouldn't happen is if we parked the jury on Mars. We can't do that.""

Michael Jackson 2005 Trial was heard by a non-sequestered jury and despite of the intense worldwide coverage of the trial in detriment of Mr. Jackson, jury rendered

a verdict contrary to the media verdict, acquitting him of all 14 counts of charges.

in the court, stating “we would really like the decision to be made based upon

the evidence that is given in this courtroom and the arguments made inside

this courtroom as opposed to what happens on the Nancy Grace Show”

Judge Pastor asked the prosecution’s stance on the jury sequestration. Deputy Prosecutor David Walgren responded “the court had addressed the issue previously and advised all parties that the court was not inclined to do a sequestering of the jury 24/7. The People were comfortable with the court’s decision. That’s still our position.”

Judge Pastor then declared “at this juncture, I do not feel in any way, shape or form total sequestration of jury is necessary in this case. To have jurors undergo that kind of extraordinary deprivation, quiet frankly, unhealthy to the administration

of justice. I remain confident that jurors follow the law. They follow orders. I feel confident that the jurors understand their responsibility is to follow the evidence and to decide the case on the evidence and not to be influenced by the extraneous materials”. He then advised the defense team to file a motion for his consideration.

On August 18, 2011, Conrad Murray defense team filed a motion requesting jury sequestration. “This is an unusual Trial. There is a reasonable expectation that Dr. Murray’s Trial will be the most publicized in history” stated the motion which then went on to compare Conrad Murray case to Casey Anthony trial. “Television pundits such as Nancy Grace use air time to campaign for the conviction of Ms. Anthony. By feeding on the public anger, Grace’s viewership rose to one and half million per night in June Grace engaged in continuous character assassination with regard to Ms Anthony, the woman she condescendingly referred to as tot mom.”

And then came, in my opinion, highly incendiary and offensive remarks:

“Even if the jurors are instructed not to watch any news coverage, it is unrealistic to expect an unsequestered jury to avoid hearing about the case. Therefore, complete sequestration is necessary to eliminate the high risk of jury contamination. Dr. Murray respectfully asks this court for an order sequestering the jury during the entire trial, including jury deliberations” concluded the defense motion.

On August 25, 2011, Judge Michael Pastor denied the motion to sequester the jury.

Deputy District Attorney David Walgren stated that the prosecution didn’t feel the sequestration was necessary.

“There has to be a level of trust granted to the jurors” ~David Walgren

“Sequestered juries have indicated they have felt like inmates and they feel they were being imprisoned. They are monitored 24/7, they have minimal freedom of movement and they can’t even speak to loved ones without being monitored. Many sequestered jury indicated that they found the sequestration so frustrating, so intimidating and so cruel that it actually interfered with their assessment of the evidence and the law. While I raise the issue of cost, that is not the over-riding consideration. Justice trumps everything"" stated judge Michael Pastor.

Ed Chernoff then stated that in Casey Anthony case media pundits offered their interpretation of the evidence and testimonies, acting as a quasi juror. He then requested that the judge ban the Trial from being televised. “I am suggesting that you consider in-court cameras, maybe amend it to prevent that particular problem” Chernoff said.

Judge Pastor responded “by problem, do you mean the exercise of first amendment? The first amendment is one of those cherished fundamental constitutional rights in the United States. That includes the right to comment.

Judge Michael Pastor then denied the motion for jury sequestration: “I expect that the jurors will follow the high road and that means that they will not be in the receipt of or in contact with information regarding this case. I have tremendous faith in the jury system and in the individual promises of jurors. The defense motion is denied.""

In summary, Conrad Murray jury won't be sequestered and the Trial will be televised.

PROS OF SEQUESTRING JURY

Preventing exposure of the jurors to prejudicial publicity

Minimizing pressure from public for a particular verdict

Ensuring juror safety from harassment during trial

Promoting a perception of fairness due to no outside influences

CONS OF SEQUESTRING JURY

It is financially costly to the government

If an impartial jury isn’t acquired in the first place then it can’t be maintained by means of sequestering

It doesn't undo prejudice based on pretrial media coverage

It imposes jurors emotional harm if the sequestration period is long

It may be counter to truth-seeking because it:

vCan lead to a non-representative jury because only limited categories

of people are available for a jury that will be sequestered.

vCan cause jurors to rush to judgment to escape sequestration.

vCan cause the jurors to identify with the government (as caretaker) or against the government (as the jury’s jailer).

Marcia Clark on jury sequestration

""When jurors are forced to spend day and night with each other, apart from their families and friends, they become a tribe unto themselves. Because they only have each other for company, and because most people prefer harmony to discord, there’s a natural desire to cooperate, to compromise in order to reach agreement. And they have no safe retreat. If they disagree with their fellow jurors, they can’t go home to a husband, a wife, a friend, where they can regroup and marshal their energies. Make no mistake about it, sequestration is no picnic and I have sympathy and respect for the jurors who put up with that incredible hardship.

We can’t ignore the mental and emotional impact it has on the jurors—an impact that thwarts the whole point of drafting twelve individuals to decide a defendant’s fate""~Marcia Clark, OJ Simpson prosecutor

August 26, 2011

Despite of ardent fan protests and a letter from Michael Jackson Estate Executers,

Global Live Events announced that they are “%100 going ahead”. Yesterday, they announced Ne-Yo as part of their line-up. But would Ne-Yo have agreed to be participate IF he knew that Leonard Rowe is involved in 'Michael Forever Tribute'?

In 2007, LiveNations cancelled Janet Jackson’s Tour. Her dancers had counted on income from the Tour so she reached out to Leonard Rowe asking if he could promote

a 20 concert Tour. “I did not believe that she had the drawing power to tour” Leonard Rowe wrote in his book. He tried his best to convince Michael Jackson to tour as Janet being the opening act but there was no convincing Michael. So Mr. Rowe asked R Kelly to tour with Janet Jackson. R Kelley agreed. Later, Janet thought that R Kelley would steal the spotlight so she changed her mind about touring with R Kelly. Leonard Rowe proceeding planning just an R Kelley Tour. He booked Ne Yo as an opening act for R Kelley. Ultimately, both R Kelley and Ne Yo litigated Leonard Rowe.

Ne-Yo sued Leonard Rowe for breach of contract. Leonard Rowe had dropped Ne-Yo from the Tour without merit. On September 4, 2008, Ne-Yo was awarded $700,320

Fast forward to the present day….

﻿“Latoya was the lead one” said Chris Hunt, President of Global Live Events regarding Jackson Family members backing for ‘Michael Forever Tribute’. Latoya and her company is very much involved & vested in the tribute. Paul Ring, vice president of Ja Tail business development, is also ""Head of US Operations, Global Live Events""

Global Live Events CEO, Eric Bute directed Latoya's ""Home' song

Ja Tail made a minor change in their website recently. The nature of the change is blaringly evident: to conceal Leonard Rowe involment in 'Michael Forever Tribute'. With his unpleasant history with Rowe, Ne-Yo might have had reservations in performing in the tribute had he known the Rowe connection. So they surreptitiously deleted evidence.﻿﻿

August 24, 2011

""We are %100 going ahead. We will continue to announce names for the line-up.

We are moving forward and now we will try to address issues that have been raised by fans"" Global Live Events stated, inviting verified Michael Jackson fanclubs to take part in a conference call on August 30, in which our concerns will be allayed.

We have been Michael Jackson fans and members of fanclubs for our entire lives yet

we are not aware of the ""verified fanclub” concept. Do you doubt our fanship? When Mr. Jackson was alive, never once did he limit his communications only to “verified Michael Jackson fanclubs”. We don't hear this utter nonsense from his Estate Executers either. We are ALL verified in the sense that we would walk through fire to make sure that an audacious company doesn’t cheapen Michael Jackson legacy and brand.

We do not want our concerns allayed, we would like them resolved and how can resolution be possible if your very first step towards us is “we are %100 going ahead”?The so-called tribute is taking place during Conrad Murray Trial. Our most pressing concern is the timing. It is futile to elaborate on why the timing is utterly inappropriate

for any decent human-being should be able to connect the dots.

Your invitation to fans is simply a PR stunt in light of adverse media coverage of your event. Your assertion of “we have been listening to the fans” is a bold-faced lie. We started our campaign BECAUSE you refuse to listen to us and consistently delete our comments from your facebook! We learnt from experience and started screen-capping our comments before you delete them. Here is a comment you deleted yesterday:

In a letter dated August 15, 2011, Michael Jackson Estate declared to Global Live Events

""Estate is the only entity that can grant the right to use Michael Jackson’s name, likeness or any of his intellectual property, whether such use is commercial or other purposes. We assume that you do not intend to use any intellectual property controlled by the Estate""

How does your company leap from receiving this communiqué from the Estate Executers

of Michael Jackson to selling tickets to commercialize a brand that is not your property?

Michael Jackson Estate is the single entity who owns and is responsible to protect the integrity of Michael Jackson brand which we believe you are tainting by an exceedingly questionable event marred with negative publicity. Adding insult to injury, you dub this lackluster event as a Michael Jackson “tribute”.Estate Executors communicated with you that “in light of confusion surrounding this ‘event’ we are extremely concerned about Michael’s legacy. We believe Global Live should address our concerns….”

Global Live Events owe Michael Jackson Estate Executers through and through explanation before they proceed. Your failure to seek Estate's approval demonstrates your lack of respect to the very man you are allegedly honoring.Let me remind you that it is your legal and moral obligation to the Estate Executors to resolve every single issue surrounding the event and have their approval before “%100 going ahead”

We realize that your financial interest indeed outweighs integrity. There is nothing decent about exploiting Mr. Jackson’s death for financial gain, doing so during Conrad Murray Trial and exploiting his young children as an advertising tool. We find the exploitation of Michael's children in your terms and conditions document totally abhorrent. Michael Jackson wrote a song about your ilk titled “money”, will that song be in the tribute line up?

Which brings us to another legal issue to be contended with.

﻿﻿﻿

﻿﻿﻿

Mr. Jackson worked very hard to build one of the most profitable brands of all time. His brand stands for unsurpassed quality and “magic”.There is nothing quality or magical about Michael Forever Tribute which is simply a circus show of has-beens or rookies.

You stated that you have the backing of “overwhelming majority” of the Jackson Family. So what? Jackson Family doesn’t own Michael Jackson brand, his Estate does…solely. Jackson family has no authority to broker Michael image, likeness and songs all of which you declared you will exploit. The Executers clearly communicated to you that you do NOT have their permission to use their intellectual property. Either you intend to violate copyright laws or you are defrauding public by false advertising.

Unless you show willingness to modify terms surrounding Michael Forever Tribute, including but not limited to the timing & unless a representative of Michael Jackson Estate is present, our answer to your conference call is a resounding NO!

We propose that you proceed with the concert but cease and desist the use of Michael Jackson name, likeness & songs. This is a reasonable compromise.

Most of your attendees are fans of the participating artists. Since you are determined to “go ahead” and we are determined not to let that happen with the current terms, why don't we reach an agreement where everyone wins? Our proposal satisfies all parties:

August 22, 2011

Gentlemen, we are writing you once again in regards to the Michael Forever Tribute.

As you know, Michael Jackson worldwide fan community ardently objects and protests the October 2011 tribute. The fans who cherished a very closed-knit relationship with Mr. Jackson would want nothing more than a befitting tribute in his honor…but in due time & organized with utmost care and professionalism.

Under the current circumstances, Michael Forever tribute produces an outcome opposite of what is being marketed. The tribute is simply tasteless, improper, impractical, insensitive and disrespectful. There is no way to resolve the issues we have with this tribute. Since the announcement of this tribute, the fan community has been upset and unable to focus on the upcoming trial. Every day, we wake up hoping for a cancellation and to our dismay, we encounter deafening silence. We've learnt that Michael Forever Tribute facebook is maintained by a ticketing company who doesn't have answers.

Estate Executers had asked you to “address our concerns and those of Michael's loyal fans”. To date, you haven’t communicated with neither the fans nor the Executors of Michael Jackson -you know, the gentelman you are purportedly paying tribute to. If you don’t respect his Estate or his fans then where do you get off monetizing Michael Jackson’s name? You don’t even bother answering simple customer service questions about the event, let alone addressing grave concerns which were made known to you. Yet you proceed to selling tickets nonchalantly. Global Live Events could really benefit from a crash course on business ethics, integrity, professionalism and customer service.

You are prolonging an unpleasant situation to gauge if you could garner enough ticket buyers who are fans of the attending artists. Do you think that the negative media coverage is beneficial for your company reputation or ticket sales?

Since you don't have enough regard for Michael Jackson to cancel out of respect for him, since your corporate aspirations weigh heavier than doing what’s morally right, we propose this compromise: Drop Michael's name and proceed with the concert with the artists you already booked, including the Jacksons. We only request that you don’t use or refer to Mr. Jackson’s name in any shape or form and that the participating artists including the Jacksons don't butcher…I mean attempt to sing Mr. Jackson’s songs.We find this to be a reasonable compromise for all.

We present our offer for your consideration and expect preferably an immediate cancellation or a modification. Look forward to your response as practicable as possible.

August 19, 2011

Thank you for your prompt reaction in regards to the Michael Forever Tribute.

We realize that unlike fans who react with raw emotion, the Estate executors approach matters with composed diplomacy and that there is a legal chain of actions to be followed. The Fan Community is in total agreement with every concern outlined in the letter from the Estate to the Michael Forever Tribute organizers. And whilst we are confident that the Estate will follow through and take the necessary legal actions in the event that the organizers aren’t compliant, we would like to communicate with you our sentiments in regard to some disconcertingissues relevant to the Michael Forever tribute.

Timing: The Fan Community feels that the timing of this event aims to exploit

the Conrad Murray trial. It is exceedingly insensitive, tasteless and improper.

Caliber of artists: We feel that Michael Forever Tribute isn’t a tribute to honor Michael Jackson. It is merely a concert of various artists but the organizers exploit Michael Jackson’s name to garner interest in the event. The participating artists aren’t selected carefully based on the special connection they may have to Mr. Jackson. Rather, Global Live Events extends invitations to any artist who may agree to participate. They are scraping the bottom of the barrel. We feel that the haphazard and sloppy organization so far will not produce a fitting tribute. We would like the official Tribute to come in due time, preferably organized by Michael’s children and sanctioned by his Estate.

Questionable intent: We feel that the intention of the tribute isn’t to pay homage to Michael Jackson but to capitalize on his good name. We don’t feel that a mere concert with mosaic of artists thrown together on the 11th hour is a suitable tribute

Aptitude of Global Live Events: The Company was formed on March 29, 2011. As evidenced by their incompetency so far, we feel that the inexperienced organizers will fall short in organizing a deserving tribute to Michael Jackson.

Paul Ring who is dubbed as ""Global Live Events Executive"" is also Latoya's employee. This screams conflict of interest. Latoya appears to be the force behind this exploitation of Michael & his children under the guise of a ""tribute"".

﻿

Latoya Jackson 'Starting Over' book, page 340

﻿

Global Live Events CEO Eric Bute & Latoya Jackson

Questionable ticketing: We don't get a sense that this tribute is for L.O.V.E.

It is all about money. Fans are required to pledge to charities in addition to the ticket price. Surreptitiously, the organizers use fans’ donations to assert that

the tribute is for a charitable cause. Then why aren’t they donating part of their profits to charities? We don’t even know where the proceedings are going.

Ticketing policy: The organizer declared “If %50 or more of the contracted artists ATTEND OR PERFORM, the concert will take place and NO refunds will be offered”. We believe that the %50 is covered by the Jacksons' appearances and that the announced artists may attend but not necessarily perform. Attending public should receive exactly what the organizers advertised, they shouldn't be short-changed or duped. The promoter aims to cheat the public with fine print. Doing so in Michael's name dishonors Michael's good name & memory.

Gene Simmons:Global Live Events invited someone who not only made public disparaging remarks about Michael but also his children. We feel that the organizer should have been more diligent in carefully selecting artists. We can forgive Mrs. Jackson; due to her age, perhaps she didn’t know who Kiss is or about Gene Simmons remarks but it's hard to believe that Jackson siblings didn’t know about it. We feel that they proceeded despite of the knowledge.

When we TRIED communicating our concerns about Kiss, our voices fell on deaf ears. Promoter deleted our comments from its facebook and tweeted a promotional video nonchalantly. It took a letter from the Estate for them to address this issue. They shut out the very people they are trying to sell tickets to.

After dropping Kiss today from their line-up, the organizer released this statement:

“We have listened to Michael's fans and are grateful to have been alerted to these unfortunate statements by Gene Simmons. Under the circumstances,

we fully agree that even though Kiss is a band Michael admired, we have no choice but to rescind our invitation to them to appear in our tribute”

Whom Global Live Events heard was NOT “Michael’s fans” but a potential lawsuit and the possibility of the Estate Executers throwing a monkey wrench into their event. We are also displeased by their absurd remark that Michael admired Kiss. That is a completely inaccurate nonsense. We do NOT feel right about Global Live Events, we do not trust them, we do not wish to do business with them.

Recent headlines dragged Mr. Jackson’s name in mud so close to the jury selection to the Conrad Murray trial. We feel this may have tainted the potential jury pool. We do not feel that dropping Kiss suffices. The damage is already done. We didn't sense any genuine regret from the statement by Global Live Events.

WE DO NOT ACCEPT THEIR APOLOGY!

Most of the attendees are fans of participating artists. Michael Jackson fans are troubled that his name is used to sell this concert. If they desire to proceed, then they should just market it as a concert event without involving MJ's name into it.

With the upcoming criminal trial, fans would like to focus only on the trial. We find it near impossible to do so because of constant debacles related to this tribute.

It’s Michael Forever Tribute. His mother, siblings and children are involved. The use of Michael Jackson image and likeness is bound to happen.We cordially request that the Estate commence the necessary steps to acertain that this Tribute either doesn’t happen or it doesn’t happen as a Michael Jackson tribute.

We hope that you will attend this matter in a timely manner so that the storm in our community may pass & we may focus on the upcoming Conrad Murray trial.

We, as Michael Jackson's staunch supporters, refuse to support the Michael Forever Tribute, planned by Global Live Events in October, 2011. Even after the removal of Kiss, we feel that the damage is already done. This colossal mistake could have been avoided, had you exerted the diligence required to organize a befitting tribute. You have proven that you will book just any artist who affirms your invitation. This monumental mistake cannot be forgiven, given the magnitude of the damage it caused so close to the criminal trial. Your apology is too little too late and it does not solve the problems we have with this tribute in general.

Since the initial announcement of the event, fans tried communicating with you in regards to our very valid concerns, have we not? Instead of acknowledging, hearing and working together with us, you have deleted “selected” comments from your facebook page, forcing us to form our own facebook Group: Fans Against Michael Forever Tribute.It shouldn't have come to this. Any company who conducts business in Michael Jackson's name should better know that Michael and his fans have cherished a close-knit relationship where we were always heard and communicated with. We refuse to be treated this way by you!

You only addressed the Gene Simmons issue after the Estate's letter. Therefore, the contention that you ""listened to Michael's fans"" is empty words uttered to save face in the media. Global Live Events rescinded their offer to Kiss only to qualm the media and the Estate. Simply put, the Kiss cancellation is merely a product of the negative media coverage which stood to affect ticket sales and your profit. It was not done out of respect to Michael Jackson. You've no respect for Michael.

The timing of this tribute in the middle of Conrad Murray's trial, ticketing arrangements, faraway location, obscurity over what charities will be receiving the donations, obscurity over who is pocketing the profits, no-guarantee policy of performers.....the issues with this tribute keep piling up, thus, breaking our focus away from the criminal trial. We find this very upsetting. The addition of Gene Simmons, thus, tarnishing Michael Jackson's name was simply the last straw for us. With the damage you caused, it will be us fans having to fix your mistake.

Michael Forever Tribute is not proper at this time for myriad of reasons. We hope we can resolve this matter amicably so that perhaps in the future when a Tribute is planned, you could be part of the production, with more care and diligence.

Understand that we will not rest until this tribute is cancelled. We do NOT care who from the Jackson family is supporting it. We condemn the exploitation of Michael's children & his mother to legitimatize your tribute!!!

We cordially invite you to announce the cancellation of Michael Forever Tribute.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"In aged humans, stroke is a major cause of disability for which no neuroprotective measures are available. In animal studies of focal ischemia, short-term hypothermia often reduces infarct size. Nevertheless, efficient neuroprotection requires long-term, regulated lowering of whole-body temperature. Previously, it is reported that post-stroke exposure to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) effectively lowers whole-body temperature and confers neuroprotection in aged animals. Here we report for the first time that the animals exposed to H2S the normal sleepâ€“wake oscillations are replaced by a low-amplitude EEG dominated by a 4-Hz rhythmicactivity, reminiscent of EEG recordings in hibernating animals. In the present study using magnetic resonance imaging, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunofluorescence, we characterized the central nervous system response to H2S -induced hypothermia and report, that annexin A1, a major constituent of peripheral leukocytes that is upregulated after stroke, was consistently downregulated in polymorphonuclear cells in the peri-lesional cortex of post-ischemic, aged rat brain after 48 hours of hypothermia induced by exposure to H2S. This might be due to the reduced kinetics of recruitment, adherence and infiltration of PMN cells by H2S -induced hypothermia. Our findings further suggest that, in contrast to monotherapies that have thus far uniformly failed in clinical practice, prolonged hypothermia has pleiotropic effects on brain physiology that may be necessary for effective protection of the brain after stroke.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The Miami Art Museum and Miami Art Central announced last week that they are forming a partnership in presenting exhibitions of original art works to the public. The move comes as plans by the Miami Art Museum move ahead for creation of an expanded museum. In six months, the two organizations plan to evaluate a possible merger. Whatever the outcome, the development means added impetus to the campaign to build a new museum in downtown Miami and heralds expanded relationships between public and private art institutions here.

Playing a key role in the partnership is Ella Fontanals-Cisneros, who founded Miami Art Central with the objective, she says, of stimulating an active dialogue with the community through exhibitions and education programs reflecting the interests of the local community.

The facility of Cuba-born Mrs. Cisneros is in a 1940s building in South Miami formerly occupied by Southern Bell Co., renovated under the direction of Italian architect Alessandro Fiorentino. It features 20,000 square feet of exhibition space on two floors where five major exhibitions per year and special events are staged.

"Prep for Changing Brake Pad Material

Should I fully sand my rotors if Im changing pad material?

I understand the basics of disc brakes in that a little bit of the pad material imbeds itsself in the rotors as part of the normal process of braking. This would lead me to believe sanding is necessary. The problem is of course that Im a little lazy.

If it matters, I would be coming off EBC Red pads, which they say are a type of organic material, and moving back to the stock Shimano sintered pads.

I originally left the Shimano pads as they were howlingly loud and had ok success with the EBC's. They are starting to wear fast however, and I now have at least 4 brand new sets of the Shimano's laying around, so I figure I'll try them again rather than spending more money.

Frankly I don't think that's necessary. I would suggest simply changing them out for new pads of whatever compound and then breaking them in. Whenever you change brake pads, independent of compound, you must break them in again.

For God's Sake!

Do NOT sand your rotors. Clean them with isopropyl alcohol, wipe dry with a nice clean rag and keep your greasy, KFC-eatin' fingers offa them. Change out the pads, making sure to center them correctly and then go ride your bike.

Well, I know I would need to break in the new pads, but doing that on top of the older material and mixing the 2 is what I was questioning.

The actuall process of breaking in pads is where through application of the brakes the pad material imbeds in the rotor surface gradually getting you up to full braking performance.

What I dont know is: will the new pad material just push out the old with no problem? Or will they mix and decrease braking performance?

It would be highly unusual for the use of one pad material to interfere with the efficacy of another material on a standard metal rotor in such a way as to noticeably affect braking performance, particularly if the rotor were thoroughly cleaned beforehand. That's my opinion. There may be some kind of materials scientist out there who may know about something going on in the meso-scale that I don't who may disagree with what I just said, but I don't think so.

As far as I'm concerned there's no need to do anything to the rotor when switching between different types of pads. I have a set of older Shimano XTs where I switch to the stock metallic pads when riding up at my friends cottage and use organic ones when riding in the city. I just drop the pads in and they work just fine, no need to clean the rotors or pads. I've switched back & forth many times over the years and I've never had any problems.

It would be highly unusual for the use of one pad material to interfere with the efficacy of another material on a standard metal rotor in such a way as to noticeably affect braking performance, particularly if the rotor were thoroughly cleaned beforehand. That's my opinion. There may be some kind of materials scientist out there who may know about something going on in the meso-scale that I don't who may disagree with what I just said, but I don't think so.

All cleaning them with alcohol will do is remove oils, dirt, etc.

IF the previous pad material should in fact be removed to optimize performance, alcohol isn't going to do it.

IF the previous pad material should in fact be removed to optimize performance, alcohol isn't going to do it.

The rotor has micropores in it that may have captured some pad material, maybe several micrograms at most. If you are being told by a manufacturer or dealer someplace that such an infinitesimally small amount of previous material will somehow interfere with the performance of your new brake pads (which it won't), then you probably need to find a new brand of rotor, brake and pad. The bottom line is this: there is no credible reason to believe that removal of previous pad material is necessary unless you have done something highly unusual with your brakes or are using them for some highly unusual application or there is some highly unusual condition that you are not mentioning in this forum.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Fish poisoning may be why Polynesians left paradise

Washington, May 19 (ANI): Scientists have come up with a theory that attributes the historic migrations of the Polynesians from the Cook islands to New Zealand, Easter Island and Hawaii in the 11th to 15th centuries, to fish poisoning.

The theory has been proposed by Teina Rongo, a Cook Island Maori from Rarotonga and a Ph.D. student at the Florida Institute of Technology, and his faculty advisers Professors Robert van Woesik and Mark Bush.

Based on archeological evidence, paleoclimatic data and modern reports of ciguatera poisoning, they theorize that ciguatera outbreaks were linked to climate and that the consequent outbreaks prompted historical migrations of Polynesians.

Ciguatera poisoning is a food-borne disease that can come from eating large, carnivorous reef fish, and causes vomiting, headaches, and a burning sensation upon contact with cold surfaces.

It is known that the historic populations of Cook Islanders was heavily reliant on fish as a source of protein, and the scientists suggest that once their fish resources became inedible, voyaging became a necessity.

Modern Cook Islanders, though surrounded by an ocean teeming with fish, don’t eat fish as a regular part of their diet but instead eat processed, imported foods.

In the late 1990s, lower-income families who could not afford processed foods emigrated to New Zealand and Australia.

The researchers suggest that past migrations had similar roots.

The heightened voyaging from A.D. 1000 to 1450 in eastern Polynesia was likely prompted by ciguatera fish poisoning.

There were few options but to leave once the staple diet of an island nation became poisonous.

According to van Woesik, “Our approach brings us a step closer to solving the mysteries of ciguatera and the storied Polynesian native migrations. We hope it will lead to better forecasting and planning for ciguatera outbreaks.” (ANI)",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The United States and Japan will step up their defence cooperation to deal with the threat from nuclear-armed North Korea as tensions in East Asia remain high, officials from the two allies said on Thursday.

Mr Wright started a relationship with Elizabeth after divorcing three earlier wives.

Olivia is the youngest of Mr Wright's four children but she had a difficult relationship with her father, who was frequently absent and gave little support for her single mother before his death in 2012.

She had not met older siblings Leonie Baldock, Alexandra Burt and Myles Wright prior to his death.

Olivia challenged her father's will because her $3 million trust fund had onerous conditions and could not be accessed until she was the age of 30.

She sought an immediate $12 million share of her father's estate, estimated at more than $1 billion, but in February the WA Supreme Court instead awarded her $25 million, the largest such payout in Australian legal history.

Olivia told the Seven Network's Sunday Night program there had been many personal hurdles during her long legal battle.

While she is ready to contest the appeal, she said she's unsure if she would go through the initial legal battle again.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

I've also created a virtual host that responds to any inbound address on port 85. However, the connection is getting refused.

Since multiple things could be going wrong, it's best to try and diagnose the issue by progressing incrementally. By default the firewall is disabled so unless you enabled it, that shouldn't be an issue which leaves the web server and the EC2 security groups.

"Marginal improvement in Assam situation

Last updated on: November 21, 2003 13:13 IST

An uneasy calm prevails in Assam with no major incident of violence reported overnight while curfew in worst-hit Tinsukia town was relaxed for two hours from 11.30 a.m. to enable people to buy essential commodities.

Official sources in Guwahati said the fear of reprisal continues to stalk some residents of Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Dhubri, Bongaigaon and Nalbari towns. In Nalbari, curfew was suspended for 10 hours from 6 am.

The curfew in Tinsukia and Dibrugarh districts has hit train services. The districts have a sizeable Bihari population but many opted to leave the state and made a beeline for railway stations.

Dibrugarh district Deputy Commissioner N Verma told PTI that the dusk-to-dawn curfew was clamped from 5 pm to 5 am in the oil town of Duliajan, the fertiliser town of Namrup, Tengakhat, Tingkhong and Moran to prevent any fresh outbreak of violence.

Prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code continued to remain in force in Bihari-dominated areas in Dibrugarh district.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The Freedom of Choice

In every moment we have a choice. The freedom to choose our actions that create our day, month and year all adding up to the life we are creating for ourself. Even if you think are not choosing, you are. No decision is a decision. The choices we make either support our goals and the life we truly want to live or they are taking us further away. Our choices cause us to feel great pleasure in our life or they are creating pain and suffering. Without focusing on the past too much, reflect back on the last couple of days, the last week or even the last month. What choices have you made that led you to where you are or allowed you to stay stagnant with no growth at all? What do you want to accomplish? How do you want to feel? If you’re not sure what choices you have made, then just look at your actions.

If you want to lose weight and you choose to not work out or eat fast food, than the choices you are making do not support your goal. Every time you look in the mirror and see no progress you create pain and suffering for yourself. If you want a new job, but you don’t update your résumé, network or apply for jobs, than your choices are not supporting your goal and everyday when you go to work at a job you don’t want to be at, you create pain and suffering for yourself. If you are unhappily in a relationship and you choose to complain to everyone around you, rather than communicating to your partner to see how they feel, make an effort to improve your relationship by working on you or decide to end the relationship, than you create pain and suffering for yourself and your partner. How about anytime you need to drive somewhere you have never been and are unfamiliar with. If your goal is to arrive at your destination, you can choose to put the address into the navigation on your phone, print out directions, use a map, or you could just get in the car and drive, hoping that you get there. Which choice will allow you to arrive at your destination? Which choice do you think will give you more pleasure than pain?

You can take this formula and apply it to any part of your life. The formula to feeling pleasure is not complicated, but it’s also very easy to feel pain and suffering. So you have a choice, what do you want to feel, pleasure or pain? Choice is a decision to take action or not.Tony Robbins said, “A real decision is measured by the fact that you’ve taken a new action. If there is no action, you haven’t truly decided.” So whatever your goals are, whatever life you want to create for yourself, the first thing you have to do is choose to take actions that will support your goal so you can ultimately feel more pleasure and less pain.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Oxford Instruments - Trading Update

Oxford Instruments plc, a leading provider of high technology products and services to industrial companies and scientific research communities, is today issuing a trading update.

Given the current uncertainty from Covid-19 and the impact on trading, Oxford Instruments plc is issuing its pre-close for the financial year 2019/20 earlier than usual.

The severe disruption as a result of Covid-19 has impacted our customers, with a number of product shipments and installations in the final quarter of the financial year being delayed, in addition to an enforced site closure in California. While we are seeing some re-opening of customer sites in China, the situation in Europe and North America is deteriorating. As a result, the Group currently expects adjusted operating profit for the full year of between £47m to £50m.

Looking ahead, we expect current events to adversely impact trading during the first half of the financial year 2020/21, but at this stage there remains considerable uncertainty. The Group has a strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity, with net cash of over £50m. We operate in robust markets with a well-positioned portfolio of products and solutions for attractive end markets. We remain committed to our strategy and would expect trading to recover in line with a reduction in disruption from Covid-19.

Oxford Instruments' results for the year ended 31 March 2020 will be released on 9 June 2020.

Note: Oxford Instruments compiled consensus analyst forecast for adjusted operating profit (year to 31 March 2020) is £53.3m. This excludes analysts that have not updated forecasts following the disposals of OI Healthcare and our share in Scienta Omicron.

"This pattern is what we call the progress principle: of all the positive events that influence inner work life, the single most powerful is progress in meaningful work; of all the negative events, the single most powerful is the opposite of progress—setbacks in the work. We consider this to be a fundamental management principle: facilitating progress is the most effective way for managers to influence inner work life. Even when progress happens in small steps, a person’s sense of steady forward movement toward an important goal can make all the difference between a great day and a terrible one. This pattern became increasingly obvious as the diaries came in from all the teams in our study. People’s inner work lives seemed to lift or drag depending on whether or not their projects moved forward, even by small increments. Small wins often had a surprisingly strong positive effect, and small losses a surprisingly strong negative one. We tested our impressions more rigorously in two ways. Each confirmed the power of progress to dominate inner work life.

And this can spur innovation:

On days when people have made real progress in work that matters to them, they end the day feeling more intrinsically motivated—turned by their interest in and enjoyment of the work. There’s plenty of research showing that, when people are more intrinsically motivated, they are more likely to be creative. This means that when your subordinates have pulled off a real accomplishment, they may be more open to new, challenging work that calls for creativity. In other words, they should be particularly eager to take on vexing problems and find creative solutions following days of notable progress.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The Essential Air Fryer Cookbook

by Bruce Weinstein

With more than 7 million sold in America, air fryers are the next Instant Pot: the new hot kitchen appliance home cooks have to have–and Bruce Weinstein and Mark Scarbrough are here to help you make the most of it.

Initially conceived as a way of producing crispy “fried” foods with half the calories and fat, the air fryer is more than just a diet trick. It’s also the best, easiest way to cook with the power of a commercial convection oven at home, producing the crispiest roasted vegetables, perfectly-cooked chicken with crunchy skin, and, yes, the most delicious french fries you’ll ever make without digging out a deep fryer.

With more than 300 delicious, unpretentious, and totally customisable recipes for everything from entire meals cooked inside the air fryer to party snacks, healthy sides, and delicious desserts, this book will be the go-to resource for this year’s hottest home cooking appliance.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Home > US 10-year Treasury yields are flat to down slightly; NZD has ended up one of the better performers as short-positions were likely pared; the weaker USD since this time yesterday likely reflects a reduction in long positioning

US 10-year Treasury yields are flat to down slightly; NZD has ended up one of the better performers as short-positions were likely pared; the weaker USD since this time yesterday likely reflects a reduction in long positioning

Following yesterday’s rout in global equities a risk-off tone remains evident, with the S&P500 making further losses overnight, while US 10-year Treasury yields are flat to down slightly. Despite the fall in risk appetite, the NZD has ended up one of the better performers as short-positions were likely pared.

After we went to print yesterday, US equities lunged further into negative territory and this spilled over into global markets, with NZ’s high-flying equity market ending down a chunky 3.6%. No single trigger can adequately explain the sudden plunge in equity markets but a number of factors can be pointed at, including US rates having reached a tipping point late into the cycle, worries about the impact of higher oil prices, escalating US-China tensions (not just on trade but at a military level as well), an over-valued tech sector and allegations of Chinese chip-makers including devices in products to spy on their overseas customers, to name a few.

Overnight, President Trump blamed the Fed for the market rout saying “The Fed is out of control…I think what they’re doing is wrong”, but adding that he wasn’t going to fire Fed Chair Powell. This followed his comments yesterday that the Fed has gone crazy and was making a mistake.

The S&P500 has spent most of the session so far in negative territory, down as much as 1½% recently and currently down about 1%, to sit just below its 200-day moving average. Earlier in the year the index broke down through that technical indicator a number of times but not for very long and recovered each time. Another lurch lower could well feed on itself, while a bounce would get the buy-the-dip brigade back into action, so we’re currently at an interesting juncture.

Of some relief, US CPI inflation was lower than expected for the second month in a row, with the annual core measure staying steady at 2.2% y/y. The market still thinks another rate hike is likely in December as the tighter labour market forewarns future inflationary pressure, but the softer inflation data supports the Fed’s gradual approach to raising rates.

In other news, Dow Jones reported that President Trump is going to meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi at the G20 meeting next month. Later, Larry Kudlow told reporters he ""can't officially"" confirm Trump and Xi are planning to meet, saying only it's under discussion.

US Treasury yields have settled in a 3.14-3.19% range since the open of the Asian trading session, following the 8bps decline in late NY trading yesterday. Despite the softer inflation data, the 2-year rate shows some upward drift and is up 2bps from the NZ close compared to the flat 10-year rate. The market is taking the view that equity markets would have to show a much larger downward correction to sway the Fed from its gradual tightening path.

In currency markets, the NZD has outperformed despite the weaker risk appetite environment and has blasted up over 1% through the 0.65 mark and is higher on all the crosses. While this is unusual, in a big risk-off event the natural behaviour of traders is to shut down or reduce positions. Positioning in the NZD has been significantly short – the greatest on record according to CFTC data for non-commercial positions in the futures market – so NZD strength at a time like this suggests some short covering. Indeed, currency movements over the past 24 hours or so tells us a lot about positioning. The AUD has also outperformed but not to the extent of the NZD. The AUD has blasted up through 0.71, while NZD/AUD is up to 0.9160. With positioning a key factor behind the moves we wouldn’t read too much into them or want to extrapolate the move too far into the future.

The weaker USD since this time yesterday likely reflects a reduction in long positioning, although Trump’s outburst against the Fed and the softer CPI data haven’t helped either. USD indices are down around 0.4-0.5% for the day. EUR is up 0.6% to 1.1590 while GBP is flat around the 1.32 mark. Brexit headlines remain confusing and conflicting. Italy remains a focus for the market and rates are modestly higher there ahead of Italy submitting its Budget. EU economy chief Moscovici said he’ll try to bring Italy “closer” to EU spending rules in negotiations over the country’s 2019 budget.

Finally, oil prices have retreated again. Alongside data showing some inventory build, OPEC cut its estimate for global demand for its crude next year by 900k barrels per day due to weakening economic growth and higher output from rivals, notably US shale drillers. Brent crude is down 3% to $80.60 and well down from the $86.70 peak of mid-last week.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

World of final fantasy - The five Cogna lords Port Besaid & Nibelheim Ep80

In the main story we need to face the five Cogna lords that are currently running rampant across the world of Grymoire. Firstly we tackle the Cogna residing in Port Besaid which is a very easy airborne enemy but the one afterwards in Nibelheim was not so easy! He did look awesome though :D
World of Final Fantasy is a role-playing video game which utilizes a turn-based battle system. It is is primarily set in the world of Grymoire, a land populated by classic Final Fantasy characters and monsters from across the series, while being unconnected to any other series entry. Lann and Reynn suffer from amnesia and hold the power in one of their arms to capture and wield Mirages, the monsters of Grymoire. They travel to Grymoire to recover their memories.

"Book Review: Crochet Saved My Life

Sunday, March 10, 2013

If you’ve ever turned to your hooks
and yarn when times were hard, you will probably see yourself in Crochet Saved My Life: The Mental and Physical Health Benefits of Crochet. Kathryn Vercillo, the blogger behind Crochet Concupiscence, has written and self-published this compelling
non-fiction book which tells the stories of 24 crocheters (including
herself) who attest to the healing power of crochet.

Kathryn’s personal experience using
crochet as part of a comprehensive plan to manage her depression
sparked her interest in researching the mental, physical, and social
benefits of crochet. The book takes a journalistic approach to
exploring research into the potential for using crochet as part of a
treatment plan for several physical and mental health conditions
(depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, addiction, post
traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipopular disorder,
Alzheimer’s and other age related memory conditions, and stress).
Kathryn also explores the use of crochet as part of pain management
and occupational therapy regimens.

Each chapter includes a clearly written
overview of research as well as existing programs using crochet (or
other needlecrafts) to treat these conditions. Kathryn’s writing
style is accessible and casual, but she has clearly done her homework
and documents her sources. She also peppers the anecdotal
experiences of the many crocheters she interviewed for the book
throughout the relevant chapters, so you can learn about how crochet
helped them manage their health.

The book includes appendices with
mindfulness activities, hand stretches, and other exercises for
crocheters. Kathryn also shares the complete story of each crafter
she interviewed in “Meet the Crafters” profiles. Crocheters who
are active online will recognize many of Kathryn’s interview
subjects, who include bloggers, Etsy sellers, and designers. The
profiles provide a personal touch and a window into the many ways
that crocheting, creativity, and a community of crafters can support
healing during difficult times.

Although the book is self-published, it
is well written and thoroughly edited. Other than the unconventional
font (which is highly readable), there is little to distinguish it
from a book produced by a major publishing house. Before picking up
the book, I feared it would be depressing, but it is actually quite
uplifting and inspiring. Through the profiles of these creative
women, the reader gets to experience the healing powers of crochet.

Fans of Kathryn’s blog will recognize her conversational tone and
enjoy the opportunity to learn more about other active members of the
online crochet community. This book would also make a delightful
gift for anyone in a helping profession or caregivers, since there
are some great suggestions for using crochet specifically and
needlecrafts in general to support healing.

Retail price:
$17.95 (paperback), $9.99 (Kindle edition). This book is also
available to borrow via the Kindle Lending Library for Amazon Prime

"Why knowing your purpose saves you so much time in life

I used to be a person who always wanted to please everyone in my life. The truth of it is that there is nothing wrong in wanting to make those around you proud however it becomes a barrier for your life when you do things just to please everyone around you. I would say that discovering your purpose early in life is one of the best things that you can do for yourself. It prevents you from so many unwanted obstacles that you could possible face.

When I was younger, I honestly thought that I knew what I wanted to do with my life. In fact, I was sure that was the correct profession for me because I loved it so much. No one forced me to think in that direction nor did I feel any pressure from society to want to pursue said career. To even prove my honest desire for this profession, I went to university to study a course that would eventually put me on the right track of this desire that I so long for since my youth. However to my surprise, I was wrong, very wrong about it all and what I never thought of doing in my life, not even for a second is exactly where I was thrown- by God.

My purpose is to educate! I am a teacher! I never wanted to be a teacher, I wanted to become a world class physician. I thought it was my purpose, the reason for my creation. I ate, slept, and breathe anything that would move me in the direction of becoming an awesome physician not knowing that I was journeying on a path that wasn’t my own. So I was thrown into teaching and I fought it for years. My first year was miserable only because I didn’t have an open mind nor did I think that I was called to be an educator. It wasn’t until my 4th year of teaching that I discovered that this was something that I didn’t mind doing actually and that I did very much enjoy it and not until my 7th year did I fully know that this was my purpose.

Discovering your purpose in life is crucial if you desire to live a happy, healthy and fulfilled life. I want to share 5 reasons why knowing/discovering your purpose saves you so much time (and money) in life.

WHEN YOU KNOW YOUR PURPOSE YOU THINK MORE CLEARLY

When you are unsure of the path to take in life everything will look fuzzy and hazy to you. You will think that you are doing the correct thing meanwhile you are not. This was me for years- I thought becoming a physician was what I was made for. It wasn’t until I was thrown into the field of teaching that I not only discovered that I wasn’t seeing clearly about my life but that indeed this was my purpose. When I eventually made that discovery, I was able to think so much more clearly, way more than the 7- 8 years that I was constantly thinking of many ways to become a physician. I didn’t have “foggy mind” syndrome any more because it was all so clear to me. I could see the potential of my growth while I was teaching because I no longer focused on what was not mine in the first place.Desire to think and see your purpose more clearly.

YOU BECOME MUCH MORE HAPPIER

I have to admit, when I didn’t know my purpose I was so unhappy. It was some of the darkest times of my life because I was pursuing something that wasn’t for me at all. I was confused as to why it was so hard for me. I was putting an insane amount of pressure on myself. I was sad that I felt like I was being left behind. I felt like a complete and total failure and disappointment. I was just bad and sad for me. However, the moment in which I slowing began to see that my calling and purpose was indeed to become a teacher so that I could later in life fulfill what God was calling me to do I found a new sense of peace and happiness. Ever since my discovery, I’ve been so happy about my calling, my purpose, my destiny. I wake up every morning with a smile knowing that I am able to teach my students something new that day. I love standing in front of students who are eager to learn and teach them all I know and I derive such great happiness and joy in knowing that I am able to shape the minds of the next generation.Do something that will make you happy!

YOU SAVE TONS OF MONEY

When you are unsure of what you are meant to do in life, it can be quite costly. I mean it is EXPENSIVE. I can tell you that I’ve spent hundreds of thousands of dollars pursuing a field that was not for me. It’s not fun to spend money where you don’t need to spend money. Everyone loves to save when and where they can. Knowing your purpose saves you tons of money.Don’t waste money on something you are not sure is for you.

IT TAKES YOU INTO YOUR DESTINY, EARLY!

For years, I thought I was going in the right direction to my destiny but I am so grateful that God re-routed me in the correct direction. Imagine driving on the highway without a GPS or navigation system to a location you’ve never been to in your life. Let’s say you were to exit on exit 5 but you kept driving to exit 50 only to discover that your exit was exit 5. How you would you feel? Bothered and annoyed I’m sure! That’s exactly what happens when we don’t know our purpose in life. We keep walking and pursuing other things aimlessly. Sometimes we have jobs that are giving us a temporary financial benefit and we stay the course for years only to be honest with ourselves after serving that company for 30 years of our life unfulfilled. When you know your purpose it takes you to your destiny, your exit quicker. You begin to operate in your destiny way quicker than if you had to wait for 30 years.Desire to get there without any delays.

YOU FEEL ACCOMPLISHED

When you know your purpose you will feel accomplished. Although your purpose will evolve as you grow and mature in life, you will have a sense of accomplishment when you are truly walking in your purpose. It can be super dreadful to be walking a path that is not meant for you. I constantly tell people especially my students that the one thing that you don’t want to do in life is to be walking on the wrong path and discover it when it’s too late. The only way that you will be accomplished is if you open yourself up to actively pursuing your purpose in life.Desire to discover your purpose today if you want to feel accomplished in life.

"SYNOPSIS: The movie consists of a conversation between Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn, both of whom were active in New York theater at the time of the movie. Two themes tie the entire dialog together: (1) should we live spontaneously in the moment, disconnecting ourselves from the purposes of our actions (a la Hindu Karma Yoga), and (2) what is the purpose of the theater. Andre answers yes to the first question and argues that experimental theater can help facilitate this. Wally answers no to the first question and argues that theater has the more modest task of awakening us to new views and issues. In spite of the movie’s dialogically-driven format, it nevertheless follows the standard three-act formula of movie making (i.e., beginning, middle, and end). In Act 1, Wally displays reluctance to meet with Andre, thus creating the tension that is carried throughout the film. For about a half hour, Andre, with brilliant story-telling ability, describes his quests around the world in an attempt to find meaning. In Act 2, Andre defends his philosophy of life (point 1 above), while Wally uncomfortably listens and politely even concedes some points. In Act 3, Wally reveals his true opinion of Andre’s views and, defending common sense, hammers away at Andre’s notions of purposeless action, outposts of enlightenment, and the supernatural. Andre listens graciously to the attack. Both leave the dinner unconvinced of the others’ views, but rewarded by the debate. Like philosophy itself, this movie is for selective audiences, which the filmmakers themselves clearly understood. The format of “My Dinner with Andre” has influenced two other philosophical movies. In “The Quarrel” (1991), a conservative and a liberal Jew discuss the moral implications of the Nazi Holocaust. In “Mind Walk” (1991), a poet, politician and physicist discuss the relation between quantum physics and environmentalism.

The specific stories and issues discussed in the film are as follows: Polish theatre director Gratovsky who organizes 40 people in a forest retreat and 100 people in the “bee hive”; the Little Prince; Japanese Buddhist monk Kozan who goes with Andre to the Sahara desert and later lives with Andre and family; the flag; the Scottish agricultural community; Halloween on Long Island; awareness that he is an intellectual creep; people not saying what they’re really feeling but simply play roles; breaking life’s habits and experiencing each moment anew; needing extraordinary experiences to get in touch with reality; contemporary culture turning us into robots and the need to create new centers to preserve life; science vs. the supernatural; perceiving death.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:

1. Andre describes hallucinations that he had, which, from the perspective of an impartial observer, suggest that he was schizophrenic. Does his intellectualism and association with the theatre legitimize his hallucinatory experiences – more so than if, for example, an accountant had similar hallucinations?

2. Although we might explain away Andre’s experiences as the product of schizophrenia, what are we to make of all the people who went through the same experiences with him – e.g., the Polish theatre group, Gratovsky, Kozan?

3. Now rejecting his extreme adventures, Andre compares himself to Nazi architect Albert Speer, a cultured man who didn’t think that ordinary rules of life applied to him. Is anything about this comparison appropriate?

4. According to Andre, Gratovsky gave up the theatre since he felt that people were performing so well in their lives that the theatre was superfluous. Do we really perform in our daily lives in the way that actors perform on the stage? If so, then why do most people seem so unnatural when they attempt to perform on stage?

5. Andre describes a Scottish mathematician who would attempt to “break the habits of living” through a series of exercises, such as doing things with his left hand rather than his right. This would force him to learn things. What are the benefits and disbenefits of breaking such habits of living?

6. The electric blanket: Wally finds it to be an important creature comfort, but Andre believes that it separates us from reality; that is, like a lobotomy, comfort can lull us into a dangerous tranquility. Who’s right?

7. Andre discusses Martin Buber’s book “On Hadism” which describes the Hasidic view that there are spirits chained in everything, and prayer is the act of liberating them. Each moment of our lives, then, should be a kind of prayerful sacrament. Wally, by contrast, states that he has to block out large sections of the real world – such as people starving in Africa – in order to be happy. Who’s right?

8. Wally believes that serious plays about human alienation may make people aware of reality. Andre believes that such serious plays do more harm than good by only reinforcing the views of alienation that people already have. Theatre, he believes, should be eye-opening, like some of his experiences with the Theatre group in Poland. What’s the purpose of theatre?

10. Wally asks whether we need an extraordinary experience such as a trip to Mount Everest in order to perceive reality. Is there any kind of literature or theatre that can do this without taking a dramatic trip?

11. Wally states near the end of the film that in the normal world of jobs, bills, and other responsibilities, there’s no need for the awareness-outposts that Andre describes. Happiness can be achieved within our routine. Is Wally correct, or is he just a content robot?

12. Wally attempts to debunk Andre’s various supernatural experiences in favor of scientific explanations. Andre asks what’s the difference if all facts are meaningless. Wally responds, “The meaningless fact of the fortune cookie or the turtles egg can’t possibly have any relevance to the subject you’re analyzing. Whereas a group of meaningless facts that are collected and interpreted in a scientific way might quite possibly be relevant, because the wonderful thing about scientific theories of things is that they are based on experiments that can be repeated.” Is Wally correct in his rejection of the supernatural?

13. Andre states that science has been held up as a magical force that will solve everything, when in fact it has destroyed everything, thus making it necessary to create awareness outposts. To what extent might science be responsible for the modern alienation that Andre describes?

14. Wally states his fundamental objection to Andre’s strange adventures: Andre and those he was with attempted to strip purpose away from all activity in an attempt to experience pure being. But, according to Wally, it is our nature to do things with purpose. Andre responds that we can do all sorts of things but still be completely dead inside. Can these two views be reconciled?

REVIEWS

My Dinner with Andre strikes me as a film which many wish to have seen, but few wish to see. Though I understand full well that, like philosophy itself, the film is meant for ""selective audiences,"" and though I love philosophy, I simply could not bring myself to become engaged in the film. It is, to be blunt, about 30 minutes of interesting dialogue packed into a 110-minute film. Most of the film consists of Andre's blabbering forth syrupy pop-spirituality, which is meant to be legitimized somehow by his connection to the theatre community. Though Andre occasionally makes a good point, he consistently does so in the same annoying, patronizing manner, in which he treats Wally – who for most of the film plays the part of the audience – as though he were some poor simpleton who has never had the privilege of Andre's hippie-dippy enlightenment camps. By the third act, Wally finally begins to speak up and offers some criticisms of Andre's views; though I understand the purpose of the mounting tension released at this point, Wally simply did not offer enough bite in his replies to be satisfactory. In particular, I was most bothered by Andre's repeated (usually implied) insistence that his whacky adventures are necessary to get in touch with reality. As the film uses Wally as the audience's on-screen counterpart, I was thoroughly disappointed when he did not slap Andre in the face and inform him that all he has accomplished is getting in touch with whacky adventures, and thus has set himself up for precisely the same sort of alienation which he so thoroughly laments. -- Frezno Smooth

I would not recommend this movie, unless the philosophical issues of finding a persons purpose in life was worth watching a hour and half two guy chatting. The movie made some nice and interesting points. However, the movie was too long, a little boring, and the meaning of the movie was hard to pinpoint. Watching one person chat for 45 minutes in a motion picture is not my impression of entertaining. The philosophical issues of knowing ones purpose in life was interesting; however, the movie could have been shortened to half an hour, no more. The meaning of life and the pursuit of what it means to you is a worthy philosophical issue for a movie, and the way that Andre wanted to find his true self in the world was a rightful challenge. However, Andre picked an expensive restaurant, and the way he acted towards the waiter shows the true nature of a rich person not an individual. -- Ubermensch

This went on a little long. A lot of interesting concepts were touched on, and largely the movie served as a comparison between two lifestyles. Andre is an eccentric and a traveler, and Wallace is more of a settled type. Andre believes and argues that life should be lived in a spontaneous fashion, and that comforts that make one too sedentary should be discarded. Wallace seems to mostly be a background character throughout the film, asking questions to prompt Andre, and responding to his largely rhetorical questions. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not going to say the dialogue was boring. It wasn’t. There were numerous wonderful little tidbits of thought and ideas ripe for exploration. Andre Gregory seems like a terribly interesting guy. The problem here is one of choosing an appropriate medium. Visual mediums like painting, theater, and cinema, are best used when something is worth looking at. This production could have benefited enormously if, before anyone started wasting film or location scouting budgets, Andre Gregory would have said to himself, “Ya know what? Screw a movie, I’m just gonna write this stuff down. Maybe an essay or a short story.” As a text, I wouldn’t have been able to put this down. As a film, I had to continuously rock myself back and fourth in the little booth in the media center to keep my attention on the screen. I do not have ADD, but this film made me feel like it. The fact that they even credited someone as directing it stuck me as pretty bizarre. -- Reviewer from Hell",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The Samsung GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus has been officially announced, which brings yet another Honeycomb-flavored tablet to the scene. What we are dealing with is a device meant to be a successor to the original 7-inch GALAXY Tab, which debuted about a year ago, and standing a tad below the recently unveiled Samsung GALAXY Tab 7.7 in terms of specs.

Just like the very first GALAXY Tab, the 7.0 Plus sports a 7-inch touchscreen display with 1024 by 600 pixels of resolution. This time, however, the display is of the PLS type, which should translate into superior viewing angles and a 10% boost in brightness when compared to IPS LCDs. The Samsung GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus is also lighter and slimmer than its predecessor tipping the scales at 12.16 ounces (345 grams) and boasting a waistline of 0.39 inches (9.96 millimeters).

What provides the GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus with processing power is a 1.2GHz dual-core chip accompanied by a gig of RAM. That should be enough processing punch to allow for 1080p HD video to play back smoothly. The tablet is also equipped with a 2-megapixel front-facing camera for video chats and a 3-megapixel main one capable of recording 720p footage.

In terms of software, the Samsung GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus will come with Android 3.2 Honeycomb out of the box. Of course, Samsung's very own TouchWiz interface will be installed on top of it along with a bunch of handy apps provided by the company, namely Social Hub, Readers Hub, and Music Hub. Last but not least, the tablet will be equipped with a 21Mbps HSPA+ radio meaning that you will be able to stay connected to the web even when on the move.

Although folks in Indonesia and Austria will be the first ones to get a taste of the Samsung GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus, which will happen by the end of October, the tablet is expected to become available in the US eventually. It will also be sold across Europe, Latin America, Southeast and Southwest Asia, CIS, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Japan and China.

source: Samsung

UPDATE: Our eagle-eyed readers have pointed out that the Samsung GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus has a dialer icon on its home screen, which is a clear indication that it will be able to make phone calls like the old-school GALAXY Tab could. There also appears to be an earpiece above its display.

“Samsung pioneered the seven-inch tablet market with the launch of the GALAXY Tab, marking an innovation milestone in the mobile industry. Building on the success of the GALAXY Tab, we’re now delighted to introduce the GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus reloaded with enhanced portability, productivity and a richer multimedia experience” said JK Shin, President and Head of Samsung’s Mobile Communications Business. He added “GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus is for those who want to stay productive and in touch with work, friends and content anytime, anywhere.”

Enhanced Portability

With 7-inch display, GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus provides enhanced portability, weighing just 345g and measuring at just 9.96mm thin. Enhanced portability ensures that it fits easily into an inside-jacket pocket or a handbag, making it an ideal device for those who need to stay productive and entertained while on-the-move.

Advanced Productivity

GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus delivers a smooth and intuitive user experience with powerful performance powered by 1.2GHz dual core processor. Mini Apps allows seamless multitasking by consolidating 7 applications easily accessed from a bottom-side tray on main screen. Users can launch favorite features such as music player or calendar as pop-ups over full screen applications. Not only that, users can design an individualized up-to-the-minute interface through Live Panel.

Web browsing is also enhanced by Adobe Flash and super-fast HSPA+ connectivity, providing download speeds up to three times faster than a conventional HSPA connection. On top of that Wi-Fi Channel Bonding bonds two channels into one for improved network connection and data transfer at up to twice the speed.

Furthermore, the GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus offers voice and video call support, with no need for a headset.

Users can see friends and family from anywhere in the world in high quality thanks to the device’s larger screen.

Rich Multimedia on-the-move

Full HD videos can be enjoyed on the 7-inch WSVGA PLS display, with DivX & multi codec support ensuring the device is capable of supporting a variety of different formats. An improved virtual clipboard, which stores text and images enabling easy copy and paste, further adds to these capabilities.

Additionally, the GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus features Social Hub, Readers Hub and Music Hub services. Social Hub aggregates the user’s contacts, calendar and email along with instant messaging and social networking connections all within one easy-to-use interface. Readers Hub provides e-reading content such as e-books, newspapers and magazines. Music Hub enables access to over 13 million songs even when out and about.

GALAXY Tab 7.0 Plus will be available starting in Indonesia and Austria from end-October and gradually rolled out globally including Southeast and Southwest Asia, US, Europe, CIS, Latin America, Middle East, Africa, Japan and China.

"Honduras's Azcona: proud, conservative, and maybe surprising

Tegucigalpa, Honduras
— The man who almost certainly will be the next president of Honduras looks like the portrait of a 19th-century Central American statesman come to life. Tall, haughty, with a full head of straight, white hair brushed back from a wide expanse of forehead, Jos'e Azcona Hoyo, seems nothing if not presidential. A reputation for scrupulous financial integrity and a traditionally conservative ideology combined with an equally traditional concern for the poor, complete the idealized picture of a Latin founding father.

And yet, surprisingly, this man aroused some apprehension before the elections among right-wing groups in the oligarchy, Army, and United States government.

Mr. Azcona was distrusted in part because of his well-known pride, which his enemies call arrogance, and inflexibility, which many analysts here believe could make him a less reliable executor of US policies than the outgoing Honduran administration.

Azcona will be weakened in carrying out his programs, because he received only 30 percent of the popular vote and a minority of seats in the National Assembly. His main opponent, Liberal Party candidate Rafael Leonardo Callejas, won 40 percent of the vote. The electoral system provides that the leading candidate of the party with the most votes wins. Azcona's victory will probably be challenged in court by opposition leaders.

Outgoing President Roberto Suazo C'ordova has been widely perceived here as complying completely with US wishes to turn Honduras into a base from which US-backed Nicaraguan rebels, known as ``contras,'' launch attacks on neighboring Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government. There is a strong US military presence in Honduras. The US has held military maneuvers here and has a large number of US troops in Palmerola.

Ultraconservatives distrust the group of advisers around Azcona, a group that covers a surprisingly broad gamut, ranging from traditional Liberal Party politicians to bankers who consider themselves socially progressive, to former Marxists rapidly moving to the right.

Extensive interviews with several of Azcona's top advisers make it clear that many important groups around the Honduran leader favor policies that the US opposes. But, given Honduras's extreme economic and military dependence on the US and the mixed nature of the group around Azcona, the big question is: To what extent will these controversial policies prevail?

The policies are based on:

The withdrawal of the contras from Honduras.

The strong opposition to the fiscal policy of devaluing the Honduran currency, the lempira. The policy is advocated by the US and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for third world countries struggling to pay back large foreign debts.

Several sources close to Azcona say neither the future president, who assumes office in January, nor most of his advisers are happy with the presence of the contras in Honduras. They feel uncomfortable with a foreign military presence that may grow to be as large as the Honduran armed services, which has roughly 22,000 troops. They also fear that the US might eventually back away from an unsuccessful contra policy, leaving Honduras stuck with the armed Nicaraguan exiles in its territory.

The problem, says a key Azcona adviser, is: ``How do we get rid of the contras without getting rid of US aid?''

Although the US shows no signs of budging from its insistence that Honduras serve as a contra base, some Liberal Party sources speculate that in a year or so, after finding that the contras are no closer to overthrowing the Sandinistas than they are now, the US might be willing to strike a deal. Such a deal, say these sources, might be the possible establishment of an official US naval base in the Honduran port town of Puerto Castilla, in exchange for the withdrawal of the contras. Other Liberal Party M DBRleaders believe that it is unrealistic to expect such a deal.

The chances that Azcona's economic policy will be somewhat independent of US dictates are greater than those of the outgoing administration. Washington and the IMF argue that devaluation makes a country's goods cheaper and thus easier to sell abroad.

But in a country that has little to export except bananas, devaluation is no panacea, say Honduran opponents of devaluation. Instead, devaluation leads to an endless round of inflation and further devaluation, says Azcona adviser Jaime Rosenthal.

Mr. Rosenthal is a leader of the Alipo faction. He says devaluation is inflationary, because much of the basic foodstuffs and mass industrial goods consumed in Honduras are imported. When their prices go up, wages must rise. Fears of further devaluation cause investors to keep their money in dollars and send it out of the country. The more liberal Alipo faction is expected to have a strong voice in Azcona's economic policies, as Alipo leader Jorge Bue-sos Arias will be Treasury Minister.

Those around Azcona want Hon-duras's foreign debt to be renegotiated with better terms of repayment and lower interest rates. The problem can be solved eventually, within the context of Latin American solidarity, they say.

Two other key politicians outside Alipo are close to Azcona. Jorge Madariaga, a young lawyer whose policies are slightly to the left of Alipo, and Carlos Montoya, a former Marxist who has become considerably more conservative. Political observers here see a potential power struggle developing between the two men.

Most analysts here say that, apart from some leftovers from the Liberal Party old guard, Azcona and his advisers will be more honest and efficient than the outgoing administration.

Azcona's group wants mass employment policies and to bring the stalled land-reform program back to life. Many analysts here doubt that the group will be able to carry out the kind of massive social change necessary to lift most Hondurans out of poverty.

``I don't think Azcona can make a big difference, because I don't think he can make deep structural changes here. Unfortunately, I believe that the groups behind the status quo, around him, in the Liberal Party, in the Army, and in the oligarchy will prevail,'' a foreigner working here in development projects says.

In an article on Honduras in Monday's Monitor, Rafael Leonardo Callejas was incorrectly identified as the presidential candidate of the Liberal Party. He was the National Party candidate.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Do We Remember: ‘We Have Had Our Fall’

My first meaningful encounters with Mencken’s work came while we were in Dayton. Mencken approached his coverage of the Scopes Trial — and Dayton and its people — with the same quick-witted ferocity he was famous for.

In reading over his attacks of the South in Ralph C. Wood’s Flannery O’Connor and the Christ-Haunted South, though, I realized something: many of the arguments he made against the South, its critics still make today. As Wood quotes him:

Down there a poet is now almost as rare as an oboe player, a dry-point etcher of a metaphysician. It is, indeed, amazing to contemplate so vast a vacuity. . . . Nearly the whole of Europe could be lost in that stupendous region of fat farms, shoddy cities and paralyzed cerebrums. . . . And yet, for all its size and and all its wealth and all the ‘progress’ it babbles of, it is almost as sterile, artistically, intellectually, culturally, as the Sahara Desert.

And with Mencken’s attacks came the rise of the Agrarians — that class of Southern writers who resisted Mencken’s arguments and defended the South, warts and all, as a distinct and true region.

Wood points out that Flannery O’Connor took Mencken seriously at one particular point that the Agrarians may not have: Mencken’s recognition of fundamentalist Christianity as the lynchpin that held so much of the South together. Hence the double-edged nature of O’Connor’s fiction.

Wood gets into all those issues and weaves together, really, a masterful account, nuanced as the issues are in reality. If you’re interested, I encourage you to pick his book up.

But here’s the thing that nags me now: Mencken and others backed up their claims with sociological data that was hard to refute on its face. The Southern defenders’ best argument was that the “fixes” Northerners would have Southerners undertake burn away the South’s identity and render it like every other part of the country: indistinct.

Faced with many of the same sociological problems today (see, for example, lots of the data at www.datacenter.kidscount.org), does the South still possess its distinctiveness? Do we Southerners know today what makes us Southern?

Courtesy Kids Count Data Center

The cynic here would offer a caricature of Kim Davis and say that the South is as backwards as it ever has been, and as backwards as Mencken described it, save for the addition of “gay-hating” and “gun-toting” to the long list of adjectives.

The Agrarian defenders, in countering Mencken and others, pointed out the South’s penchant for politeness and manners, its honor code that rewarded moral behavior, its work ethic that in many cases was actually color blind. Many of them acknowledged the fact that the South’s loss in the Civil War instilled in its people a loss of innocence and understanding of reality. Wood says:

With its humiliating defeat in defense of an indefensible cause, the South acquired an ineradicable sense of the tragic: the awareness that even the best of cultures can go profoundly wrong, that seeming good can be built on massive evil, that many things broken cannot be mended, and that much evil must patiently be endured.

In O’Connor’s words, “We have had our fall.” Arguably until the Vietnam War or 9/11, no other pocket of the country knew of such.

My question: outside of a deceptive sentimentalism, do we today in the South still have this identity?

Perhaps this has always been true, but my sense of this is that very few have any clue of this identity, and few care to. In the rural areas, such as where I live, a remnant sense of identity — based as much in local communities as in the South itself — still clings to the hills and fields. My county, Greene County, was once one of the biggest producers of Burley tobacco in the South. Until his dying days right after I joined the staff, my newspaper’s much-loved columnist, Bob Hurley, still wrote of the smells that filled downtown Greeneville in December, when tobacco was put to market in the huge warehouses that peppered town.

But it wasn’t just the tobacco and its smell: it was the community’s recognition that it was very much a lifeblood of the local economy, and the work it took to harvest it kept families working together in the fields.

East Tennessee, thanks to its mountainous terrain and lack of plantations, was home to Union sympathizers. Our side of the state voted against secession. Greeneville was the home of Andrew Johnson, perhaps the most misunderstood and most scorned scorned son of the South.

A few weeks ago I helped interview two locals who attended Greeneville’s black high school before school integration in 1965. Here in Greeneville, there were virtually no issues when blacks began sitting in classrooms with whites. No protests, no fights, no scenes of police officers wielding fire hoses, or anything of the sort. When I asked these two people why that was — what made Greene County so different — they answered almost immediately that everyone was so poor — especially out in the county — and used to working, living, and playing with each other, no one harbored any ill will.

Memories like this are becoming scant, I fear. But these memories exist here (and I’m proud that stories like this are how I can help keep these memories alive).

Growing up in suburbia outside Chattanooga, I never heard much of who we Southerners were, outside of my father’s love of history. As Chattanooga has grown and finds itself as an up-and-coming locale for hipsters, Millennials, and anyone wanting a taste of the New South, I wonder if the values the Agrarians offered as rebuttals to Mencken resonate with folks there.

Do we still possess the virtues of the Old South?

The Southern writers of the early and mid-20th century had sturdy ground on which to stand when defending Southern virtues.

Do we today?

Elsewhere in his book, Wood points out that O’Connor, in her devout Catholicism, saw the importance of the sacraments in her theology. And her fiction. Those sacraments illustrate the length to which God sought His people — using the crude stuff He Himself fashioned in brining forgiveness and redemption, and they stand in stark opposition to the sort of gnosticism that hyper-spiritualized, fundamentalist Protestantism brought. The idea that one could be “so heavenly minded that he is no earthly good” is in part an indictment of the kind of fundamentalism that shuns enjoyment of the physical — intended for enjoyment, when regarded and used correctly —and supplants it with a pharisaical bent toward the judgmental.

I wonder if this fundamentalist gnosticism leads to the directionless poverty typified by the family Dylan Roof stayed with before killing nine black people in a church in Charleston. This fundamentalism no doubt has some Southern roots, but its effect is to divorce us from the tradition of hard work and genuine care for the well-being of others. And it grows like kudzu, creating a Southern void.

I’m aware some people reading this may not buy anything I have said that puts the South or Southerners in any kind of redeemable light. But I wholeheartedly believe that is a product of cynicism, formed by an almost nihilistic incivility. And I hope if any discussion starts here, we will steer clear of it.

One thought on “Do We Remember: ‘We Have Had Our Fall’”

Wonderful essay, Michael. I’m glad you agonize over these things; for some of us, they are important. The South is Flannery O’Connor’s Catholicism and Tennessee Williams’s whiskey-soaked Big Daddy (not to omit Brick, his closeted gay son). As the old folks depart this life, things do change. And, I must even admit that some of our elders have amended their ways without the Grim Reaper at their door. With their passing, holdovers of prejudice and bigotry leave, but so does some of the grace and gentility — as if to affirm that this region has always been a schizophrenic’s paradise. “Too heavenly minded to be any earthly good” only scratches the surface of our profound and cherished contradictions. To whit, that “gay-hating” thing is really too bad, but quite logical, as I have long speculated that the majority of gay men in the south are married to women. Mencken may have “hated the south,” but I think he must also have been grateful for its alien ways which presented him (on a rusty Ford hubcap) the imperative to exercise his formidable acerbity. I will definitely read Ralph Woods’s book.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Neon Therapeutics Files for $100 Million IPO for Immuno-Oncology Pipeline

Neon Therapeutics (Proposed Nasdaq: NTGN) has filed for a $100 million initial public offering to fund clinical development of its neoantigen program. Neoantigens result from mutations occurring during tumor growth, are recognized as foreign and differ from native antigens to which the immune system is tolerant. The presence of neoantigens in cancer cells and their absence in normal cells makes them compelling, untapped targets for cancer therapy.

The company launched in 2015 with a $55 million Series A investment led by Third Rock Ventures with participation from Clal Biotechnology Industries and Access Industries. The $106 million Series B round in 2017 was led by Partner Fund Management and joined by Third Rock and Access, along with new investors Fidelity, Wellington, Inbio Ventures, Nextech Invest, Pharmstandard International, Arrowmark Partners, Hillhouse Capital and Casdin Capital. The IPO will be led by Morgan Stanley, BofA Merrill Lynch and Mizuho Securities.

Neon is developing a pipeline of personalized neoantigen vaccines and autologous T cell therapies, with an initial focus on melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and bladder cancer. The company has collaboration and licensing agreements in place with Vedantra Pharmaceuticals, Apexigen, CRISPR Therapeutics, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, the Broad Institute, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Massachusetts General Hospital.

Source: Neon Therapeutics

In May 2018, Neon announced that it had treated its first patient in a Phase I clinical trial evaluating its proprietary personal neoantigen vaccine, NEO-PV-01, in combination with Merck’s Keytruda (anti PD-1 therapy) and a chemotherapy regimen of pemetrexed and carboplatin in patients with untreated or advanced metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with Merck. In addition to evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination therapy, the trial will assess neoantigen-specific immune responses in peripheral blood and tumor tissue, and other markers of immune response.

Treating our first patient in this clinical study marks an important milestone for Neon. We see a strong mechanistic rationale to explore the combination and sequence of a personal neoantigen cancer vaccine, anti-PD-1 therapy and chemotherapy. These data will help us understand the potential of NEO-PV-01 to improve durability and response rates of patients treated in combination with existing immuno-oncology drugs.

Beneficiaries' rights to trust information

Barbara Gardener

Bio:

Recently we looked at a novel way some trust beneficiaries had sought to obtain information from the trustees, using the Data Protection Act.

We also mentioned a recent case which was decided since this topic was last considered in these articles in 2015. This month we consider this case in more detail and we will also set out the key rules on what the rights of beneficiaries and corresponding obligations of trustees are in this respect.

The right to see trust accounts

The case in question was RNLI and others v Headley and McCole [2016] EWHC 1948 (Ch).

The facts of the case

Mrs Farmer died in 1996 and her Will created two life interests for adult beneficiaries – her son and daughter-in-law, with up to ten named charities benefitting in remainder.

The Will nominated as executors John Headley and Kevin McCole, both solicitors at the law firm Headleys. The estate was worth about £145,000.

One of the life tenants is still alive, so the charities' interests have not yet fallen into possession.

Over the years the charities made numerous requests for information about the trust and a set of provisional accounts was sent to some of them in 2007, but that was the last they ever heard from the firm for many years.

In 2014, five of the charities instructed a firm of solicitors to act for them and they in turn managed to contact Headleys by phone, but did not receive the information they sought.

After several more requests for information the charities issued proceedings against the trustees. As it turned out, one of the trustees had previously died so the case was against the surviving co-trustee, McCole, who in the event failed to appear or present a defence, so the judge had to consider the case on the claimants’ evidence.

The argument and the decision

The charities argued, apparently quoting the 1998 case of Armitage v Nurse, that 'Every beneficiary is entitled to see the trust accounts, whether his interest is in possession or not.' They also quoted Schmidt v Rosewood Trust to assert that trust accounts and other documents must be disclosed to all beneficiaries on demand, save in exceptional circumstances.

Needless to say nothing is quite so straightforward. We previously considered the 2003 decision by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Schmidt -v- Rosewood Trust Ltd (2003) WLR565 back in 2015.

Briefly, the judges in that case decided that it was within the Court’s discretion to decide whether a beneficiary with only a remote or defeasible interest had any rights to see documents at all and, if so, then what classes of document should be disclosed, either completely or in a redacted form; and what safeguards should be imposed to limit the use which might be made of the documents or information disclosed under the order of the Court.

In the present case the judge did not accept the charities’ claims in their entirety, preferring the view that disclosure must depend on 'what is needed in the circumstances for the beneficiaries to appreciate, verify and if need be vindicate their own rights against the trustees in respect of the administration of the trust' which will vary according to the facts of the case.

The judge noted that the charities ' remainder interest had not yet crystallised and therefore they had no basis to demand information about trust income that was payable to the life tenant.

However, he agreed that the charities did have a right to see accounts of capital, lists of investments and a breakdown of trustees' fees and expenditure in as far as the trustees have deducted these sums from trust capital.

Finding the trustees to be in breach of duty, the judge made an order requiring these accounts to be disclosed to the charities. He also ordered the surviving trustee to pay the claimant charities' costs, approximately £8,000, in full, without the right to claim them back from the trust estate.

The decision is therefore also a warning to trustees that they may end up being personally liable for failing to provide the requested information.

So where does that leave us?

The implications for trustees and beneficiaries.

Here are some key points to bear in mind whether you are a trustee or a beneficiary.

Beneficiaries with fixed rights under a trust have more rights to information than those under discretionary trusts.

Certain beneficiaries must be provided with information as of right – e.g. a life tenant about the trust income they are entitled to. A life tenant under a qualifying interest in possession trust must be told about the value of the trust estate that falls into their estate for IHT purposes.

Beneficiaries with fixed or contingent but defined rights (e.g. entitlement to capital at certain age or following the death of a life tenant) have a right to know that a trust exists and what their interests are.

Generally speaking the trust document and other documents appointing/retiring trustees or changing/adding assets are disclosable to a beneficiary. However, if the right of a particular individual depends solely on the trustees´ discretion, there may be no right to receive any information until the person in question becomes a “real potential” beneficiary.

Generally the trust accounts are also disclosable to a beneficiary but access may be restricted depending on the nature of the beneficiary’s interest. As shown in the above case a trustee is only obliged to provide the information needed by the particular beneficiary to appreciate their own rights against the trustee in respect of the administration of the trust; it is not necessary to go beyond this.

Other documents, such as the settlor’s letter of wishes in relation to the trust, documents about the exercise of powers and discretions, and legal advice obtained by the trustees, generally need not be disclosed.

If trustees receive a request for information from a beneficiary, they need to consider it carefully and only refuse a request if they are certain that this is in their power, bearing in mind that a beneficiary may apply to the Court and the trustees may find themselves personally liable for any costs. If in doubt the trustees may also apply to the Court for direction.

COMMENT

Some further clarification of what information and which beneficiaries are entitled to it is welcome as well as the warning to trustees to take beneficiaries’ requests seriously.

It has been noted in recent years that there has been an increase in litigation brought by charities; indeed some have been criticised for being too aggressive. A potential action by a remainder beneficiary, be it a charity or not, is something to consider by any person making a Will or indeed a lifetime trust. A letter of wishes from the testator/settlor will always be an extremely useful tool for the trustees to use. Another issue is the form of Will drafting where charities are to benefit, with some, supposedly simple, provisions causing all kinds of problems. This is something we will look at next month.

"Fools' Gold Found to Regulate Oxygen

Jul 23, 2012

As sulfur cycles through Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land, it undergoes chemical changes that are often coupled to changes in other such elements as carbon and oxygen. Although this affects the concentration of free oxygen, sulfur has traditionally been portrayed as a secondary factor in regulating atmospheric oxygen, with most of the heavy lifting done by carbon. However, new findings that appeared this week in Science suggest that sulfur's role may have been underestimated.

Drs. Itay Halevy of the Weizmann Institute's Environmental Science and Energy Research Department (Faculty of Chemistry), Shanan Peters of the University of Wisconsin and Woodward Fischer of the California Institute of Technology, were interested in better understanding the global sulfur cycle over the last 550 million years – roughly the period in which oxygen has been at its present atmospheric level of around 20%. They used a database developed and maintained by Peters at the University of Wisconsin, called Macrostrat, which contains detailed information on thousands of rock units in North America and beyond.

The researchers used the database to trace one of the ways in which sulfur exits ocean water into the underlying sediments – the formation of so-called sulfate evaporite minerals. These sulfur-bearing minerals, such as gypsum, settle to the bottom of shallow seas as seawater evaporates. The team found that the formation and burial of sulfate evaporites were highly variable over the last 550 million years, due to changes in shallow sea area, the latitude of ancient continents and sea level. More surprising to Halevy and colleagues was the discovery that only a relatively small fraction of the sulfur cycling through the oceans has exited seawater in this way. Their research showed that the formation and burial of a second sulfur-bearing mineral – pyrite – has apparently been much more important. Pyrite is an iron-sulfur mineral (also known as fools' gold), which forms when microbes in seafloor sediments use the sulfur dissolved in seawater to digest organic matter. The microbes take up sulfur in the form of sulfate (bound to four oxygen atoms) and release it as sulfide (with no oxygen). Oxygen is released during this process, thus making it a source of oxygen in the air. But because this part of the sulfur cycle was thought be minor in comparison to sulfate evaporite burial, (which does not release oxygen) its effect on oxygen levels was also thought to be unimportant.

In testing various theoretical models of the sulfur cycle against the Macrostrat data, the team realized that the production and burial of pyrite has been much more significant than previously thought, accounting for more than 80% of all sulfur removed from the ocean (rather than the 30-40% in prior estimates). As opposed to the variability they saw for sulfate evaporite burial, pyrite burial has been relatively stable throughout the period. The analysis also revealed that most of the sulfur entering the ocean washed in from the weathering of pyrite exposed on land. In other words, there is a balance between pyrite formation and burial, which releases oxygen, and the weathering of pyrite on land, which consumes it. The implication of these findings is that the sulfur cycle regulates the atmospheric concentration of oxygen more strongly than previously appreciated.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

In Which Adam Spends Too Much Time and Energy Pondering Over What Having Stretchy Powers Entails Wednesday!

Along with the yellow oval underneath Batman's chest emblem, we started getting Elongated Man as a back-up story. While I have nothing against J'Onn J'Onzz or Roy Raymond, TV Detective, I found Ralph and Sue Dibny's stories a lot more entertaining.

And hey! Why not start the day with some Fun with Out of Context Dialogue?(tm!):

Over the years, Ralph's powers were a little undefined, depending on who wrote the story. But basically, Ralph was only supposed to be able stretch. Thusly:

Personally, I can wiggle my ears, but it kind of freaks me out that Ralph was able to use his nose as an appendage. I mean, no matter how large my nose became, I don't think I would have the muscular control to wrap it around a pistol like that. I think the fact that he's referring to his nose as an ""elephant's trunk"" is our clue that the writer over-stepped Ralph's abilities to stretch.

And there's also this:

This kind of makes more sense to me, because the muscles in your arms make smacking someone with your elbow an easy thing to do.

So while I question that stretching gives you the ability to use your nose as an eleventh finger, things like smacking someone with an outstretched arm, leg, elbow, knee, etc. made perfect sense.

This, however, confuses me:

Stretching does not equal giganticism. Ralph is not Plastic Man, who could actually change his shape. Ralph stretches, the end. Is anyone of the opinion that you could actually stretch your hand and make it bigger, thereby making it a plausible use of his powers? In this particular run, Ralph's stretching powers are all over the map, and I'm thinking we may have crossed the line here. If this was a ""legal"" use of the power, why didn't Ralph stretch out his chest to make himself appear more buff? He was vain enough to do it back in the day. I'm thinking ""stretching"" means ""extending,"" and they went a little too far. Your thoughts?

It also bothered me when Mr. Fantastic would become a bouncing ball. I don't think stretching means you can do that, either.

And hey, did you know there was a Plastic Man tv pilot pitched to the Cartoon Network? Ah, what could have been.

Of course, Sue Dibny and Sue Storm Richards were grateful for their hubbys' ...er...talents!

Reminds me of Fred Hembeck's ""Comic Book Newlywed Game"" strip: Bob Ewebanks: ""What's the most unusual place you and Reed've made whoopee?""Sue Richards: ""The kitchen and the bedroom.""Bob: ""Well, we can only take one answer, Sue, so…""Sue: ""No, you don’t understand, Bob.I was in the kitchen, Reed was in the bedroom.....""

Luffy, the rubbery hero of One Piece, can make his body parts gigantic, but only by inflating his bones (!) first. Plus, it has the nasty side effect of leaving him shrunken and vulnerable for a few minutes afterwards.

Albion’s Fatal Tree: Crime and Society in Eighteenth-Century England

by Douglas Hay, by Peter Linebaugh, by John G. Rule, by E. P. Thompson, by Cal Winslow

Pantheon, 352 pp., $5.95 (both books will be available in mid-February) (paper)

Whigs and Hunters: The Origins of the Black Act

by E. P. Thompson

Pantheon, 313 pp., $5.95 (both books will be available in mid-February) (paper)

Twelve years ago, in 1963, Mr. E. P. Thompson exploded upon the historical scene with a book of erudition, imagination, and moral passion, The Making of the English Working Class. It is one of those books that inspire generations of scholars and students to either emulation or debunking, and it matters relatively little whether or not the major hypotheses stand the test of time. Maybe he was speaking only about a literate labor aristocracy and not about the working class generally; maybe he was grossly unfair to the Methodists; maybe the working class was not “made” as and when he said it was. The book will still remain a towering work of historical literature.

Since then Mr. Thompson has been digging back into the eighteenth century in pursuit of that study of elite and popular mentalités that the more advanced sectors of the historical profession now recognize to be as central to the process of historical change as shifts in economic, social, or political structures. The subject matter of these two new books by Mr. Thompson and his associates is the social significance of crime and the law, and they are thus part of this new drive to investigate the historical interactions of society and culture (in the anthropological sense of the term).

The keynote essay in these twin volumes is that by Douglas Hay, “Property, Authority and the Criminal Law,” which forms the introduction to Albion’s Fatal Tree. Here he sketches out a new interpretation of the social role of the law in eighteenth-century England. He tries to explain two paradoxes. Why was it that although the legislature kept adding—from about 50 to 200—to the number of offenses against property which carried the death penalty, yet the number of hangings was only about a quarter of what it had been in the seventeenth century, and if anything was tending to fall? Secondly, why did the propertied classes so obstinately refuse until the 1830s to alter this archaic system, in which practice was so wildly at variance with the statute law, despite overwhelming evidence that a milder but more regularly enforced system of punishments would protect their property more effectively and would be more in accord with natural justice and Englightenment thought?

The answer to both questions lies in the true functions of law in that society. In 1688 the ruling elite had finally rejected, as an unacceptable threat to its own power, the imposition of a Continental legal apparatus, including the abolition of the jury system and the establishment of an ubiquitous police force. This being the case, social control over the remaining 97 percent of the population had to be maintained by a mixture of terror tempered by mercy, consensus in the rough justice of the system, and an awesome display of the majesty of the law. The passage of more and more penal legislation was not intended to increase the number of hangings but merely to expand the area of the arbitrary exercise of …

Our Treatment

Adult/Couples Therapy

Though there are many similarities in the human experience, we all have unique qualities and problems. You are an important part of the treatment team. We develop a customized program to meet an individual’s and/or couple’s needs through an ongoing blend of assessments and interventions.

Family Therapy

Parents often tell us traditional psychotherapeutic approaches have not been effective with their severely attachment-disordered children, who lack the trust and ability to form a working alliance basic to success in therapy. Our family-systems approach and use of Corrective Attachment Therapy focus on assessing and changing relationship patterns.

Plant your Grape Hyacinths into well drained soil, humus rich is ideal but they will cope in poor soils with good drainage.

Grape Hyacinth bulbs are best left to naturalise where they will multiply to form nice clumps. Add some general purpose synthetic fertiliser or blood and bone as the flowers are forming and again as they are fading to ensure good growth in the coming year.

"The world’s first extinguishing water facility in port

The extinguishing water facility in the oil terminal in Malmö is completed.

“It is a purely environmental investment, from today no contaminated extinguishing water or surface water will end up in the sea if a fire was to occur, which thankfully has never happened”, says Jens Haugsöen, oil terminal manager at CMP in Malmö.

The work started in October last year on the world’s first extinguishing water facility in an oil terminal. If a fire was to occur, the contaminated extinguishing water is now dealt with in the best way possible in terms of the environment. The businesses in the oil terminal - Nordic Storage, Statoil, Vopak, OK/Q8, STS, Preem, Norcarb Engineered Carbons AB, Univar and Wibax – have paid 67%, and CMP is bearing the rest of the total of almost SEK 5 million which the project has cost to complete. Furthermore, the bulk of the operations have requirements from the Environment and Health Administration, and these have now been met”.

The extinguishing water system is an addition to CMP’s ordinary surface water system. In the event of a fire, the surface water is redirected to the extinguishing water system. An approximately 800 meter long glass-fibre reinforced pipe – known as a GAP pipeline – has been laid in the ground to transport the extinguishing water and an approximately 22 metre pool has been made for temporary storage of the water.

In principle, an extinguishing water plant doesn’t require any staff, one person starts the pump in the buffer pool when the level is sufficiently high and the plant then functions automatically.

“Large diesel-powered motors pump the water”, explains Jens Haugsöen.

The water is then conveyed from the pool onward via a pump to a 9,900 cubic metre SAFIR tank.

Stefan Kristenssons Åkeri AB carried out the excavation work and built the buffer tank where the pumping stations direct all the surface water. Depåservice AB laid the underground GAP pipeline and also installed motorised valves and pump in conjunction with Malmströms El AB.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"We're Smith & Williamson's charity

The Bristol office of accountancy, investment management and tax group, Smith & Williamson, has announced BRACE as its charity of the year for 2016-17.

Around 200 staff from Smith & Williamson’s Bristol office voted for their charity of choice and BRACE came out on top. Funds raised by the firm over the next 12 months will help to maintain BRACE’s cutting edge Brain Bank in the Learning and Research Centre at Southmead Hospital.

Mike Lea, Managing Partner at Smith & Williamson’s Bristol office, recently visited the SW Dementia Brain Bank (SWDBB) where he met BRACE’s Chief Executive Mark Poarch and Brain Bank Manager Dr Laura Palmer for a tour of the facility and to find out more about the ground-breaking work that is being done.

Mike Lea said, “Dementia touches the lives of so many people and BRACE is doing an incredible job in funding research to better understand this devastating condition. We are delighted to announce BRACE as the main beneficiary of our fundraising activities over the next 12 months. We look forward to hearing more about their work and doing as much as we can to help.”

Mark Poarch, Chief Executive of BRACE, said, “We were delighted to hear of Smith & Williamson’s decision to support dementia research with BRACE. The backing of a major professional firm can have such an impact on our fundraising and help us to build urgently-needed resources for new science here in the South West.”

He continued, “It was great to show Mike the world-leading research facilities represented by the Brain Bank. Funding research remains the best hope we have to find real treatments for this cruel condition.

"Guest Blogger: A Christian Astronomer Reflects on the Total Solar Eclipse

(This article was written to be published this coming Monday, August 21, but we decided to post it a few days early due to the tremendous interest in the upcoming total solar eclipse.)

My name is Andy Puckett, and I’m a professional astronomer. When I look at the world around me, I tend to see the big picture. The Sun “rises and sets” because the Earth rotates. Seasons change due to the tilt of the Earth’s axis. The position and phase of the Moon are based on the predictable motions of the Moon and the Earth. And all of these are based on the physical laws of the universe: motion, gravitation, acceleration.

I am also a Christian, so I see God’s hand in all of this. I know that He doesn’t move the moons and planets capriciously. I see the order and predictability of their motions. And I believe that God wrote the underlying laws of motion, and that he also gave me the curiosity to try to understand them.

Today (August 21st), many of you may get to see a total eclipse of the Sun. That’s when the Moon gets directly between the Earth and the Sun, and you find yourself in the darkest part of the Moon’s shadow. The Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun but also 400 times closer, which is the happy “coincidence” that makes this amazing event possible. But the Moon’s orbital plane doesn’t line up perfectly with the Earth’s, which is what prevents solar eclipses from being regular monthly events.

It’s very rare that a total solar eclipse passes within driving distance of your house, and even rarer for one to pass directly over where you live. If you do happen to be within the 70-mile wide “path of totality” today, you’re in for a treat! For up to 2 minutes 40 seconds, it will become as dark as night; the wind will get cooler and change direction; the solar corona will pop into view; and everyone around you will know that they’ve experienced something extraordinary.

Total Solar Eclipse

I’m a scientist, and there’s great science to be done during an eclipse, but that’s not my plan for today. I’ve been looking forward to this eclipse for 20 years, so I’m going to just take it all in. And I’m going to make sure my family gets to experience it safely, including my brother-in-law Shannon and all of our kids. I hope to help them see the big picture, and God’s hand in all of it.

A note from Shannon about this week’s article:

Andy Puckett is my brother-in-law and the Assistant Professor of Astrophysics at Columbus State University in Columbus, GA. Andy is also a practicing Catholic and is perhaps more excited than anyone else I know about the much-anticipated Total Solar Eclipse, set to dazzle us this Monday. For this article, Orin and I asked Andy to do an eclipse-related followup to Orin’s joy-themed article from a few weeks ago, entitled “Ongoing Creation”. In that article, Orin asked the question: “What is it that you are doing these days, using the creative gifts given you, at the service of God and the Church?” In our view, through the witness of his Catholic faith and the joyful enthusiasm with which he shares his knowledge of our physical universe, Andy is daily answering God’s call to glorify God with his life. We thank Andy for taking the time to write this for us.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

We are creating videos for the proper interpretation of the geopolitical and geo-economic events in the hope that when more people understand their true significance, they will be able to supplant the motives of those who are taking them for fools! Continue reading The Covert Hybrid WW3 Video Series→

In the early part of our uncivilization, there were only three estates, each with distinct political rights:

Priests or spiritual lords

Nobility or temporal lords

Commoners or slaves

Soon, the fourth estate emerged from free thinkers, philosophers, poets and playwrights. Wired technologies facilitated a new vocation called journalism. Just like its predecessor, journalism has its own limits, one of which is the unidirectional flow of information.

Today, a more decentralized exercise of sharing information and views is helping shape public opinion, i.e. blogging.

While the Fourth Estate has gone bigger and better, the First and Second Estate have decided to join forces in order to have full control of the components of the Fourth Estate. This resulted to a profound subjugation of the Third Estate.

Collectively, this elite force dominating the planet right now is called the Deep State.

Thanks to Rick2012 for the article below…

The Dollar and the Deep State

If we consider the Fed’s policies (tapering, etc.) solely within the narrow confines of the corporatocracy or a strictly financial context, we are in effect touching the foot of the elephant and declaring the creature to be short and roundish.

I have been studying the Deep State for 40 years, before it had gained the nifty name “deep state.” What others describe as the Deep State I term the National Security State which enables the American Empire, a vast structure that incorporates hard and soft power–military, diplomatic, intelligence, finance, commercial, energy, media, higher education–in a system of global domination and influence.

Back in 2007 I drew a simplified chart of the Imperial structure, what I called the Elite Maintaining and Extending Global Dominance (EMEGD):

At a very superficial level, some pundits have sought a Master Control in the Trilateral Commission or similar elite gatherings. Such groups are certainly one cell within the Empire, but each is no more important than other parts, just as killer T-cells are just one of dozens of cell types in the immune system.

One key feature of the Deep State is that it makes decisions behind closed doors and the surface government simply ratifies or approves the decisions. A second key feature is that the Deep State decision-makers have access to an entire world of secret intelligence.

Here is an example from the late 1960s, when the mere existence of the National Security Agency (NSA) was a state secret. Though the Soviet Union made every effort to hide its failures in space, it was an ill-kept secret that a number of their manned flights failed in space and the astronauts died.

The NSA had tapped the main undersea cables, and may have already had other collection capabilities in place, for the U.S. intercepted a tearful phone call from Soviet Leader Brezhnev to the doomed astronauts, a call made once it had become clear there was no hope of their capsule returning to Earth.

There is another, more shadowy, more indefinable government that is not explained in Civics 101 or observable to tourists at the White House or the Capitol. The subsurface part of the iceberg I shall call the Deep State, which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power.The term “Deep State” was coined in Turkey and is said to be a system composed of high-level elements within the intelligence services, military, security, judiciary and organized crime.

I use the term to mean a hybrid association of elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process.

I would say that only senior military or intelligence officers have any realistic grasp of the true scope, power and complexity of the Deep State and its Empire.Those with no grasp of military matters cannot possibly understand the Deep State. If you don’t have any real sense of the scope of the National Security State, you are in effect touching the foot of the elephant and declaring the creature is perhaps two feet tall.

The Deep State arose in World War II, as the mechanisms of electoral governance had failed to prepare the nation for global war. The goal of winning the war relegated the conventional electoral government to rubber-stamping Deep State decisions and policies.

After the war, the need to stabilize (if not “win”) the Cold War actually extended the Deep State. Now, the global war on terror (GWOT) is the justification.

One way to understand the Deep State is to trace the vectors of dependency. The Deep State needs the nation to survive, but the nation does not need the Deep State to survive (despite the groupthink within the Deep State that “we are the only thing keeping this thing together.”)

The nation would survive without the Federal Reserve, but the Federal Reserve would not survive without the Deep State. The Fed is not the Deep State; it is merely a tool of the Deep State.

This brings us to the U.S. dollar and the Deep State. The Deep State doesn’t really care about the signal noise of the economy–mortgage rates, minimum wages, unemployment, etc., any more that it cares about the political circus (“step right up to the Clinton sideshow, folks”) or the bickering over regulations by various camps.

What the Deep State cares about are the U.S. dollar, water, energy, minerals and access to those commodities (alliances, sea lanes, etc.). As I have mentioned before, consider the trade enabled by the reserve currency (the dollar): we print/create money out of thin air and exchange this for oil, commodities, electronics, etc.

If this isn’t the greatest trade on Earth–exchanging paper for real stuff– what is?While I am sympathetic to the strictly financial arguments that predict hyper-inflation and the destruction of the U.S. dollar, they are in effect touching the toe of the elephant.

The financial argument is this: we can print money but we can’t print more oil, coal, ground water, etc., and so eventually the claims on real wealth (i.e. dollars) will so far exceed the real wealth that the claims on wealth will collapse.

So far as this goes, it makes perfect sense. But let’s approach this from the geopolitical-strategic perspective of the Deep State: why would the Deep State allow policies that would bring about the destruction of its key global asset, the U.S. dollar?

There is simply no way the Deep State is going to support policies that would fatally weaken the dollar, or passively watch a subsidiary of the Deep State (the Fed) damage the Deep State itself.

The strictly financial arguments for hyper-inflation and the destruction of the U.S. dollar implicitly assume a system that operates like a line of dominoes: if the Fed prints money, that will inevitably start the dominoes falling, with the final domino being the reserve currency.

Setting aside the complexity of Triffin’s Paradox and other key dynamics within the reserve currency, we can safely predict that the Deep State will do whatever is necessary to maintain the dollar’s reserve status and purchasing power.

In my view, the euro currency is a regional experiment in the “bancor” model,where a supra-national currency supposedly eliminates Triffin’s Paradox. It has failed, partly because supra-national currencies don’t resolve Triffin’s dilemma, they simply obfuscate it with sovereign credit imbalances that eventually moot the currency’s ability to function as intended.

Many people assume the corporatocracy rules the nation, but the corporatocracy is simply another tool of the Deep State. Many pundits declare that the Powers That Be want a weaker dollar to boost exports, but this sort of strictly financial concern is only of passing interest to the Deep State.

The corporatocracy (banking/financialization, etc.) has captured the machinery of regulation and governance, but these are surface effects of the electoral government that rubber-stamps policies set by the Deep State.

The corporatocracy is a useful global tool of the Deep State, but its lobbying of the visible government is mostly signal noise to the Deep State. The only sectors that matter are the defense, energy, agriculture and international financial sectors that supply the Imperial Project and project power.

What would best serve the Deep State is a dollar that increases in purchasing power and extends the Deep State’s power. It is widely assumed that the Fed creating a few trillion dollars has created a massive surplus of dollars that will guarantee a slide in the dollar’s purchasing power and its demise as the reserve currency.

Those who believe the Fed’s expansion of its balance sheet will weaken the dollar are forgetting that from the point of view of the outside world, the Fed’s actions are not so much expanding the supply of dollars as offsetting the contraction caused by deleveraging.

I would argue that the dollar will soon be scarce, and the simple but profound laws of supply and demand will push the dollar’s value not just higher but much higher. The problem going forward for exporting nations will be the scarcity of dollars.

If we consider the Fed’s policies (tapering, etc.) solely within the narrow confines of the corporatocracy or a strictly financial context, we are in effect touching the foot of the elephant and declaring the creature to be short and roundish. The elephant is the Deep State and its Imperial Project.

I have suffered numerous murder attempts. The people who tried to kill me include Henry Kissinger, George Bush Sr., David de Rothschild in Geneva. And the people who are now at the source of the problems in the United States include Frank Carlucci, James Baker, Paul Wolfenson, George Soros, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Timothy Geitner; these people are murderers and criminals, you need to arrest them. If they resist arrest, they are murderers, you must shot them. You must not let these people be free. This is important, they’re planning to start World War III, and murder billions of people.

David de Rothschild in Geneva, don’t think that you’re safe in your castle there, you’re not. We know where you are, we know who you are.

And you have this serial child rapist pope, Pope Malevolent XVI. Well, he’s going to be dead soon. And good riddance, Satan is waiting for you.

There are a lot of these scumbags now, who are on the run, and we’ve got to push, we’ve got to remove them from power. They are preventing humanity from progressing. They’ve held back technical progress by at least a hundred years, if not, more. They are trying to murder four billion people. They are trying to start World War 3 right now in Iran and in Syria. And everybody say, “Gee, I don’t know what to do.” C’mon, it’s just a few old men. Why don’t you Americans put them in jail?

And I’m letting you know now, there’s a threat against Japan. There’s a ship drilling nuclear bombs into the seabed off the shore of Cheba, it’s called Shikyu Maru. And if Japan is attacked again with a nuclear tsunami, then I’ve heard that there’s going to be retaliation. They’re going to sink a large rock formation in the Canary island which will cause a 300-foot tsunami to hit the East Coast of the United States including New York, Washington DC, and Miami. You must prevent such tragedy. You must arrest these criminals. We know who they are.

And I have another thing; I want to tell the Jewish people: you are a god fearing good people ruled by Satan worshiping gangsters. Okay? The Israeli flag should have been the menorah. Instead, you have a satanic symbol. Okay? That is a satanic symbol on your flag — that is not a Jewish symbol. Why isn’t the menorah on the Israeli flag? I tell why, because the Rothschild family, who created Israel, worship Lucifer. They worship Satan. They don’t worship Yahweh. They’re not real Jews. Their real name is Bauer. They’re using you. And they’re making fool of yourselves by going along with this insane plan. Hurry up and arrest those criminals who have taken leaderships of your society.

This is not a joke. There’s enough evidence out there for everybody to know it’s true. It’s all over there. Anybody who has done any research in the well documented thoroughly proven facts will know that a criminal gang has control of your financial system for the past three hundred years, and they are planning genocide. They must be stop.

We will stop them. This is a declaration of war. Do you hear me, David the Rothschild? Okay? You’re not safe anymore. We’re tired of your murderous games.

I’ve heard that Evelyn de Rothschild, a family leader, is now quietly hiding in his castle in England. Well, Evelyn, tell your family to stand down. Tell them enough is enough. No genocide. Your family is in danger unless you stop this madness. Time is running out.

I don’t like to have an angry face just as we approach Christmas. This should be a time now, we have the possibility to have the richest possible boom in the history of civilization. We have the technology to turn the desert green. We can refill the ocean with fish. We can have world peace. And all that’s blocking us is a few dozen old men. Please everybody arrest them. What is wrong with you people?

We can have world peace. We can have all these good things. We’re just being block by a tiny group of old men who worship Satan. That’s a fact.

Please, we must save the planet. Thank you.

Final thing to say: this is not getting the bad guys. It never has been. But they are trying to get us. And after certain point, after so many murder attempts, after so much harassment, telling everybody I knew that I have gone insane, I was taking drugs. Going around and killing people I’ve known. You know, they murdered more people than anyone else in history. They’re responsible for World War 1. They are responsible for World War 2. They’re responsible for the holocaust. They killed Kennedy. They killed Martin Luther King. They killed John Lennon. They killed Michael Jackson. They’ve murdered leaders all over the world. They are the worst type of gangsters. They’ve turned the United States into a banana republic. And they are trying to turn Europe into fascist dictatorship. And all they have as their weapon is an illusion; fake money that’s not backed by anything real. We’re cutting off their money, and we’re going to put them in jail. They have to surrender.

We can have world peace. We can have prosperity. We can have increased longevity. We can rid ourselves of this nightmare. It’s just up to us.

Everybody who’s listening to this, do what you can. Remember, we outnumber them, a billion to one or more. Certainly, even in the area of the most infested, you outnumber them a hundred to one. Arrest the criminals you know, we’re closest to you, we can save this planet.

Thank you.

Kim Jong Il was murdered last Saturday in a major power struggle that’s taking place here in Asia. The Rothschild family is trying to replace him with Kim Jong Un, who’s a playboy educated in Switzerland, who they hope would follow their orders, in exchange with beautiful woman and fancy cars and other toys. But this is now a chance for the people in the Korean Peninsula to become independent once again.

They have been artificially divided in order to put under the control of the forces in Europe. There is no need for the Korean people to be divided. United, they will one of the strongest countries on Earth. There’s a chance for peace in the Korean peninsula, and of course, that would led to a boom never seen before in this region of the Earth.

At the same time, the network of North Korean agents in Japan pretending to be Japanese is being dismantled. People are being arrested. Japan is going to be free from the control of foreign forces pretending to be Japanese. And this is a chance for the Japanese and Korean people who are cousins if not brothers to have friendly and prosperous relations.

Remember, the Rothschilds need war to control us. They need war to put us in debt. There’s no need for humans to fight each other. We can have world peace. This is a chance.

A power struggle has begun. We must not give them the chance to once again put us under their control. Humanity can now free itself.

The battle has begun. We must fight them on every front until there’s world peace, and there’s an end to poverty, and an end to environmental destructions. We can accomplish that within a matter of months, once we get these murderous Satan worshiping cabal.

It is started.

This message is primarily directed to the WhiteHats and other entities working for the light. The days ahead will be heating up, but as Alfred Lambremont Webre had said, “Just enjoy the show”.

For those who have been asking, how they could join the WDS, you don’t need to. Organize your own group and effect the arrest. The evidence is overwhelming against these people, and all legal actions are useless if these cabalists are still out there.

This week’s update from Fulford, which came after his foiled assassination, is a very strong signal that they can make good of their promises to kill or arrest any member of the Cabal within their sphere of influence. It is time for the WhiteHats to do likewise.

Performance Considerations for Small-Footprint Topobathymetric LiDAR

Amar Nayegandhi, Manager of Elevation Technologies at Dewberry, posted this article earlier in the week about performance considerations for small-footprint topobathymetric LIDAR and their use of the RIEGL VQ-820-G airborne laser scanner. Enjoy!

A new suite of commercial small-footprint, green-wavelength airborne LiDAR systems are being developed to enable topobathymetric mapping in coastal and riverine environments. These sensors can provide seamless topography across the land-water interface at very high spatial resolution (five to six points per square meter).

The Role of Water Clarity in Mapping Submerged TopographyWater clarity plays a vital role in the ability of topobathymetric systems to map submerged topography. Compared to traditional bathymetric LiDAR systems, topobathymetric LiDAR uses a low-power laser pulse, resulting in a depth performance between one and two Secchi depth. Traditional bathymetric LiDAR sensors offer up to three Secchi depths, but with a footprint 20 times wider than topobathymetric LiDAR. Small-footprint topobathymetric LiDAR sensors can map submerged topography between 20 to 25 meters in clear water with high reflective bottom (such as sand), but may only map up to two meters in turbid waters.

Mapping Topobathymetry in Various Riverine EnvironmentsIn collaboration with Watershed Sciences, Inc., we used the Riegl VQ-820-G sensor to collect and process topobathymetric data in Sandy River for the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Studies. We mapped channel and floodplain morphology and evaluated the effectiveness of new topobathymetric LiDAR technology in a riverine environment.

The results showed that in more than 83 percent of the channel (a “high confidence” area), bathymetric point density averaged two points per square meter, with water depths ranging from zero to three meters. The remaining 17 percent of the channel (a “low confidence” area) contained water deeper than three meters. In the high confidence area, we compared the LiDAR measurements with 303 channel points acquired using GPS-based techniques along channel cross sections. The bathymetric accuracy was assessed at 18.4 centimeters RMSE.

These results suggest that topobathymetric LiDAR is a viable solution to mapping channel and floodplain morphology at Sandy River for ongoing monitoring studies to understand the impacts of the 2007 Marmot Dam removal on downstream morphology and fish habitat.

The image of the left shows the mouth of the Sandy River flowing into the Columbia River. Using the Riegl VQ-820-G sensor, we obtained a seamless topobathymetric Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the same area—water depths ranging from zero to three meters.

Commercializing Small-Footprint Topobathymetric LiDARThe commercialization of small-footprint topobathymetric LiDAR has opened the possibility of high-resolution seamless topography and bathymetry in coastal and riverine environments. The applications of these data are endless and there is a lot of excitement within the geospatial community on the use of this technology. However, it’s important to understand the technology’s limitations and the conditions that will enable a successful survey. Water clarity and bottom reflectivity play a very important role. Knowledge of the LiDAR sensor and production process is crucial to a successful topobathy dataset.

At Dewberry, we’re at the forefront of this new commercial technology with successful completion of three recent topobathymetric projects, such as Sandy River, using the Riegl VQ-820-G sensor.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"A Finnair pilot arrested with more than $800,000 while on his Melbourne honeymoon thought the cash was his wife's, a court has heard.

A lawyer for Finnish national Lauri Metsaranta, who is charged with dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime, told the Melbourne Magistrates Court his client was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

In a police interview, Metsaranta said he thought the cash was his wealthy wife's money, ""like someone owed her money or something"", the court heard.

Metsaranta said he did not know he and his common law wife, Changchen Chen, would be collecting the cash en route to their suite at the Hyatt in February, on the Australian leg of a trip that was ""sort of a honeymoon"".

Chen has also been charged with dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime.

In the interview read to the court, Metsaranta said he had picked up instruments or other small things for his wife before, but the large sum of money was unusual.

Metsaranta had never met his wife's family, who live in China, but he knew they were very wealthy, the court heard.

He and his wife had known each other about 18 months when they were arrested in Melbourne.

He said when they collected the cash from the Mantra hotel he was not concerned about where it was coming from or where it was going, he was just hoping they wouldn not be robbed.

""To me it felt a little grey area,"" Metsaranta told police.

""I have to admit I was a little uncomfortable with that much money.""

Metsaranta said his wife had received a call after they landed in Melbourne, but he did not know what it was about because he could not speak Mandarin or Cantonese.

They travelled to a second hotel ""where a huge pile of money was"".

""All I see is the sports bag but I have no idea of the origins of the money,"" Metsaranta said.

He said his wife dealt with an Asian man at the hotel, but he did not have a conversation with him and had never met him before.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Mario Manningham paused from his own injury rehabilitation Thursday to rally 49ers teammates in the wake of Michael Crabtree's Achilles tear.""It's sad to see somebody get hurt that's a great value to our team,"" Manningham told SiriusXM NFL Radio, ""but the next person has to step up, man. We all know injuries are a part of the game.""Manningham sustained a season-ending left knee injury Dec. 23 at Seattle, and he's been constantly rehabilitating from that anterior cruciate ligament tear.""I have started and running cutting and doing little things,"" Manningham said. ""When you have knee injuries, you can't really take any time off. Every time I think about it, I'm trying to do something with my knee. I'm not rushing it but I am going hard on my knee.""Manningham, the 49ers' second-leading receiver last year, is not expected to be ready for the start of training camp in two months. The 49ers open defense of their NFC title Sept. 8 against the Green Bay Packers at Candlestick Park.Rather than announce a timetable for his return, Manningham said: ""Whenever God wants me to come out and play, then when I'm 100 (percent), that's when I'm going to go out there.""Crabtree is likely out for at least the next five months. The 49ers are currently without three of their top four receivers, with only Anquan Boldin fully healthy while Crabtree, Manningham and Kyle Williams (knee) rehabilitate their injuries.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Overview

Wise Preservation Planning LLC completed a Historic Resource Impact Study for
Cheyney University in 2010. The Study was submitted per Thornbury Township, Delaware
County historic resource protection ordinance. The project involved the demolition of
the non-historic Robinson Hall Dormitory (and later two other dormitories in the
residential complex) and the construction of a new residential complex of buildings.
The study was required because the proposed project was adjacent to several identified
historic resources, including the University's early 20th century Quadrangle. The
""Quad"", consisting of substantial stone buildings, is the heart of the campus.

In recent years, the University has renovated several historic buildings and has
started to relocate activities to the historic Quad. Major recommendations by Wise
called for reducing any negative impact of the new construction upon the Quad and
in fact visually and functionally integrating the new complex with specific historic
resources within the Quad.

Cheyney University is the current name of an institution that was founded in
Philadelphia in 1837. It operated under the guidance of a board of Quakers until
the early 20th century. The campus relocated to Thornbury Township in 1903.
Buildings on the historic Quad were built during the first three decades
of the 20th century, partially during the long presidency of Leslie P. Hill
(1913-1951). During the 1960s and 1970s, Cheyney extended the campus off the
Quad. Robinson Hall was built on the site of the former Elkinton Athletic Field
in 1964. Cheyney became a University in 1983, and with the passage of time, it
has been increasingly interested in the re-use of its historic buildings. The
image on the left shows the architects' rendering of the proposed new residence hall.

The Impact Study recommendations were generally accepted by the University and
the Township. The report commended Cheyney University for its foresight in planning
for the future of its campus. The reconstruction project is now underway.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"A semi-biased commentary on British and American politics, culture and current affairs

Contraception

CULTURE

Amanda Marcotte, writing at Slate magazine, makes a compelling case for movie scriptwriters and directors to show more condom use in their movies. She makes a fair point: “In the world of movies and TV, people seem to be having sex all the time, but they almost never talk about or are shown using contraception. Since so much of movie sex serves the plot, you get encounters that are much more spontaneous than they would be in real life, without any pause in the action to wrap it up. Young viewers could easily get the sense that the norm is to hop right in bed with someone without ever worrying about unintended pregnancy.” And it’s true – if realism is your aim (and admittedly this is not always the case), pretending that people hop into bed with each other without going through that awkward “fumbling in the bedside cabinet drawer” moment is a misrepresentation, and one that can be easily (and, if done well, humorously) corrected.

Jim Henson Studios, creator of The Muppets, is boycotting Chick-fil-A over that company’s president’s condemnation of gay marriage. In a stern rebuke, their statement reads: “The Jim Henson Company has celebrated and embraced diversity and inclusiveness for over fifty years and we have notified Chick-Fil-A that we do not wish to partner with them on any future endeavors”.

Proco Moreno, Alderman of Chicago’s 1st Ward, joined in the anti Chick-fil-A backlash, stating that he would block the restaurant chain’s attempts to open their second Chicago outlet in his district because of the aforementioned statement issued by their CEO. His statement is somewhat over-the top – “If you are discriminating against a segment of the community, I don’t want you in the 1st Ward” – it is hard to see how any discrimination is taking place, as the restaurant does not check the sexual orientation of its customers upon entry, or have any policies in place that discriminate against one or another. But the fact remains that needlessly coming out in favour of a regressive social policy position that has no direct impact on your business or bottom line, can cost you money.

Getting in on the act, The Onion reports on Chick-fil-A’s new homophobic sandwich. Reports The Onion: “In a press conference to reporters, company representatives said the homophobic new sandwich will include the national fast food chain’s trademark fried chicken filet wrapped in a piece of specially-smoked No Homo ham that would be topped with a slice of Swiss cheese and lathered in a creamy new Thousand Island-based Fag Punching sauce”.

BRITISH POLITICS

The UK economy shrank by another 0.7% according to the latest figures released today. Iain Martin, writing in The Telegraph, thinks that George Osborne has six months to turn things around. I would guess that this estimate sounds about right, but I am not optimistic that Osborne will do anything differently, given his obstinate refusal to implement the needed supply-side reforms, and his obsession with trying to score cheap political points from Ed Balls, a diversion which should be beneath him.

The Guardian’s foremost education journalist twists herself in knots trying to explain why she is against private schools, and yet is sending her daughter to a private school. She takes a whole article, and many unnecessary words to explain what I can say in just three – she’s a hypocrite. She says: “I remember reading about Diane Abbott’s decision to send her son to the £10,000-a-year City of London school. She said she was a mother first and a politician second, a point that resonated strongly with me.” Precisely. She’s happy to inflict her left-wing social engineering on other people to make them conform to her ideal worldview (uniform standards, uniform people, uniform outcomes), but as soon as her own interests come in to play, she takes the conservative position.

AMERICAN POLITICS

Oh noes. The house of cards built by Grover Norquist has started to come crashing down as more and more elected officials repudiate his “tax pledge”. Whether you think the current tax burden in America is sustainable or not, I think most reasonable people can agree that Norquist’s pledge is overly restrictive on lawmakers, preventing them from closing unwarranted and discriminatory tax loopholes on the grounds that doing so would constitute a “tax increase”. Norquist, and his advocacy group Americans for Tax Reform, are one of several significant hurdles standing in the way of a fundamental simplification of the existing byzantine tax code. We should all cheer its demise, and hope that similar obstacles from the American left fall by the wayside too, in the name of meaningful, lasting reform.

It is hard to disagree with this piece from Marbury, discussing the old-fashioned political art of persuasion, and the relative aptitudes of Obama and Clinton at using it. Through the lense of the Northern Irish “Good Friday” peace accord, Marbury looks at the way that President Clinton was able to flatter, cajole and reassure the key parties so that they reached a point where a deal could be signed, and how this skill is currently lacking in the Obama administration. Money quote: “Obama likes the big set-piece speech. But every policy he has backed, from the stimulus to healthcare, has declined in popularity the more speeches he made about it. His speeches explain things very well, very precisely. But they don’t change minds. This, it turns out, was the big hole in Obama’s campaign rhetoric of unification, of bringing red and blue together. He spoke about it eloquently, but he was never going to be the president who put it into action. Obama is a preacher, not a persuader. He’s terrific if you already agree with him, but doesn’t have much impact on those who don’t.”

Jacob Weisberg, writing in Slate magazine, effectively deconstructs the Romney campaign’s attempts to smear President Obama with the “Chicago machine politician” label. Says Weisberg: “Of course, Romney isn’t interested in this kind of nuance. ‘Chicago-style politics’ is mainly just a way for him to call Obama corrupt without coming out and saying so”.

At least some people in the Republican Party seem to have woken up to the demographic timebomb ticking away under their feet, and have started to lament, if not yet analyse, the fact that the vast majority of young people in America today would sooner give up their loud music and Pac-Man video games (or whatever it is that young people do for fun these days) than vote for a GOP candidate in a presidential election.

Mitt Romney is apparently the latest Republican to develop a sense of outrage that no one outside of the grey haired brigade would be seen dead voting for him:

‘I don’t mean to be flip with this,’’ said Mitt Romney during a Q&A with students at the University of Chicago last week. “But I don’t see how a young American can vote for a Democrat.’’ He cheerfully apologized to anyone who might find such a comment “offensive,’’ but went on to explain why he was in earnest.

The Democratic Party “is focused on providing more and more benefits to my generation, mounting trillion-dollar annual deficits my generation will never pay for,’’ Romney said. While Democrats are perpetrating “the greatest inter-generational transfer of wealth in the history of humankind,’’ Republicans are “consumed with the idea of getting federal spending down and creating economic growth and opportunity so we can balance our budget and stop putting these debts on you.’’

At which point the needle on my “Are You For Real?” machine jolted as far toward the “You Must Be Kidding” end of the spectrum as it could go before the whole machine exploded in a shower of sparks.

The author himself does a good job of pouring cold water on any Republican claims to the mantle of fiscal restraint:

But that debt wasn’t piled up without plenty of Republican help. During George W. Bush’s presidency, annual federal spending skyrocketed from $1.8 trillion to $3.4 trillion, and $4.9 trillion was added to the national debt. Bush left the White House, in fact, as the biggest spender since LBJ . Granted, the profligacy of Barack Obama has outstripped even Bush’s bacchanal: CBS reports that Obama has added more to the national debt in just three years and two months than Bush did in his entire eight years. Still, younger voters can hardly be blamed if they haven’t noticed that Republicans are “consumed with the idea of getting federal spending down.’’

Therefore I do not intend to say anything more about the glaring, shameless hypocrisy of the Republicans – the party that gifted America two unfunded wars, large tax breaks not balanced by spending cuts and the joke that is Medicare Part D – laying any claim whatsoever to competency in handling the nation’s finances. Except that I will say that much of the “profligacy of Barack Obama” mentioned by the author was the result of a fiscal stimulus implemented (despite its imperfections) at a time when the US economy was in freefall, and without which the tepid recovery currently being experienced would likely be nothing but a sweet dream.

Mitt Romney and those others in the Republican Party who scratch their heads wondering why young people don’t like them miss the point entirely when they sulk that young people should embrace their economic policies. Though their fiscal policies may perhaps benefit young people in certain ways (and even this is arguable), there is no evidence based on past behaviour that they will actually have the political courage to implement them if voted into office. Old people (the beneficiaries of the “wealth transfers” that Romney claims to lament) actually vote in large numbers. Younger people don’t. The policy priorities of our political candidates duly reflect this fact.

Besides, it is not the GOP’s economic policies that are the main problem. The problem is the fact that in a bad economy, the opposition party is spending more time talking about abortion, contraception, mass deportations of illegal immigrants, repealing ObamaCare, questioning the president’s eligibility to hold office, and reinstating “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” and a host of other socially regressive policy positions which are anathema to a majority of young people today than they are about how to reduce unemployment and help a population ill-equipped to perform the more highly-skilled, non-manufacturing jobs of tomorrow.

Rick Santorum in particular often complains that the media focuses on his socially conservative policy positions and not his economic plan, but he can hardly expect young voters to thrust him into office on the back of his inspired ideas on the economy (spoiler – they are not that great) when they are more worried that he will cut off their unemployment insurance, or close down the Planned Parenthood centre where they go for medical care, or start a war with Iran.

It is no coincidence that the one Republican presidential candidate who actually walks the fiscal conservatism walk and who doesn’t continually bleat on about social issues and the culture wars – Ron Paul – vastly outperforms his rivals with young voters, in primary after primary.

Newsflash to Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich:

Even if you had a cogent economic policy (which, by the way, none of you do) you will never appeal to young people by just tweaking your fiscal message a little bit. You had a choice when you started your presidential campaigns, and in your desperation to secure the party base you chose to fearmonger and rant about “taking back America”, and fret about turning into a socialist state, and speak about the importance of individal freedom in one breath while promising to impose your religious values on the whole country in the next.

Many young people would like an alternative to President Barack Obama, but you offer them nothing by way of a contrasting, conservative vision for the country that they could ever find acceptable. You offer them nothing. You offer racial minorities nothing. You offer women nothing. You offer the working poor and the unemployed nothing. And all of these constituencies will dutifully line up to vote for Barack Obama, and you will lose the presidential election on November 6th.

It could be otherwise, if only you offered the American people a genuine acceptable choice when they cast their votes.

I have a partly tongue-in-cheek list of US states that I am currently ‘boycotting’, or have no intention of visiting in the immediate future, either because of unfortunate things that have happened to me there, or most usually because of particularly stupid and offensive laws that have been either proposed or actually voted on and passed in their legislatures.

Arizona was already strongly competing to join this exclusive list (it is difficult to join and even harder to be removed from the list) with the signing by Gov. Jan Brewer of their famous anti-illegal-immigration law, allowing state police to detain anyone suspected of being an illegal immigrant (quite how you tell such a person from a natural US citizen by their appearance or behaviour is anyone’s guess, but I think we all know the criteria they have in mind):

But then came this gem that I was alerted to by a friend on Facebook – now, the Arizona State Senate Judiciary Committee (a pompous title for a pompous group of individuals) has endorsed a controversial bill that will, if passed, allow Arizona employees to exclude contraception coverage from the healthcare plans that they offer to their employees, if their religious beliefs or moral convictions encourage them to do so. Furthermore, the bill would also allow employers to demand proof of a medical prescription (for non birth-control related reasons) if an employee wishes to claim for contraceptive pills on their health insurance policy.

The author of the bill – one Debbie Lesko, Republican of course – says that:

“So, government should not be telling the organizations or mom and pop employers to do something against their moral beliefs.”

Okay, well guess what. Maybe I’ll set up shop in Arizona and start a small business. But I am from a small and little-known religion that doesn’t believe in mammograms or cervical cancer screening. I don’t know why, my particular interpretation of my hypothetical holy book just tells me that to test for these diseases to allow early intervention would be an affront to God. So none of my female employees will get to benefit from these forms of healthcare as part of the insurance plan that I provide them. Oh, and my new religion also thinks that heart disease and erectile dysfunction are punishments from God that should be meekly accepted rather than treated, so no Viagra or anti-cholesterol medication for the gents. If you need Viagra to treat some other ailment not connected with erectile dysfunction we can maybe talk about coming to an agreement, but I’ll need a signed letter from your doctor explaining your precise medical history and needs.

Can you imagine the uproar?

Let us be quite clear. This is not about freedom of religion. Many states have been living under an expressed requirement that employers include birth control coverage in their healthcare plans for many years with nary a whisper of complaint until a Democrat named Barack Obama occupied the oval office. This is about slowly trying to establish a fundamentalist Christian theocracy in America, one in which even the overwhelming majority of Christians, myself included, would not wish to live in were it fully implemented. Republicans – who once criticised Obama because of the type of Christian church that he attended and the pastor who preached there – have decided that it would now be more politically fruitful to fan the embers of suspicion that he is in fact a muslim, and that he is launching an all-out assault on “Judeo-Christian” principles.

And while we’re on the topic, can someone please initiate a sensible conversation about moving away from the current employer-based health insurance system in America? Aside from the damage it does to the economy in terms of issues such as impeding mobility of labour (especially important during the current fragile recovery with unemployment so high), if individuals purchased their own health insurance rather than relying on the employer to do it for them, we could sidestep this whole argument about coercing employers to act against their moral beliefs. If Debbie Lesko ever chose to leave her political career and return to the private sector, she wouldn’t have to stay up all night worrying about what naughty things her employees might be doing with the healthcare coverage that she paid for, because the employees would be paying the premiums and taking their chances that they won’t be struck down by lightning for daring to use a condom, or the pill. And I think everyone would sleep better at night as a result.

Arizona, you have been teetering on the brink for a long time now. But congratulations, you have officially made the list.

I decided to join the Roman Catholic church at eighteen years of age, and went through the Church’s RCIA programme (the Rite of Catholic Initiation of Adults), which required attending weekly lessons with the parish priest over a period of six months. I look back on the night that I was confirmed into the Church as one of the happiest and most sacred moments of my life, and though the strength of my faith (and my weekly Mass attendance) has seen several peaks and rather more lows in the intervening decade, I still consider myself a member of the Church, and I always intend to be.

Many people have made similar conversions to the Church, notably two of the current Republican presidential contenders, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum. It is said that there is no zealot like a convert, and though I may be the exception to the rule, Gingrich and Santorum appear to prove it rather well with many of their public pronouncements. In many respects, both men are probably better and more observant Catholics than me, at least now (Gingrich), and I don’t presume to judge them at all. What I will do, however, is call them out when they claim to represent the only political party that will defend Catholic teachings and priorities. Because that is pure, grade A baloney.

Said Newt Gingrich of the ObamaCare requirement for employers operating in the public sphere, serving the public and employing people regardless of their religious affiliation, to offer health insurance that includes access to birth control:

“I frankly don’t care what deal he tries to cut; this is a man who is deeply committed. If he wins re-election, he will wage war on the Catholic Church the morning after he is re-elected.”

(Yes, I fear that the O RLY owl is going to be a frequent visitor to this blog).

Really, Newt? Wage war? I’m curious to see Obama’s glistening new clone army sitting in storage, waiting for Inauguration Day in January 2013 when they will be activated and unleashed to desecrate churches and force people into unwilling same-sex marriages across the land.

If I could talk with Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Santorum, I would say: the protection of life should not end at the moment of birth. I will never understand my Church’s current teaching on contraception – especially when male sexual enhancement drugs, in vitro fertilisation and other techniques that can result in the creation or destruction of a fertilised embryo are given a free pass, while contraception, the morning-after pill and stem cell research are not. But I can appreciate the consistency of the argument that all human life is precious, is worthy of respect, and that none should be taken unnecessarily. My own views on abortion are not yet fully developed, but I know that I would want it to be as rare as possible, and yet readily available at least under some limited circumstances (such as the survival of the mother, rape or incest, or in the case of catastrophic developmental anomalies). I understand your policies for caring for and protecting life while it is in the womb. But what effect would your policies have once these children are born? Is it important, as you so often say, that they are born into loving (married, heterosexual) families who are ready for a child, or does it not matter if they are unwanted and abused, or end up in the custody of the state until they reach eighteen years of age? It’s all very well advocating strongly for a new life until it reaches the nine month threshold, but what then?

And to the Bishops, I would say: why do you deny holy communion to politicians who advocate for general public access to abortion services (while not supporting the practice themselves), but welcome with open arms those who support the death penalty, fight measures to improve social justice, support the torture of enemy prisoners or beat the drum for pre-emptive wars around the globe? You diminish your public standing, your credibility and the importance of these other important Church teachings when you do so.

Andrew Sullivan makes a similar point in his excellent blog, with regard to the current enthusiasm in Republican circles to go to war with Iran:

“I’d also argue that pre-emptive war based on an enemy’s alleged intentions, when it publicy declares the opposite, or based on inherent evil or insanity is counter to just war theory. Certainly the rhetoric of Santorum and Gingrich on this subject is a profound attack on Catholic just-war teaching. But don’t expect the Bishops to make any fuss about that. War and torture seem trivial issues to them, compared with access to contraception or gay rights.”

Seriously, maybe I missed this in my RCIA classes. Will a Republican (since they are the ones who claim to have the direct hotline to God these days) please let me know which of these Church teachings it is okay to brazenly defy while still declaring myself a proud standard-bearer for the Church, and which are so inviolable that I would be literally declaring war on Catholicism if I dare to dissent? Thanks.

“The America I know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with Down Syndrome will have to stand in front of Obama’s ‘death panel’ so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their ‘level of productivity in society’, whether they are worthy of health care. Such a system is downright evil” – Sarah Palin, August 2009

“Barack Obama is the most dangerous president in modern American history. This administration has intellectually disarmed, it is morally disarmed, it is incapable of describing what threatens us” – Newt Gingrich, Republican Presidential Candidate, February 2012

“People have birth certificates. He doesn’t have a birth certificate. He may have one but there’s something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim. I don’t know. Maybe he doesn’t want that. Or he may not have one. But I will tell you this. If he wasn’t born in this country, it’s one of the great scams of all time” – Donald Trump, Improbably Rich Idiot, March 2011

On the Federal Budget.

The US national debt stood at $10.6 trillion when President Obama took office, and in 2011 reached $14.6 trillion. Cue lots of self-righteous bluster from the American right that Obama is wrecking the national finances and, to use a much overwrought phrase “running up the national credit card” that the next generation will have to pay off.

You can agree or disagree with Obama’s economic stimulus, and TARP, and the auto bailouts – though as I remind my Republican friends, it is easy to criticise all of these measures and claim that they had no positive effect when none of us will ever have to live in an alternate reality where they had not taken place. What you cannot do, however, is pose as a staunch fiscal conservative and a concerned American worried about the financial stability of the United States if you have done any of the following:

Voted to approve the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without seeking additional revenues to fund them.

Voted for Medicare Part D, the prescription drug programme for elderly Americans, again with no commensurate revenue increases (strange how “government-run healthcare” is an assault on individual liberty, with the huge exception of Medicare).

Voted for or supported the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 that were not met with equal cuts to government spending.

Obstructed the recent vote to raise the US debt ceiling, raising fears of a default and directly resulting in the downgrading of the government’s AAA credit rating.

On Religious Liberty.

I have amused myself watching several of the Republican presidential candidates twisting themselves in rhetorical knots trying to make the case that the founding fathers were only joking when they enshrined a “wall of separation between church and state” in the constitution (in Rick Santorum’s case, he went as far as to say that it made him physically sick to contemplate). Or rather, that it exists in much the same way as a cell membrane permits osmosis, allowing religion (or rather, certain favoured religions and denominations) to impose their beliefs beyond their congregations on the entire US population while making religious organisations themselves immune from any requirement to conform to state or federal laws.

If we take as one example the recent furore over the fact that the Affordable Care Act (ACA, ObamaCare) mandates that insurance companies provide birth control coverage, it is telling that many of the religious prelates – including many Catholic Bishops – have lived under similar requirements to provide employees with insurance that includes birth control in their home states for many years without raising a chorus of objection, until the same issue came up at a federal level. One cannot help but feel that religion and the concept of religious freedom are being used as a convenient cudgel with which to bash the Democrats in an election year, rather than being truly respected and protected by the GOP.

In terms of the Tea Party, there seems to be a genuine if uneven split between the minority true libertarians (of the Ron Paul mould) who believe in a separation of church and state and have the courage to say so, and the bulk of those others who are able to maintain in their minds the cognitive dissonance that must surely arise when you advocate for individual liberty in the economic realm on one hand, but insist that people abide by select teachings from your holy book (whichever it may be) on the other.

On Healthcare.

Being a conservative used to mean being a realist, dealing with the world as it is and hopefully proposing pragmatic, typically non-radical solutions. One of the persistent problems with the US healthcare system is the “free rider” problem. Hospitals are required to treat and care for any patient that arrives suffering from a grave, life-threatening injury or illness, regardless of whether or not that patient carries health insurance. Of course, this includes the more than 30% of Americans who lack such insurance. Even the most fervent tea-partier would (probably) pause before proposing that people be left to die on the street if they are in need of medical care but lacked insurance.

Unfortunately, this creates a rather significant free rider problem, with US taxpayers and health insurance policyholders essentially paying to cover the cost of these uninsured healthcare expenses. This contributes to the unsustainable rate of inflation in US healthcare costs, makes no sense and is just plain silly. Even the conservative Heritage Foundation used to think so too, and at one time proposed an individual mandate requiring all citizens to purchase at least basic health insurance (http://www.forbes.com/sites/aroy/2011/10/20/how-a-conservative-think-tank-invented-the-individual-mandate).

But now any such mandate is considered a grave assault on liberty. Okay, constitutional scholars can debate that point for a long time. But pragmatic conservatives should surely try to find a way around this issue, to solve the serious free rider problem which makes healthcare more expensive for everyone. Instead, the tea party rail against the “tyranny” of having to purchase healthcare, and yet say nothing about the free rider problem which hurts lower income people most of all in the form of higher insurance premiums and medical bills. Neither do they propose an alternative solution to address the fact that so many of their fellow citizens – some through choice but many through no fault of their own – live with the daily fear that accident or sudden illness could bring them to ruin. And no, promising to clamp down on medical malpractice lawsuits and muttering quietly about perhaps allowing insurers to sell policies across state lines, while both sensible ideas, do not solve a problem of this magnitude.

I could go on to talk about “death panels” – the GOP’s term for the basic idea that end-of-life care counselling should be offered (not mandated, just offered) as part of health insurance policies in order that more people are given the opportunity to make these key decisions while they are young and healthy, and potentially avert the suffering and huge proportion of total lifetime medical expense which is incurred during the end stages of terminal diseases, through the issuance of Do Not Resuscitate Orders etc. But there is no need, because anyone who reads the language in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and somehow extrapolates in their mind that offering end of life counselling as part of an insurance plan could in any way equate to a “death panel” that decides whether the disabled or infirm should live or die is clearly smoking something quite mind-alteringly potent and will not be swayed by anything committed to print here.

I could also talk about the fact that the GOP’s constant use of the term “government-run healthcare”, or suggestions that government has taken over the healthcare industry (i.e. nationalisation) are ludicrous, alarmist and clearly and demonstrably false. But again, there is no need, because any thinking person should be able to see that while government may have now infringed on the way that consumers choose their health insurance provider (to some limited extent, in certain cases), this insurance and the healthcare itself is still provided by private-sector or non-profit organisations as much as it ever was. Those who scream “government takeover” or “socialism” would do well to go back to school and relearn the meaning of those terms – were it not for the fact that getting a college education is, of course, a form of snobbery these days.

But there is no need to talk about these things. At present there is no reasoning or engaging at all on the topic of health reform with the Tea Party-beholden GOP, who, in the words of David Frum, “followed the most radical voices in the party and the movement, and [were led] to abject and irreversible defeat”. (http://www.frumforum.com/waterloo). ObamaCare is here now, with all of its benefits and imperfections. The Republicans had an opportunity to engage with the Democrats and ensure that some more conservative principles were included in the law. Instead, they chose obstructionism and got none of what they wanted.

Why Now?

I am curious about this, and I would love for any thinking, Tea Party-supporting readers to comment and to help educate me. I do not believe that the recent groundswell of constitutional originalism and small government fervour is entirely the result of resentment that a black man currently occupies the Oval Office. I think it is a factor, but not the only one, or even the main one necessarily.

However, given the fact that the US federal government expanded in terms of raw expenditure, percentage of GDP, scope of activities and power over the individual for many years prior to the election of Barack Obama, I would like to understand – why the Tea Party, why now? Why the sudden need in 2009 for people to buy pocket editions of the US constitution, to dress up in 18th century clothes, to attend these rallies and rail against the subversion of America? Why deselect long-serving and relatively competent congressional representatives in favour of unknowledgeable and in some cases laughable primary challengers who vowed even before getting to Washington (or declaring on television that they are not a witch and being comprehensively beaten, in one depressing case) that they would never seek to strike a bipartisan deal?

If you are a fiscal conservative, that’s great, campaign for greater fiscal responsibility. If you believe in small, limited government – marvellous, advocate strongly for it (I assume that your enthusiastic support of individual liberty applies to peoples’ bedroom and nuptial activities too though, right?) If you believe that some of the key edifices of the American social safety net and federal government are technically unconstitutional, then you can probably make that argument quite convincingly. But before you do any of those things, and if your name is not Ron Paul, please explain where you stood, and who and what you voted for in the months and years prior to Inauguration Day, 2009.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"I think the real issue here is that most people don't understand /how/ to use MongoDB.

The best use case for MongoDB is as a document store. I can essentially cache numerous MySQL requests into a compiled set of useful information. Especially if the information changes somewhat infrequently, then instead of running MySQL requests for every page load I can pull the information from MongoDB. In most cases when I use MongoDB, its not as a persistent data store, but as a ""compiled"" data store.

MongoDB also has some useful set operations.

"November is flying by and that means the end of the semester will be here in a month or less. Ultimately, lots of exams and papers that need to be written. Methinks, however, I will write about that particular topic in another post…perhaps on summing up Fall 2010 semester at large. I think I’ll post something for the very end of the year as well. But I digress. Without further ado–may I present Richelle Mead’s Shadow Kiss.

“Suddenly, the burn of that black magic vanished from the bond, along with that sickening sensation. Something hit me like a blast of wind in the face, and I staggered backward I shuddered as a weird sensation twisted my stomach. It was like sparks, like a coil of electricity burning within me” (340).

Probably my favorite out of the series thus far. There was so much action in this particular novel–I can only imagine the coming action in the next novels-I am so excited! I guess you want an example of this action, yes? I figured–you shouldn’t want so many spoilers, my dear readers. 😉 But guess what–the above is as much as you’re getting. Anyway, Mead has done a wonderful job with Shadow Kiss as far as her descriptions and the plot is, as usual, fantastic!

To be ‘shadow kissed’ means to have been to the other side and come back; a second chance at life and forever bonded with whomever brought you back. Rose is shadow kissed and that is why she is bonded to Lissa Dragomir, a spirit user (keep in mind spirit is highly rare). It is one of the five elements the Moroi use as magic: Fire, Earth, Wind, Water, and Spirit. Adrian Ivashkov is actually another spirit user and fire belongs to Christian Ozera. Speaking of Christian, I really want him to become less insecure–he is such a sweet guy and Lissa loves him. That and he helps Rose kick some serious Strigoi ass. Sweet!!

I’ve come to the conclusion that Adrian is going to be another Mason. Sad day. Good guys who love Rose, but she doesn’t or didn’t want them. Not saying that Belikov isn’t *cough*wasn’t*cough* a good guy, but she can’t be exclusive with him and the really places burden on her shoulders that she shouldn’t have. However, if there is one thing I believe to be true–just because someone is good to you does not mean you will be happy. I’m hoping that Rose will be able to find someone who can be her equal in most, if not all facets of their lives. Or, I should say that Mead will hopefully write the story in that way.

So, anyway–lots of laughs, action, and a perfect amount of romance… and heartbreak. I leave you to read and discover what happens. I’m still rooting for Dimitri Belikov and Rose–but there’s a lot that needs to happen in order for that to happen. If you’ve read the books, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about…

I loved Shadow Kiss! Completely fantastic and it is because it was so good I read it in one day–I want to say six hours. I’m giving Richelle Mead’s Shadow Kiss a 4/4.5 out of 5. Impressive and truly pulls you into their world.

“Unique and mesmerizing… this little gem is sure to be a hit… Readers will bite on this series for some time to come.”–VOYA

Hello Readers. Long time, no see. So far, October has been a busy month. And besides, since it is October, you would think I would try to get a theme for all the books I read and make them all supernatural–I already read that general genre, so I’m good and maybe slightly ahead of the game. 76 days (give or take a day or two) until a new year which means I will soon be compiling a new list of books that look interesting. This time I know to keep it looking reasonable. So, to the reason this entry is going up:Frostbite byRichelle Mead. If you haven’t already guessed, the title says it all.

“It had taken me several moments to grasp what she was talking about. Then it occurred to me that in decapitating two Strigoi, I’d earned two molnija tattoos. My first ones. The realization had stunned me. All my life, in considering my future career as a guardian, I’d looked forward to the marks. I’d seen them as badges of honor. But now? Mainly they were going to be reminders of something I wanted to forget” (Pg. 312).

In the sequel to Vampire Academy, our favorite dhampir is back and we meet her mother, Janine Hathaway. I won’t pretend to have immediately liked her character, but the more I read, the more I understood her. While part of me is going, “Yes! I understand the mind of a parent!” While at the same time, my mind is screaming at me, “What the hell!” In any case, based on Rose’s words in Vampire Academy, I’d assumed that her mother would not be in the picture at all. The way it had been worded made me think “working mom who puts her career before her child.” However, reading this novel made all the difference. So, that being said, you will like Janine.

Speaking of people you will like, I would like to bring up someone you will love. I would know, I fall in love with fictional characters–but that’s another blog, another time. Anyway! Guardian Dimitri Belikov. There is so much going on with him and Rose in Frostbite–intense as hell. I mean, you add another woman into the mix–not cool Belikov, not cool. Buuut, things are working out and reaaally going well. Things are amping up! I mean, stuff happened with Mason–he might have been what she needed, but he was not what she wanted.

Btw–RIP Mason. That’s all I’m saying.

Now, I’m very happy for Lissa and Christian. Interesting new character by the name of Adrian. Bad boy in every sense of the word–almost–he has a heart of gold. There are other characters that have been developed a great deal and I am really enjoying seeing them transform into the kind of character that is endearing. Granted, there are some that just need to go away. Permanently. Got to meet some Strigoi–they are nasty pieces of work.

So, overall, I really liked Frostbite. Richelle Mead is consistent in how she writes and she writes well. I am looking forward to reading the next novel and finding out where all this leads. Content was great, plot was fantastic, and of course, I love the characters. I am giving Frostbite a 3.5/4 out of 5.

“In a world that seems saturated with vampire books, Richelle Mead has created characters and a world that is both unique and believable.”– TeensReadToo.com

Five hours. Total time it took to read Richelle Mead’s Vampire Academy. Incredibly quick read, but an incredibly good book. I could not put it down. Okay, I put it down a couple of times so I could move around. This might sound familiar, but I have never read a novel like it. It is different from what I have read and definitely different than the Blue Bloods series. I’m not going to lie–I love the idea that Montana (of all places) has a hidden area where vampire teens and their companions go to school.

Mead takes a different approach to vampires and their companions. The main character’s name is Rose Hathaway–half-human, half-vampire–a dhampir. Her best friend is Lissa Dragomir–a Moroi princess–Moroi being mortal vampires. In Mead’s world, there are two kinds of vampires: Moroi, good; Strigoi, evil. A dhampir’s purpose is to protect a Moroi royal. Personally, I’ve never heard of mortal vampires and vampire guardians–but I think it is fantastic!

Character development is very high in this novel–and as such, I hope so in the rest of the series. I am all for the relationships that are forming: Lissa/Christian and Rose/Dimitri. I look forward to future novels, partly for these couples, and partly because I like the plots. Lissa and Christian understand each other because they are the last in their line, everyone else has passed on. Then there is Rose and Dimitri. Hmm… Dimitri Belikov. I am not sure what is to happen with this pair, but I love them together! Don’t know why–maybe it is the older guy thing–the maturity and knowledge that younger males seem to… lack. Ahm. Anyway, the romantic relationships are not nearly as complicated in Vampire Academy as in the Blue Bloods series. Don’t get me wrong–love them both and really love the complications as an outside looking in–that’s it. 🙂

”’That’s part of it, ‘ he said. ‘But also… well, you and I will both be Lissa’s guardians someday. I need to protect her at all costs. If a pack of Strigoi come, I need to throw my body between them and her.'” (324)

I think I will introduce this series to my sister. That is, if she hasn’t already discovered them. So–I like Mead’s storytelling and characters. I’m giving Vampire Academy a 3.4/4 out of 5. I really wish I had come across this series earlier than now.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Error Codes)UE_ Top Loader

If the customer is calling regarding uE/UE displays after the recall you need to probe the issue a bit further to determine if service is necessary.Is your machine displaying a uE(lowercase""U"") or UE(uppercase""U"")?

A. ″uE″ or “UE” is informing customers that the sensor has detected unbalance of laundry. When the excessive unbalance of laundry occurs, a sensor detects unbalance of laundry. While the machine performs the process to rearrange and untangle unbalance of laundry. This display is appeared to inform the customer that “ When the excessive unbalance of laundry occurs, abnormal vibration can shorten the life of the washing machine, and even result in damage to the product. Please be careful to avoid the unbalance of laundry (Refer to the owner’s manual.)” (It occurs frequently when washing different kind of clothe, bulky items, such as waterproof sheet, shoes, mattresses, large dolls, etc.)

Q. What cycle was selected? Cotton/normal or heavy duty cycle?

Cotton/Normal or Heavy Duty cycle,If you use Cotton/Normal or Heavy duty cycle, it can happen easily. These two cycles are DOE cycles, meaning they provide energy savings according to the USA government requirement. As DOE Cycles, they use less water than other cycles. This requirement is same for all US energy star labeled washing machines.

* For models WT5860**/WT1701** : For this reason, we recommend “Power Cleanse"" cycle * For models WT5******/WT4***CW : For this reason, we recommend ""PermPress/Casual"" cycle. * For models WT1****** : For this reason, we recommend ""Pure color"" cycle. (If customer want to use cotton or heavy duty, recommends water plus or fabric softener option)

This cycle uses more water and a deep tub rinse, so better washing and rinsing performance. The deep tub rinse will give less UE or unbalance.(Deep rinse compared to Jet spray Rinse)

If you decide to continue to use Cotton/Normal, Sanitary, and Heavy Duty cycles. Adding the Fabric Softener Option to the cycle will change the Jet Spray Rinse to a Deep Rinse. This increase in water will help to better distribute the load during the rinse cycle which may result in fewer vibrations.

Other cycle : Proceed to unbalanced load or Leveling.

"Like mother, like daughter

WHITSETT — There have been times Stanford Smith couldn’t tell his daughter’s cooking from his wife’s. And that’s a compliment, seeing as both women have been honored as Times-News’ Cooks of the Month.

Stanford’s wife, Hasseena Smith, was Cook of the Month in September 2012, and his daughter, Kaamilya Furman, is Cook of the Month for April.

Kaamilya graduated from Johnson & Wales University in Charlotte last May. It was through her studies there that she gained the confidence to experiment with ingredients and concentrate on presentation.

“That’s what I love — the presentation,” she said. “You do, after all, eat with your eyes.”

When Kaamilya was a senior at Eastern Guilford High School, Kathy Jo Mitchell came to speak to her class about Johnson & Wales University. Mitchell’s talk, Kaamilya said, inspired her to attend the school. The tips and tricks she learned at the university have encouraged her to pursue a career in food services and strengthened her ability as a chef.

“She doesn’t play around when she’s in the kitchen,” Hasseena said. “She does well with properly putting a menu together and making sure each dish complements the next. Kaamilya has learned and taught me how to make some salad dressings and sauces from scratch with items we have here in our kitchen cabinets.”

Kaamilya, along with her mother, are on the hospitality committee at Clapp’s Chapel AME Church in Whitsett and prepared a meal on Feb. 24 to celebrate Heritage Day. Those in attendance wore African attire and Kaamilya and Hasseena made Jamaican Jerk Chicken, potato croquettes, green beans and baked chicken.

“Everyone really seemed to enjoy the food and complimented us on it,” Hasseena said.

During a recent visit to their home, Kaamilya prepared two of her mother’s favorite dishes, Bourbon chicken with homemade bourbon sauce and potato croquettes.

“They are so delicious,” Hasseena said, observing the preparation of the potato croquettes, or as she referred to them — “potato cakes.”

Both Hasseena and Kaamilya also prepare healthier versions of drinks and dishes because some family members have suffered from high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart disease. Kaamilya went to the cabinet and pulled out organic sugar, which she uses in recipes.

Kaamilya currently works at the Food Lion on Ramada Road in Burlington in the deli as a cashier and cake decorator; cake decorating was one of the skills she learned at Johnson & Wales.

When she’s not preparing food for others, though, Kaamilya described her food tastes as “plain Jane.” “I like simple foods, not fancy.”

Since she has such a passion for food, Kaamilya would like to be a caterer someday.

“I love watching others sample my food,” she said with a smile.

"POWER tycoon Paul Massara sparked an outrage after claiming energy bills are sky-high because British households waste energy.

THE £600,000-a-year boss of energy giants npower was condemned by hard-up families last night after saying they were to blame for sky-high bills.

Chief executive Paul Massara, whose company’s average 10.4 per cent winter price hike was the highest of the Big Six suppliers, sparked a storm of outrage when he claimed: “Bills are high because British homes waste so much energy.”

And instead of apologising to customers for the rises, the millionaire with a three-storey 16th century mansion said ordinary households had to do more to cut costs.

Scots mum-of-one Alison Lindsay, 35, said Massara was “seriously out of touch”. And the civil servant from East Kilbride said she and husband Mark, 41, already do all they can to keep their astronomical bills down.

Alison, who has an 18-month-old son, Jake, said of Massara: “We can’t afford to be flippant with our money and I think he has been very flippant with his comments.

“These people are obviously completely out of touch with people such as myself.

“ I would love to know the last time they personally sat down and consulted single parents, young families and pensioners over their needs and struggles.

“They are misguided and he has obviously lost touch with the average person, on an average salary with an average life.”

Daily Record

Alison Lindsay with son Jake

Pensioner Cathy Leach, 70, a retired postal worker from Glasgow, said: “Energy companies are dodging and diving, and once again trying to take the onus off them and all the fantastic perks they get.

“How dare they treat people with such contempt when they are struggling?

“I go around my house switching everything off in a panic, like most people do, because they know their bills are going to be sky-high.

“For an energy boss to say people are being wasteful is absolute rubbish. What planet is he on? If I’m told to put another cardigan on or wear a woolly hat in my house, I’ll scream.”

Mark Todd, co-founder of energyhelpline.com, said: “For an energy supplier to blame customers for rocketing bills beggars belief. Suppliers have raised prices by 140 per cent in nine years while users have cut usage.

“Typical gas usage is down 34 per cent and electricity usage by three per cent, in part because many customers can no longer afford to heat their homes.

“To blame bill rises on wasteful customers is thus totally incorrect. It’s the suppliers who have put up the bills, not the customers.”

Massara said: “The actual unit price of energy in the UK is one of the lowest in Europe, but bills are high because British homes waste so much energy.

“If we can increase the efficiency of the UK’s old and draughty housing, we can ensure that annual energy bills are some of the lowest too.”

The lights are on at npower boss Paul Massara's house

His comments come less than a week after our sister paper the Daily Mirror revealed that a fatcat who helped npower’s owners avoid millions in tax is now on the board of HM Revenue and Customs – advising the taxman.

Former npower boss Volker Beckers ran a tax avoidance operation in Malta which meant the firm paid no UK corporation tax for four years while bills rose by 55 per cent.

Caroline Flint MP, Labour’s Shadow Energy and Climate Change Secretary, said: “It’s hypocritical for energy companies like npower to blame households for ‘wasting’ energy and then lobby the Government to cut back on insulation schemes.

“If npower really want to help, they could always use some of their profits to improve the energy efficiency of their customers’ homes.

“If these companies want to win back customers’ trust they should admit they’ve been overcharging and back Labour’s price freeze, which will save money for 27million households and 2.4million businesses.”

And Gary Smith, national secretary for energy at the GMB union, said: “Npower are in crisis. They’re sacking thousands of workers across the UK, offshoring other jobs and their credit rating is going down the pan. Yet this company seem to think it is fine to use customers as a scapegoat for their problems.

“Some of the poorest people in this country live in private rented accommodation, yet there isn’t enough pressure on landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.

“But instead of trying to improve their lot, npower seem happy to blame them. They are a disgrace.”

Massara’s “don’t blame us” message over rising bills has been touted repeatedly by his company.

Npower have claimed more than half of Britain’s homes are wasting money by “allowing expensive heat to escape through walls and roofs”.

They said they controlled less than 20 per cent of customers’ bills, made “no hidden profits” and had a profit margin of 3.2 per cent in the first nine months of 2013.

They also complained that Government regulations on energy would add £308 to bills by 2020.

Their report, Energy Explained, was slammed by regulator Ofgem, who said it contained “incorrect and misleading” figures on the cost of the UK’s energy supply network.

In October, Massara claimed on the npower website that 84 per cent of the retail price of energy was “outside our control”.

The firm were then accused of censoring comments on the site from angry customers, one of whom told Massara he was “full of it”.

Npower have increased gas prices by 39.6 per cent, and electricity prices by 34.3 per cent, since October 2010.

They announced a 2.6 per cent price cut this month after the Government reduced green levies on bills. They were the last of the Big Six to agree to pass on the cuts.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"OpenDoc in Microsoft Office a Reality

The group has apparently been working on the plug-in for quite some time, however only publicly acknowledged it after the state of Massachusetts put out a request on Wednesday.

The request asked for information on a plug-in that would ""allow Microsoft Office to easily open, render, and save to ODF files, and also allow translation of documents between Microsoft's binary (.doc, .xls, .ppt) or XML formats and ODF.""

According to the OpenDocument Foundation, the plug-in would work for any version of Office from Office 97. Testing of the plugin has been completed by the group and no issues have arisen.

The group is now in the process of submitting the plug-in to the state through the proper channels, it told Groklaw in an interview Thursday.

While some may find the organization's moves as somewhat contradictory to its stated premise, OpenDocument Foundation's Gary Edwards does not.

This isn't about Windows, Edwards told Groklaw. ""It's about people, business units, existing workflows and business processes, and vested legacy information systems begging to be connected, coordinated, and re-engineered to reach new levels of productivity and service.""

""It's also about the extraordinary value of ODF and it's importance to the next generation of collaborative computing,"" he continued.

It is not clear if the group plans to make the plug-in publicly available.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Scientists Find New Way To Battle MRSA

by Sam Savage

Experts from Queen's University Belfast have developed new agents to fight MRSA and other hospital-acquired infections that are resistant to antibiotics. The fluids are a class of ionic liquids that not only kill colonies of these dangerous microbes, they also prevent their growth.

The development of these new antimicrobial agents was carried out by a team of eight researchers from the Queen's University Ionic Liquid Laboratories (QUILL) Research Centre. The team was led by Brendan Gilmore, Lecturer in Pharmaceutics at the School of Pharmacy, and Martyn Earle, Assistant Director of QUILL. The discovery is published in the scientific journal Green Chemistry.

Many types of bacteria, such as MRSA, exist in colonies that adhere to the surfaces of materials. The colonies often form coatings, known as biofilms, which protect them from antiseptics, disinfectants, and antibiotics.

Earle said: ""We have shown that when pitted against the ionic liquids we developed and tested, biofilms offer little or no protection to MRSA, or to seven other infectious microorganisms.""

Ionic liquids, just like the table salt sprinkled on food, are salts. They consist entirely of ions - electrically-charged atoms or groups of atoms. Unlike table salt, however, which has to be heated to over 800o C to become a liquid, the ionic liquid antibiofilm agents remain liquid at the ambient temperatures found in hospitals.

One of the attractions of ionic liquids is the opportunity to tailor their physical, chemical, and biological properties by building specific features into the chemical structures of the positively-charged ions (the cations), and/or the negatively-charged ions (the anions).

Earle said: ""Our goal is to design ionic liquids with the lowest possible toxicity to humans while wiping out colonies of bacteria that cause hospital acquired infections.""

Microbial biofilms are not only problematic in hospitals, but can also grow inside water pipes and cause pipe blockages in industrial processes.

Gilmore said: ""Ionic liquid based antibiofilm agents could potentially be used for a multitude of medical and industrial applications. For example, they could be used to improve infection control and reduce patient morbidity in hospitals and therefore lighten the financial burden to healthcare providers. They could also be harnessed to improve industrial productivity by reducing biofouling and microbial-induced corrosion of processing systems.""",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Interfaith

if you were in an interfaith relationship, how would you raise your children?

j(wh) and i have asked that question several times as we’ve discussed what the future may hold for us. and it will continue to be a topic of conversation, i’m sure. i have, from very early in our relationship, taken the stance that, if we were to marry and have children, our (hypothetical) children should be taught the beliefs and history of both of our faith traditions; that they should attend both quaker and mormon meetings regularly (not both every Sunday, but on some kind of split schedule); that they should have both quaker and mormon communities; and that ultimately they should decide for themselves (when they’re older than eight) which tradition works for them—or that neither works for them.

j(wh) sees the balance and fairness in such a suggestion, but he still has reservations about raising his children with any exposure to mormonism. primarily because he fears the ways in which mormonism could cause them pain—the pain and depression he’s seen me experience because of the church’s teachings about gender and marriage; the pain men and women close to us have felt as they’ve attempted to fit themselves into the mold the church prescribes; the pain some of our friends felt as they left the mormon community. he doesn’t want to expose his children to a belief system that can generate such deep psychological and spiritual hurt. and i do not blame him. in fact i agree with him. i don’t want my children exposed to such pain either.

while we haven’t resolved this particular problem, we both very much believe there is a middle ground—a way to teach our (hypothetical) children about both of our faith traditions while doing our best to control for teachings we believe are harmful. that middle ground is possible because j(wh) and i share deeply cherished values and we envision living those values in similar ways. in other words, while our formal faith traditions are different, our beliefs are very similar.

as we’ve discussed this question, j(wh) has asked me whether i know anyone who has raised their kids the way i’m suggesting we should raise our (hypothetical) children—half in the mormon church, half in another church. and i’ve had to say that, no—i don’t. so i went searching the bloggernacle for other people’s experiences, trusting i would find useful information. i was rather surprised at what i did find.

but i also found ideas that very much disturbed me. here’s a few, in brief:

that a woman will be ‘available’ to be sealed to a man in the next life, regardless of whether she stays single or marries a non-mormon. the implication being that were such a woman to marry a non-mormon, she would not be sealed to her non-mormon spouse.

that marriage to a non-mormon pre-supposes a ‘divorce-upon-death.’ again implying that it’s impossible for an interfaith marriage to be sanctioned in the next life.

that there should be a pre-nup understanding that the non-mormon spouse’s failure to actively support the LDS lifestyle would constitute sufficient grounds for divorce.

that a mormon marries a non-mormon out of desperation for sex and companionship.

that when a mormon marries a non-mormon, the mormon has settled for marrying someone who does not cherish the same values.

that marriage is about making babies, not about the spouses. that therefore, because marrying a non-mormon will jeopardize future children’s moral character, interfaith marriage should be avoided at all costs—even the cost of debilitating depression and loneliness.

that interfaith parents necessarily compete for control of their children’s moral training—because clearly they couldn’t have moral values in common.

that the children of interfaith marriages should, obviously, be raised exclusively mormon.

that marriage is teleological—about the ends achieved, rather than about the way life is lived now.

that mormons in interfaith marriages should be pitied, as if their marriages must be a daily burden instead of a source of joy and happiness.

that only mormons with serious testimony issues or rebellious natures marry outside the church.

that marrying a non-mormon constitutes a deliberate and active sin.

as i read these various posts and comments—literally hundreds of comments—i was stunned. and furious. and sad.

sad because essentially what i heard over and over was that interfaith marriage is inherently lacking; that it constituted sin; that it was begging for trouble. sad because of the lack of faith—faith that god will sanction any marriage built on love and equality and sound foundations, rather than just those begun with the proper ritual and form. i cannot understand the privileging of form (starting a marriage with a temple sealing) over principle (building a strong, loving, lasting marriage—a ‘celestial’ marriage, if you will). i cannot understand it in spite of my acceptance of the importance of saving ordinances.

my search for ideas about how to build interfaith marriages and families also took me to a couple of articles in dialogue. and it was there i found what felt right to me. in his short article “eternity with a dry-land mormon,”* levi peterson explains the rites of “baptism, confirmation, healing, and wedding” as ordained by god “for the comfort, not the condemnation, of human beings. a ritual is not a ticket allowing one to enter a certain door or gate. it is a reminder and a symbol; it concentrates meaning and rouses emotion” (113-4). this understanding of ordinances resonates with me. it makes sense to think of rites as focusing attention on living principled, examined lives while recognizing that they are not the only means of doing so.

peterson later concludes: “a wedding announces a marriage, celebrates it, establishes its hope and ideal, but doesn’t create it. the joy a couple has in one another’s presence creates their marriage. i therefore believe that, if god grants althea and me to participate in the miracle of the resurrection, he will also grant us the privilege of continuing our marriage. there will need be no other reason than that we have loved each other long and dearly” (115). i could not agree more fully. for me, love is the well-spring of the gospel. it is the power that should direct our daily lives. it is the hope i feel for myself and my world. love—not form—will lead to exaltation. form, ritual, ordinances can only help set expectations of love, focus attention on love; they cannot take love’s place.

because my own interfaith relationship is with a quaker, i read heidi hart’s article “householding: a quaker-mormon marriage”** with great interest. i appreciated her story of spiritually journeying away from mormonism into quakerism; of her and her husband’s efforts to not only preserve their marriage, but to use their divergent spiritual paths as an opportunity to strengthen their marriage. she speaks of a jewish creation story in which “god’s divinity is shattered into pieces at the beginning of the world. . . . that our job as human beings is to gather the pieces of goodness scattered all around us,” regardless of where they lay (142). i understand this vision because i see goodness everywhere in my world. i have no interest in making all of that goodness mormon, in redefining it so it fits neatly somewhere in the mormon cosmology. i am interested in exploring the goodness where it lays, in coming to understand how the goodness in mormonism and the goodness outside mormonism work together to make a beautiful world.

it is that desire, as much as any sense of fairness, that inspires my desire to raise (hypothetical) children with j(wh) as truly interfaith. i know it’s an unusual desire for a mormon. i know it will be a course with challenges. but i believe it can be done. because i believe that “it’s not our differences that divide us. it’s our judgments about each other that do” (150)**.

so why am i writing this post? i suppose i’m writing it in hopes that i’ll find some mormons who don’t agree with the crazy notions i encountered in the bloggernacle. more importantly i’m writing it hoping for thoughts about how to go about raising truly interfaith children. i don’t particularly want to repeat the extremely long, extremely hurtful discussion that happened at times & seasons a few years ago; which means that i’m not particularly interested in talking about whether a mormon should marry a non-mormon in the first place. the reality is that it happens. instead, i’m interested in ideas about how to go about building a strong, interfaith family (not just a mormon or a quaker family with one parent who believes differently).

Amelia has recently relocated to Salt Lake City for her new job selling college textbooks (a job she loves). She’s a 9th generation Mormon redefining her relationship with the church (the church she both loves and hates). She’s passionate about books, travel, beauty, and all things cheese.

In addition to her Dialogue article, you need to read Heidi Hart’s book, _Grace Notes_, about raising her family in an LDS/Quaker home (she’s Quaker, her husband is LDS, and their children are primarily LDS but also are a part of the Quaker community). She’s also done several Sunstone sessions on this topic that are available for download as mp3s.

2 things:
I am concerned about potential husband’s attitude towards your faith; if his primary reaction is fear of that faith because it causes pain, that seems to indicate a lack of support for you and your chosen religion.

Also, you seem a bit knocked off your feet with the idea that some LDS people (of course the vocal ones) will disapprove of your marriage. That is a fact, some people will. Why does it matter to you? It seems that if you were more at ease with the prospect, other people’s opinions would not matter.

I want to say that I think such an interfaith family could exist peacefully and happily, but I just don’t know if I have that much faith in the Mormon community. I wouldn’t trust them to not treat your kids as “the ones with the crazy parents”. Since my marriage is turning out to be a little more interfaith than I even expected, I would also like tips on how to handle it.

While at BYU, I took the missionary prep class taught by Randy Bott, and of all the many motivational things he said, the single thing I remember from that full semester is when he told the class that he would rather his daughters died than marry outside the temple. Such talk can be so damaging, where it creates the sense that non-temple marriage is evil and/or damning (in the sense that you will never be exalted). The conclusions in your bullet points are many times the result of such black and white declarations, which are, in the first place, only given as opinion.

I’m currently having a very hard time separating the important bits of doctrine from the actions of the church and its members, and the idea that my marriage is doomed for eternity if I don’t shape up and fix my beliefs doesn’t give me hope, it is heart wrenching. I would rather just concentrate on how much we love each other and are trying to make each others’ lives better while creating a loving family.

I agree with the poster who notes your husbands very negative view of the LDS faith; I would add that you also seem ambivalent at best about your religion. In light of your views, I do not agree with your idea of taking your children to both churches and “letting them choose”. Children need a spiritual foundation that they can build from, not competing ideas and mixed messages. I think you should raise them as Quakers if you truly believe that taking them to an LDS primary would cause them pain.

Amelia,
Thanks for this thoughtful post! I’m glad to have someone to share Mondays with 🙂
You hit the nail on the head when you asked about what an interfaith family would look like. It seems easy to talk about some kind of religious balance, but how that actually plays out can be much different. The devil’s in the details, I guess.
I’m not in the same situation, but I do think there are adjustments that families have to make as one of the parents becomes less (or non) believing in the LDS church. I think I’m on that path. Of course, starting out a marriage expecting the interfaith issue is a lot different than starting out in the temple and thinking you’ll both be on the same religious wavelength for the rest of your lives (and eternity).
I appreciate your research on this topic and it will be so helpful to refer people to this post in the future.
Best of luck in your journey.

Wow. I think some commenters are not focusing enough on how similar your beliefs are to j(wh). If you two believe in the same principles of kindness, charity, love, and equality, I think you can make it work.

Obviously there would be difficulties. It will get complicated when they learn in primary that only families that are sealed can be together forever. But like you, I think you can control for that. Tell them that that’s how some Mormon’s look at it, but others believe in God’s grace and love and that we’ll be with our loved ones in the hereafter. Give them the Quaker viewpoint on the subject. Ask them what’s the most compelling to them and why. I think this could lead to some wonderful discussions where the kids’ can learn to take the best from these two great religious traditions.

I also wanted to comment on how jaw droppingly awful it is to hear Mormon’s say they’d rather their children die than marry outside the church. Sarah, that was a horrific story. Also awful was that discussion on T&S that you linked too, Amy. I’m shocked that anyone could for a second think that no marriage is better than a great marriage to a non-Mormon. Absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. Would anyone really wish that on our friends and family? (Not that a single life can’t be great, but if someone has that chance to find a companion and have children, and that’s what he/she desires, good grief, how could you not see how potentially wonderful that marriage could be for them?)

I find it really sad that some Mo’s don’t have faith that God in all his infinite love won’t be completely compassionate and sympathetic towards those in interfaith marriages and ultimately ratify those marriages in the next life. Of courses, I am the product of an interfaith marriage, so maybe I’m biased.

Thank you for this thought provoking post, Amelia. It briefly reminded me of a conversation with my current home teacher. He knows that I am interested in women’s issues so he told me that he wrote his thesis on why Mormon women marry outside of the church. Unfortunately, most of his conclusions could be found in your bulleted points. He was none to pleased when I told him that I thought that his points did not fully explore the complexity of why many LDS women choose to marry non-members.

I am a firm believer that each couple must develop a theology that they will teach to their children. All couples do this regardless of whether they are interfaith or devout Mormons; we all pick and choose portions of the doctrine that are very important to us and overlook things that are not.

This is something that my husband and I are currently working on. There are several aspects of Mormon doctrine and culture that are profoundly hurtful to me and I must say that I have the same fears that j(wh) has expressed. In order to assuage some of my reservations, DH and I are working towards a theology of our own to give to our children. Personally, I think this is one of the greatest gifts you can give your children, a belief system that you have deeply explored and are committed to living and sharing.

Why does this conversation have to be limited to interfaith relationships? Parents will have their biases and, I would imagine, it would easier if they shared those biases, but let’s be honest: even in monofaith relationships, the individual parents are unlikely to have the exact same interpretations of the faith. If I were a parent, I would explore as many faiths, perspectives, and community as I could with my children, because not only would I want them to find their own truth, but I want to expose them to diversity–not only for the sake of being able to learn the impotency of discrimination, but also to find those golden areas that all faiths teach: compassion, love, respect, etc.

But of course faith is more than just values, right? It is also about community. I don’t have a good personal answer for how I would deal with this as a parent, but what I do know is that if I loved and chose to marry someone of a different faith-perspective than my own, there comes the implicit understanding that for any harm that the faith and faith community she comes from must be balanced with the fact that it also made her who she is–and I simply have to respect that to some level. Maybe it’s because the faith instilled good values; maybe it’s because the hurt and struggle made her learn good lessons; likely, it is both and more. But how does that translate to the children?

I have to go back to my original point, though: it may be magnified in an interfaith relationship, but these issues of values, faith, and community are something I believe all parents must struggle with.

I don’t know if this is way off base with the questions you’ve asked in your post and with the other comments here, but it occurred to me today as I was thinking of you and J(wh) and contemplating your relationship. What I’m wondering is do you, Amelia, have enough faith?

I mean, do you have enough faith in J(wh) as someone who will be a loving and righteous husband? Do you have enough faith in yourself to be the spouse that he deserves? Do you have enough faith that the two of you together can weather the challenges that will come when your kids come home from LDS church repeating some racist folklore? Do you have enough faith in a God who loves you and who wants you to be happy? Do you have enough faith to deal with the hurtful and pitying comments from LDS members about part-member families? Do you have enough faith to step into the unknown without the support of your family and your church community?

I know you have the gumption to do all of this–you are one of the most strong-willed people that I know. But having faith and having gumption are not necessarily the same thing.

i appreciate the concern ESO and E expressed, but i feel like i must not have communicated the nuances of my situation well. so a couple of things to clarify:

1. j(wh)’s fear regarding mormonism has to do with raising children mormon; not with my own involvement in it. he supports me in my chosen religion and my practice of it and i think he always will. he has no desire to change the way i believe because he recognizes that it’s not his place to change the way i believe.

2. i couldn’t care less what other random mormons think about my relationship with or my potential marriage to j(wh). what upset me about what i found on the bloggernacle was not anticipation of others responding to me in that way–i have a very thick skin and pretty often dismiss the stupid things i hear people say at church (and everywhere else). what shocked me was that people actually think these things. at all. they’re so clearly not in keeping with the peace and charity and compassion and mercy and love of christ’s gospel, that i have a hard time understanding how people can think them. such thoughts have never even occurred to me.

3. i’m not ambivalent about my religion. but i do believe that every individual has their own particular understanding of religion. i’m very passionate about my understanding of my religion and i live it fully. the thing is that my personal version of my religion very much aligns with many of j(wh)’s beliefs and values. so i don’t think our children will be without a foundation. quite to the contrary, i believe they’ll have an even more solid foundation than many traditionally raised mormon children. because i won’t simply trust that all the random mormons who teach my kids in primary, sunday school, YW/YM, and seminary think the same way i do. if anything, i think the difference in our religious beliefs will make j(wh) and i more involved and proactive about shaping our (hypothetical) children’s moral and spiritual foundation than the average mormon family.

and i’m not married to him yet. though i want to marry him someday. 🙂

sarah: i understand and share your concern about the openness of the mormon community. i would hope that a faith community would not be so petty in how it responds to others, but i know i can’t really expect that. i suppose i respond to the concern in a couple of ways. 1. trying to be in touch enough with my kids that i hear about such instances; and 2. making sure that my kids have a diverse enough community that when some freaky mormon makes them feel bad because they’re from a part-member family or because they’re black or whatever, they’ll realize that those individuals aren’t like the other people in their larger community.

and i think randy bott’s statement about his daughters being better off dead than married outside the temple is utterly unconscionable. what a truly awful thing to say.

as for your last concern–about separating the opinions/behavior of church members from doctrine, i think you should read levi peterson’s article i referenced. if you go here:

caroline: thanks for calling attention to the importance of shared values. i think it’s such a mistake to believe that if two people don’t share a religion, they therefore don’t share beliefs and values and morals. nothing could be further from the truth. why would two people get married if they didn’t share those things?

and i like your idea of talking to kids about beliefs. i realize that to a certain extent that’s an idealized vision of how things can be. but at the same time i think we far too often sell short our children and their ability to think and consider and understand truth.

mraynes and jessawhy: i appreciate your calling attention to the fact that any set of parents must navigate the differences between their beliefs. i really think it’s a mistake for a couple to assume they’re on the same wavelength in terms of spiritual and religious beliefs simply because they’re both mormon. no marriage is without its challenges in terms of reconciling different beliefs and understandings. while those differences may be more apparent in an interfaith marriage, i don’t think that necessarily means they’re insurmountable. it could, in fact, mean they’re more workable (as long as the two partners are willing to do the work) since they’re more visible.

okay, so after that long comment, a little more. do put up with me a bit longer. 🙂

isaac: i really appreciate your comment and completely agree with you about every marriage requiring a negotiation of differing beliefs. and i really like your suggestion about exposing children to a wide variety of religions. i’ve thought about that–going to visit another church every once in a while–as a means of removing some of the potential for competition between our two religions. you know–letting children know that there are many ways people experience the divine. and that many of them do have the kinds of commonalities you identify.

in addition to community, i think faith is also about history and heritage. maybe those things are caught up in ‘community.’ but i just keep coming back to the fact that even if i were to stop practicing mormonism (which i don’t envision ever happening), i’d still be mormon. it’s part of me.

jana: the simple answer is yes. i have the purest, strongest faith i’ve ever experienced in j(wh), in myself, and in god. i could not experience the peace and joy that i am experiencing in this relationship if i didn’t. even when j(wh) and i have had difficult conversations about this (and other topics), i continue to experience that peace and trust. it’s incredible. and beautiful.

I am in a very similar situation to you where I am LDS and the boyfriend (hopefully future husband) is not. Except for I very recently converted to my religion, while my boyfriend remains mainline/liberal Protestant. Like j(wh), J (my boyfriend) is concerned about exposed our (hypothetical) kids to mormonism. He’s afraid that some things that the church teaches are damaging – and I agree. But many of the things the church teaches are wonderful! The question is, can kids filter out the bad and embrace the good like I do as an adult? Not without guidance.

If I had the perfect interfaith family (though nothing ever goes to plan) I would teach them both my and J’s religions and treat them equally. I would be very careful to discuss what the kids heard in primary, and to modify any damaging ideas that they received. This should be repeated with J’s religion. J thinks that it’s best that a family is united in faith and only attends one church. I think that it’s perfectly fine to attend two church services and let the kids decide when they are old enough.

Most importantly, before I build an interfaith family, I and J must be a truly interfaith couple. He and I need to fully respect and accept each other’s religion. We must be able to say, “I love you and I want to be a part of anything that is important to you. Teach me about your beliefs. I’ll listen with an open heart and only ask questions to clarify things.” I would like J to take lessons from the missionaries, and if/when he joins a church in his new city, I’ll participate in the new member class. J and I aren’t to this point yet, but I believe that once we are, the issues around raising children in an interfaith marriage will diminish greatly.

So it’s a struggle and I know J is upset that I’ve joined a church without him – especially a church that he would not choose for himself. We talk talk talk about it, and I try not to get upset about it. It’s one thing to go into a relationship where you know that you’ll be an interfaith couple, and it’s quite another to make that change in the midst of it all.

ps – I know it’s hard, but ignore those crazy, hurtful things people write on the internet. Just look into your heart and you’ll know what’s right. 🙂

I find it ironic and sad that this post–calling for tolerance and love–has prompted a string of comments so critical and dismissive of Randy Bott and those who share his view on this topic.

Amelia, it sounds like you and j(wh) are working this through and are in a good place to build the type of family you envision. Certainly it is possible to build a loving, successful interfaith family–I know many such families!

On the other hand, an interfaith family is not what everyone wants–I know, because it’s not what I want. For me, my choice is to stay single until I have the opportunity for a temple marriage (and yes, I realize that’s no magic guarantee, that any type of marriage requires a huge amount of work, etc.). I feel so strongly about that for myself that I’m certain I will feel the same way about my children–isn’t it only natural that a parent wants the same things for their children that they want for themselves? Of course I can’t speak for Randy Bott, but I suspect that’s somewhere along the lines of where he is coming from–I think it is *because* he cares about his daughters that he says what he does, not because he wants to cause them pain. Can’t we give him a break? I think this church is big enough for all of us, and the Botts, too.

This is a hard one. That is why you cant find much. I think each individual marriage has to find for themselves how it works.

My husband decided he was done with the church on Sunday. It is hard on a marriage to not be on the same page. It is hard when each of you want to teach your kids different things. I was shocked when he asked if this meant I would leave him. I dont think it is that simple. I told he no way. I love him and we have a good marriage.

Where we go from here I am not sure. We both love our children and want the best for them. We both agree that Christ’s teaching are something they need and if they following those teaching it will help them in their lives. How this all comes about will happen one step at a time.

I will not force my children. So some of it is up to them and what they choose. I just want to encourage them to be good people who are kind to others and make choices that will keep them from many of the pains you can experience when choosing to sin.

It is hard because I know there will be have to be compromises on both sides. Compromises on things I thought I would never compromise on.

Good luck to you. I know the Lord loves all of us and in the end if we look for His direction on behalf of our children. He will guide us in what they will need.

sunlize: thanks for sharing your experience. i think you’re right that it’s important that each partner respect the other’s beliefs. without that, i doubt an interfaith marriage/family could work. the concern about making a change of religion after a relationship has begun reminds me of some of what i read about mormon couples in which one partner left the church. the situation is a little different, but some of the feelings are the same. it might be helpful to read some of what’s available about those experiences. good luck.

melanie2: i appreciate your comment, also. of course there’s room in the church for all kinds of perspectives, including yours–i.e., preferring to remain single until you have the opportunity to marry in the temple.

i want to be very clear that my comment about randy bott’s attitude has nothing to do with either 1. preferring to remain single oneself until one can marry in the temple; or 2. preferring temple marriage for one’s children.

my own parents prefer that i marry in the temple. that has caused some difficult conversations between them and me. but while my parents feel very strongly about how important it is that i marry in the temple, they also recognize that i am the only one who can receive revelation about who and how i marry. so they accept that i should be the one to make that choice, regardless of their view.

what i find unconscionable in randy bott’s reported statement is not his preference that his children marry in the temple–not hoping his children have the same blessing he have. what’s unconscionable, in my opinion, is that his expression of that desire (i’d rather they die than marry outside the temple) proscribes his children’s right to revelation for themselves about who to marry. it implies an inability to accept and love one’s own children regardless of whether they make the same decisions one made for oneself. and it reinforces all of the misinterpretations of the church’s teaching about marriage that i listed in my post.

i agree that we should tolerate all kinds of perspectives and ideas in the church. i especially think that on the issue of marriage. but i do not think we should tolerate hyperbolic statements that imply such violence to other people’s (even our own children’s) spiritual autonomy. i realize that what inspired his comment was likely a desire that his children have the same blessing he has had and a conviction that sealing is vital. but in my mind those feelings do not justify the mode of expression he chose. i’m a firm believer that language has power beyond the intent behind what’s spoken. and i believe we have a responsibility to use that power carefully. i don’t think we should tolerate careless use of langague.

gladtobeamom: thank you so much for sharing your own experience. i’ve watched friends navigate the situation you find yourself in and i know it can be difficult. but i also know it can be done.

i’m glad that, in spite of the difference of opinion over what church to participate in, you and your husband recognize where you have the same desires for your children–teaching them about christ and his gospel. in such situations i think recognizing that you still have common ground and similar hopes for your children must be a vital beginning point. i’m sure that, while your new course will present challenges, you’ll be able to maintain your good marriage and be good parents as long as you act in love, as it sounds like you have.

as for resources: you might take a look at faces east (i linked to it in my post). there was some good conversation there. and i really thought heidi hart’s article was a great look at a marriage in which one partner left mormonism. that article is not available online, but i could mail you a photocopy of it if you’d like. email me at whilikers at hotmail dot com if you’re interested. she also has a book which would be a bit easier to find–grace notes. jana mentioned it above.

Amelia – You make a great point about the power of language and our responsibility in using it carefully. But I don’t think Bott is advocating violence, spiritually or otherwise. I see a major difference between “I would rather my daughter die than do X” and “I will kill my daughter if she contemplates doing X.” Nor did his statement say anything about how he would actually treat a daughter who chose contrary to his wishes for her, or how he would respond to her if she told him that she felt prompted to do something he disagreed with.

I took Bott’s mission prep class years ago, and while I don’t remember the specifics (or if this particular marriage discussion ever came up that semester), I know that the class as a whole did focus on the importance of agency, personal revelation, etc. Putting myself in his shoes, teaching a roomful of prospective missionaries, my priority would be getting them to focus on worthy preparation–and I think it’s pretty clear that the temple is major part of that. It may well be that making such a dramatic statement about the value of the temple–suggesting that anything less would be unthinkable for his daughters–was the best way to grab the attention of a bunch of 18-year-old boys.

You make a great point about the power of language and our responsibility in using it carefully. But I don’t think Bott is advocating violence, spiritually or otherwise.

I disagree with your view on the nuance of this wording. If I say, “I’d rather you die than make this choice,” it draws a clear line in the sand about my preferences. It says, quite clearly and dramatically, “this choice is more important to me than your life.”

j(wh), I would see that differently because that would be you addressing me directly. (As you said in your example, “I’d rather *you* die…”). As far as we know, he was actually talking to a classroom of students, not to the daughter(s) in the position of making the choice. To me that makes the statement more categorical–in the same vein as other general preferences about how people live their lives. I think it’s possible to have very strong views about religious beliefs, politics, values, etc., and express those, and yet still treat those who disagree with us with love and respect (for them and for their agency).

As far as tolerance of the intolerant goes–isn’t that what tolerance really is? It’s easy to deal with those with whom we agree; the difficulty is in tolerating those who annoy us. (Which I fully admit is one of my major faults!)

Amelia, I’m sorry I’ve taken us so far off-track…I’ll step aside from the threadjack now.

i don’t think bott is advocating violence; i think he’s committing violence against his daughters’–and others’–spiritual autonomy when he makes a statement like that. i understand that such statements are rhetorically powerful–that they will in fact gain and hold attention, so much that they will be remembered long after the moment in which they are spoken. which increases the amount of violence they commit.

why do i insist they commit violence against others’ spiritual autonomy? because those words–like most of the attitudes i encountered in the bloggernacle re: interfaith marriage–constitute an unjust and unwarranted exercise of force; because they do damage to others through distortion. (definitions of violence pulled from dictionary.com)

no matter how pure bott’s intent was when he uttered those words, the fact is that they distort gospel principles. and they exert power over others–because they become mental and spiritual barriers to an individual making their own choice regarding marriage.

why do i keep talking about bott’s statement? because i don’t think doing so is actually much of a threadjack. most of my bulleted points are, in spirit, very much like bott’s comment. and i believe that bott’s comment–as well as most of the bulleted points–violate tenets of the gospel.

is it really preferable that an individual’s mortal opportunity to grow through experience, to repent of previous problems, to make the most use possible of the time god has given us on earth be cut short rather than that she/he marry outside the temple? i just cannot reconcile that with my understanding of the gospel. how does the notion that it’s better to never experience the deep love and commitment of marriage and parenting than to marry outside the temple work given the gospel’s emphasis on love? is it really better to die young, having not had the many various opportunities life gives to love others, than to marry outside the temple?

the thought simply boggles my mind. i understand preferring to marry in the temple oneself; i understand preferring that one’s children marry in the temple; i do not understand preferring one’s children die rather than marry outside the temple.

i know some would justify that last preference by arguing that the next life is a drastic improvement on this life. but i stand by my first paragraph of questions here. i cannot understand why, if this life is necessary as a period in which we grow in ways necessary for our eternal progression, it’s ever preferable that someone die. the peace of the next life may be a means of reassuring ourselves about the inevitable loss of a loved one, but i cannot understand it as a justification for preferring that loved one die rather than _________ (insert whatever un-ideal, but still fulfilling choice you’d like there).

thus my astonishment and my anger when i read the various comments i listed in my post. i simply cannot understand the kinds of attitudes that cannot recognize that in the absence of the ideal, a situation that is still incredibly wonderful is a good thing.

and quite frankly, i don’t think temple marriage is the ideal. i think a strong, loving, growing marriage is the ideal. i think that starting a marriage with a temple sealing may help in the pursuit of that ideal. but i also believe that ideal can be pursued outside the bonds of temple sealing.

one more quick thing: i think this kind of comment (like bott’s)–so exclusive and thoughtless in the effort to drive home a point so thoroughly that the listeners would be manipulated into accepting it–is one of the kinds of things that causes j(wh) to fear raising his (hypothetical) children within mormonism. please do correct me if i’m wrong, j(wh).

it’s certainly one of the things i vehemently dislike about mormonism.

Amelia,
Yes, of course a strong, loving, growing marriage is possible outside of the temple. I agree, and I never meant to imply otherwise. That’s exactly the type of marriage I want, but I also want the temple aspect. I won’t move forward with a relationship unless both components are there–I hope it’s clear that I’m not advocating a temple marriage for its own sake if love, respect, growth, and so on are not also present.

My own decision (to remain single until that type of marriage, in the temple, is possible) is the result of very specific personal revelation. I would not deny anyone’s privilege to receive exactly the opposite prompting and to act on it.

On the other hand, as important as agency and personal revelation are, I don’t think it is inappropriate for the church (and thus, the body of members)to have an institutional preference for marriage to other members, in the temple. Indeed, I think it would be absurd to have the doctrine that we have about the temple, eternal families, and so on, and then not privilege those ordinances.

That type of preference can, I believe, extend to religion professors at BYU or to parents, and I simply disagree that having a general preference is problematic or manipulative. Hyperbolic statements expressing that opinion are just that: hyperbolic. In my mind, over-the-top is not necessarily manipulative.

Unfortunately, I’m afraid there will always be those in the church who do make ill-advised, rude, and judgmental comments about others’ choices. (By this point, you may think I’m one of them, though you’ll just have to trust me that that is not my intent at all.)

Certainly some of those bullet points you listed are incredibly hurtful and demeaning. Still, I do see how some of those points stem from real gospel principles (albeit with strong doses of zeal and judgment), so I don’t see them as having the same violent quality that you seem to see.

I get the sense–though please correct me if I’m wrong–that you and I disagree on the nature of Mormonism and what it encompasses. I think our differing perspectives have a lot to do with how we see comments such as Bott’s so differently.

I hesitate to start picking apart those bullet points, but to give one example: one point suggests that a member marrying a non-member has married someone who does not share the same values. Whether or not that might be true in a given case depends greatly on what we consider to be “values.” Values like love, charity, compassion, forgiveness, integrity, faith, humility, repentance, etc. obviously transcend Mormonism. But what of temple ordinances and eternal families? What about the church’s teachings about the nature of God, the authority of the priesthood, the divine origins of the Book of Mormon and latter-day revelation? Surely those principles/beliefs–which I include in my own definition of values–do not extend to most non-members. What that difference in beliefs means to any specific relationship will vary, but I think that distinction between “values” is real for a significant number of members. Thus, you can see your values as identical to j(wh)’s, while others might think–based on their different definition–that your values are different, or at least only partially aligned.

Given what I perceive as our conflicting views, what do you say we agree to disagree?

agreeing to disagree is often a wonderful thing. 🙂 and i don’t at all think you’ve made rude or inappropriate comments, melanie–you’ve maintained a perfectly appropriate tone throughout and i genuinely appreciate your perspective. what good are these conversations if they don’t include multiple perspectives?

i agree that the church as a whole, and its members as a body, should express a preference for mormons marrying in the temple. i have no problem with that. my problem is with the kinds of exclusionary and (in my opinion) unjustifiable extensions of that.

i completely understand your point about differing understandings of what constitutes “values.” i’m sure you’re right in surmising that a large part of our disagreement over some of these things stems from different understandings of what constitutes a “value” and of our different perspectives on mormonism. i readily admit that my perspective on mormonism is a little heterodox (though i don’t think it’s unorthodox).

what i would hope is that we all have charity when it comes to looking at other people and their choices. which, to my mind, means someone assumes, as a default, that two people who choose to marry each other do in fact have values in common, rather than assuming that such commonality is impossible simply because that person couldn’t imagine such a thing for him/herself (just one example).

i try very diligently to look at others’ choices with charity, assuming they act with integrity and good intent. heaven knows i don’t always succeed. but i do try. i would hope others would, too. but when i read an entire conversation of nearly 400 comments in which the kinds of attitudes i listed above are expressed ad infinitum ad nauseum–well i get a little discouraged. and a little angry.

Thanks for your response. I wish you the best in your relationship with this wonderful man. I think you have a very challenging situation; it’s hard for me to see a solution that doesn’t seem likely to cause conflict. I’ve certainly seen many successful interfaith marriages, but never one where one or both partners think the other person’s church is a threat they need to protect their children from. I would consider professional counseling to help the two of you come to specific agreement about exactly what you will teach your children, before you decide to have them. As it stands, it still seems to me that raising them as Quakers may be the way to go.

thanks for your good wishes, E. and i agree with you re: counseling. but then, i think pre-marriage counseling is a good idea for just about any couple. it’s something i think is too often overlooked in our church. i know couples go through a series of interviews with their bishop/stake president, but from what i understand i don’t think those interviews involve the kind of counseling one would get from a professional.

For some reason I feel compelled to add my support to amelia’s stance that a statement like “I’d rather my daughters were dead than married outside the temple.” I can only think how I would feel having that comment spoken by my own father in a public environment full of strangers. I think it is highly inappropriate. If he is comfortable saying that, he should be comfortable enough to say to my face, “I would rather you die than marry outside the temple.” I do not think passive threats like that belong anywhere in a father-daughter relationship.

Also, being in an interfaith relationship myself, I couldn’t help but go through the laundry list you posted, amelia, and I am saddened. I feel like I’m going to have to grow a thicker skin.

In personal experience, I remember the feeling of trying to squish myself into the image of what I thought the Mormon men I dated were looking for. In the last couple years, I’ve let go and decided to be myself. That allowed me to be open to relationships outside the church, and I’m happier than I’ve been in a long time.

I realized I didn’t finish this thought: For some reason I feel compelled to add my support to amelia’s stance that a statement like “I’d rather my daughters were dead than married outside the temple,” is nothing but harmful.

First, I apologize for using the name of the person who made the comment. That was completely irrelevant to the discussion, and is just the sort of thing I would normally find irritating, since it has the possibility of coloring people’s opinion of the speaker, religion classes at BYU, BYU itself, etc., etc. Perhaps Melanie2 had a great experience in that class, and perhaps the offending statement was not made during the time she took it. My bringing up who said it was construed as a criticism of the speaker, and his name just should have been left out. I guess I just wanted to emphasize that this sort of thing goes on in the mainstream church, even at “The Lord’s University”.

I also cannot help but disagree that the statement was made in a passive or hyperbolic sense. Every kid in that classroom heard it, and reacted some way. Maybe some nodded with agreement, knowing in their hearts that their parents also would rather see them dead that married outside the temple. Maybe some made the decision on the spot to only marry in the temple, only to ignore promptings later on to get involved with someone who was a good person, but not a member. Using the temple as a measuring stick, to me, can express doubt in the plan of salvation, which includes the ability for people to change, to repent, to accept the gospel, to be sealed in the temple after 20 years of happy marriage. In that way, the exclusionary view of the temple being the only viable option other than death can hurt both the people who have made that choice, and those who will never be touched by them because of the choice.

Which is not at all to say that I don’t respect people who do wish to be married there. I just wish people would see that it’s not the end of the world if they don’t. It’s not a sin, it won’t necessarily cause unhappiness, it’s not a sure road to divorce. I also wish that when someone makes the decision to marry elsewhere, their friends and family members and acquaintances from church would embrace the decision and the new family member, without recrimination at a choice that would not have been their own, or hurtful or pitying comments, or talking to others with that whispered emphasis “they didn’t get married in the temple… gasp!” as if it were somehow evil.

zenaida: i understand the frustration with trying to fit expectations when one is dating. i don’t think i did it very often. but it hurt that the expectations were there. which sounds odd. i k now that dating is always a process of finding someone who meets expectations on some level. but mormon dating feels more pressured than that–like people always come to dating with this preconceived notion of what a spouse should be and they immediately start measuring the other person against that ideal. i’m sure non-mormons do it, too. but in my experience dating non-mormons, it’s been so much more about exploring and discovering who the other person is, rather than measuring them against a checklist. which seems so much more healthy.

and you’re right. the peaceful assurance does come with time. i didn’t have it early on. and because i didn’t, j(wh) and i are lucky i made it to date 4. 🙂

and sarah–thank you for your comment. especially the last paragraph. a marriage should always be a time for celebration and joy. for family or friends to be more focused on their own disappointed expectations than on their loved one’s joy simply seems wrong on so many levels.

“interested in exploring the goodness where it lays, in coming to understand how the goodness in mormonism and the goodness outside mormonism work together to make a beautiful world.”

That seems like a great goal — drawing from the good in both traditions.

“i don’t particularly want to repeat the extremely long, extremely hurtful discussion that happened at times & seasons a few years ago; ”

I’m sorry that you found that thread hurtful, Amy. As someone who commented on that thread, I’m not sure what to make of that reaction. The thread essentially consisted of Julie saying that interfaith marriages are inherently bad, followed by every other bloggernacle regular who commented — Russell, Lisa, Melissa, me, even Adam Greenwood — telling her that she was wrong. She even called herself “the cheese standing alone” by the end of comments. It seemed pretty clear that Julie’s position (interfaith = bad) was the outlier.

“Amelia,
Thanks for this thoughtful post! I’m glad to have someone to share Mondays with :)”

Wait — you share Mondays? So I have to wait 2 weeks for Jess, and 2 weeks for Amy? Grumble.

“While at BYU, I took the missionary prep class taught by Randy Bott, and of all the many motivational things he said, the single thing I remember from that full semester is when he told the class that he would rather his daughters died than marry outside the temple. ”

A stupid, bullshit attitude that’s unfortunately not uncommon. Or at least, people say it. I don’t know if they’d _actually_ prefer a dead child. Either way, it’s an awful way to try to make a rhetorical point.

Kaimi,
I haven’t read the T&S thread Amy is referring to, but I’ve always found your comments to be very tolerant and supportive.
Thanks, btw, for looking forward to my posts, but I am running out of angst to blog about. (well, that’s not exactly true, running out of time is more like it)

You’ll be so delighted (as my 5 yo would say) to hear that MRaynes is sharing a spot on Mondays as well. (I think the schedule is MRaynes, Jess, Amy, Jess)
We’re really excited to have her blogging with us.

I do understand the real life constraints, though. My own blogging goes inevitably in cycles, depending on real life.

“You’ll be so delighted (as my 5 yo would say) to hear that MRaynes is sharing a spot on Mondays as well. (I think the schedule is MRaynes, Jess, Amy, Jess)
We’re really excited to have her blogging with us.”

Hey, that is good. I like MRaynes’s comments. And you women have a good track record at adding new bloggers.

Well, it may have started out kinda sketchy, what with the unipedal, camera-wielding maniac and “no flower unphotographed.” But it’s gone well enough since then, and . . . hey, stop hitting me!

i found it hurtful because even in the face of so much thoughtful, reasonable explanation why marrying outside the temple is not the end of the world, julie (and others) continued to hammer on the same point over and over. and to do so in an incredibly callous way that showed absolutely no consideration for anyone else’s experience. and i heard in that the voice of the mormon mainstream. and it’s hurtful to me that that mainstream could be so thoughtless about a person’s feelings. that they could dismiss a marriage as sinful or misguided or bound to destroy children when, for the two people (getting) married, it’s actually a source of great joy.

i very much appreciated all of the efforts at reasoned and thoughtful counterargument. but none of them made any difference to julie.

i don’t really care what other people think of my relationship. not in a way that would allow their thoughts to shape my choices. but, being a human being and therefore a social animal, i of course would like my family and community to recognize and celebrate the joy and happiness i’ve experienced in my relationship. to realize that instead that community will deem it sinful or misguided or destructive–well that hurts, even if it won’t affect my choices re: the relationship. though it may affect where i choose to find community.

it’s one of the reasons that, if i do marry outside the temple, i will not have a mormon bishop/stake president perform the ceremony.

One thing that I’ve never understood is why so many Mormons think that it’s like THE END if you marry a non-member, that you’re throwing away your eternal salvation, etc, etc. I’m married to a non-member. It hasn’t always been easy, but I don’t regret it because it was the right decision for ME. (You can find out why if you read the posting called “The Marriage Mission” on my blog.) We’re a church who actually believes in the opportunity of sorting out details in the hereafter through proxy during mortal life, whether through baptism for the dead or sealings. So the way I look at it, even if we both die being only civilly married, why can’t someone in this life do my husband’s temple work and have us sealed, including any children we may have someday? He might not accept it in this life, but maybe he will in the next. Who knows? Anyone who says that’s not a possibility is contradicting a fundamental Mormon belief. Or am I wrong?

amelia, I’ve never attended a wedding in which a member and a non-member were married. I tend to agree with you that I would not have a bishop perform a ceremony like that for me, but I’m not sure where that comes from. I have this sense that it would not be the joyful celebration I would want it to be.

i’ve attended a handful, zenaida. and the thing that always struck me was that there seemed to be this emphasis on the fact that the marriage ended at death. i’m not sure why it struck me that way. it could just be a factor of having been raised thinking about eternal marriages and knowing that the wedding i witnessed didn’t begin an eternal marriage–not in mormon terms. having been raised in the mormon church i am conditioned to feel that way, just like so many others. i’m sure that’s part of it.

but i’m sure it’s not the entirety of it. i’ve also always been struck by the absence of celebration during these ceremonies. they’re very short. the vows can’t be changed at all by any of the participants. i don’t know. they just don’t feel celebratory. in contrast to the weddings of non-members i’ve been to. i was at one last month and it was beautiful. a joyous celebration of these two people’s love for each other. and i think that it was that way in large part because they, as a couple, were able to shape the ceremony as they wanted it to be. which i like.

I think a lot depends on the individual bishop and his personality. My bishop at the time was actually a huge help in helping me make the decision to get married in the first place. I was very torn because I also was born and raised in the Church and although my parents didn’t raise me with the mindset that I had to get married in the temple, we all know that it’s everywhere in Mormon culture. So, I was actually very surprised when my bishop was nothing but encouraging, taking the time to fast and pray with me until I felt it was right, and then performing the ceremony. My husband and I were the ones who wanted it very minimal and simple, but the bishop gave a wonderful “sermon” on love, marriage, and although he talked about the possibility of temple marriage (which I didn’t object to), I never got the feeling he was looking down upon us for marrying outside the temple. Everyone who attended the wedding, including many non-members, were thoroughly impressed by him. I was also especially impressed that he didn’t use the line “until death do you part,” but rather “for as long as you both shall live.”

So I have no regrets about getting married in the chapel by the bishop. I wouldn’t have wanted to invite the whole ward, but that’s just the way I am. I only needed those around me who I knew cared about us and had our best interests at heart.

I’m a child of a part-member family, and currently a young single adult in the church. We were raised catholic (my father’s faith), but with a great deal of exposure to my the LDS church (the faith of my mother, who is incidentally one of two members of an RS stake presidency whose husbands are not members).

When I joined the church, as a 20-year old, despite years of obvious interest in the church, it was a problem. My Dad tried very hard to convince me not to. I know it caused a series of very difficult fights between my parents. My father now objects to my mom paying tithing on her income–something that was not true in the past–will no longer come to church with my mom on special occasions–which he did in the past–and often objects when there are ‘too many mormons’ coming to visit (not missionaries, vt’s or ht’s, just my mom’s friends). So long as we kids weren’t interested, he was fine with her participation, was fine with the church. Once I joined, everything changed. So, based on your representation of your boyfriend, and those of the person representing themselves as your boyfriend, you need to be sure that his acceptance of the church in your life will extend to the eventuality of your children’s enthusiastic membership; the representations of him give me pause that this would be the case.

More generally, do you care if your kids make gospel including the priesthood, part of their lives? Because the odds are that they won’t if you follow this course, just because this often happens in families where the are religious divides–it’s evident in my own family–I’m LDS, one sister is catholic, and the third is entirely uninterested in religion. Which has provided lots of heartache for both parents, as they have both sought for us to believe in things they deeply believe in. I don’t know you, but perhaps this is ok with you–the church does not seem to be the first place you look for your beliefs, so this might be fine with you. But you should be sure about your answers here before you proceed.

i just wanted to thank you for sharing your experience, TMD. i hope that the hard parts of that experience ease with time.

the eventuality of our (hypothetical) children joining the mormon church is something j(wh) and i have talked about. he believes that, so long as they make the choice as adults, he would be accepting of that. i think his biggest concern is the way a total immersion in mormonism could shape children before they’re old enough to make carefully considered decisions for themselves. which is something i can respect because religion is so important to me. i don’t think one’s religious beliefs should be anything but carefully considered.

i know him well enough that i trust he would accept his adult children’s decisions, even if they were choices he would not make for himself. and i believe i would do the same. for both of us the most important thing is the principles and values that inform our beliefs, rather than the form the beliefs take.

I would be accepting of my adult children’s choices as well, but it’s 18 years to adulthood, sometimes longer. I was tempted to ask a what if question here, but I think the point is that you can’t prepare for every single eventuality. The only thing you can do as a parent is the best you can.

I have a friend with a Catholic mother and a Jewish father. I think the parents decided to raise the kids with both religions and then let them choose. She is now 25 and while not a super devout Catholic, she definitely tends towards the Christian side. This partly has to do with the fact that he father didn’t put in much effort to teaching her and her brother about Judaism. When they moved to Canada when she was a child, her parents assumed they would need to put their kids in private school (evidently this was the case in Peru) and so they enrolled them in Catholic school. Anyway, apparently now the father seems slightly hurt that the kids didn’t “pick his side” but come on, man, you put them in Catholic school.

Anyway, I think it’s good that one of the big things being considered here is how to raise the children. I’m surprised that some people have a hard time understanding how being raised in a typical Mormon fashion could cause pain. Or maybe I shouldn’t be. I suppose this has to do with the fact that lately I have become acutely aware of how indoctrinated I am… I have really been pondering about whether I could feel good about really raising my future children in the church…

Stephanie, I think that at least for me, the idea that the mormon experience is uniquely painful is this issue. Unless someone is in a faith community that lacks any kind of community and interpersonal dynamics, and lacks any kind of coherent or strongly held beliefs, the same things will apply. There are no fewer “pain problems” being raised Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish (well, maybe not some of the reform varieties, which are almost UU anyways, but certainly conservative and orthodox).

And come to think of it, I want to explicate this term ‘interfaith’ here.

Before Christianity and its mythologies reached the Samoan islands, us native islanders had our own ideas and worshippings toward ‘god’/’gods’. The ancient pre-Christian beliefs are a part of me (gods ie, Nafanua, Pili, Salamasina, etc.) most notably in Samoan linguistics (I am fluent in my native tongue).

Reprising the pre-contact religions and ‘faiths’ in my life is my way of ‘faasolo le faaSamoa’, or further flourishing of my Samoan culture (part of the ‘twist’ I mentioned in my previous post).

In this regard, the ‘split’ between two camps of ‘faith’ (affiliated with this particular forum’s use of the term ‘interfaith’) is not so much between me & my nonmember husband Rob.

In this situation, my husband Rob being a nonmember is kind of an afterthought, really (to him, loving & following Jesus is his innate religion – add to that his newfounded disgust for Brigham, Joseph, McConkie and the other Mormon weirdos).

Hmmm…i’ll hafta think more upon this dilemma of mine: colonized, native Pacific Islander who hates and loves her LDS membership.

"afrol News, 28 October - With the signing of two large contracts last week between international oil companies and the Moroccan government to explore promising oil fields off the coast of Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara increases, international protests are being voiced. French and UK organisations yesterday called the agreements ""scandalous"".

The French association of friends of the Sahrawi Republic (AARASD) yesterday ""strongly denounced"" the ""scandalous agreements"" between international oil companies and the Moroccan state regarding the sale of exploration rights off the Western Sahara coast.

Also The Western Sahara Campaign UK yesterday condemned two oil contracts between TotalElfFina and Kerr McGee to exploit the oil resources of the territorial waters of Western Sahara. Under the contracts, TotalFinaElf may explore 115, 000 kilometre square area off the coast of Dakhla Western Sahara for a 12 month period. Kerr McGee signed a deal to explore 110, 000 kilometre square area of deep water off the northern coast of Western Sahara.

President of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Mohamed Abdelaziz, said Wednesday that contracts signed by oil companies Kerr McGee and TotalFinaElf to explore the oil resources offshore Western Sahara were a ""provocation."" The President appealed to the United Nations to annul the contracts with Morocco because they violate international law.

Pro-Sahrawi pressure groups and President Abdelaziz claim this on behalf of the UN refusal to recognise the Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara and the territory's status as a colony. They refer to a 1991 UN resolution, stating that ""the exploitation and plundering of colonial and non-self-governing territories by foreign economic interests, in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations is a grave threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories.""

According to the US Geological Survey of World Energy, year 2000, estimated oil and gas resources off the Saharan coast are substantial and the probability (including both geologic and accessibility probabilities) of finding lucrative oil and gas fields is very high. While it is assessed that Western Sahara has relative large and probable offshore oil resources, numbers for Morocco proper are low and insecure.

Richard Stanforth, spokesperson of the Western Sahara Campaign UK, however comments that in signing the contracts the companies are ""trampling over the basic Human Rights of the Sahrawi people. The contracts are an attempt to legitimise the brutal Moroccan occupation of Western Sahara"" ""Most Sahrawi people from Western Sahara are languishing in refugee camps struggling to survive. They will not see a penny of this money. All this money will go to help Morocco build up its army in Western Sahara.""

AARASD adds that ""as the territory not is autonomous, one cannot accept these resources being alienated at the benefit of the occupying state."" If the international community lets this happen, it would be ""to accept the occupation of Western Sahara"".

The Paris-based oil multi TotalFinaElf last week announced that it ""has signed a reconnaissance contract with the Moroccan state oil company, Office National de Recherches et d'Exploitations Pétrolières (ONAREP), for the Dakhla Offshore zone. Located offshore the town of Dakhla, the zone covers an area of 115,000 km2."" Dakhla was the capital of the Spanish Western Sahara colony before 1975.

According to a TotalFinaElf release, ""the contract covers an initial period of 12 months, during which regional geological and geophysical studies will be undertaken in order to assess the petroleum potential of the zone. These studies will complement the knowledge base that TotalFinaElf has been building-up over several years along the length of the Atlantic coast of Africa.2

The American oil company Kerr-McGee is far more restrictive on its information. The company's website only informs that Kerr-McGee is involved in ""focusing on international deepwater opportunities offshore ... Morocco, ... where it has lease positions"". In November last year, the US company has acquired 33.33 percent interest in the 3 million-acre Cap Draa Haute Mer exploration license offshore Morocco.

Earlier operations abandoned
According to information gathered by UK Western Sahara Campaign, previous attempts to explore Western Sahara oil resources have all been abandoned due to the political risks. Gulf Oil, WB Grace, Texaco and Standard Oil were considering a joint venture with the Spanish authorities in the 1960s.

In the second half of the 1960's the US companies Pan American Hispano Oil, Caltex, Gulf Oil and Phillips undertook an exploration of 2443.192 hectares of Western Saharan desert which led to the discovery of a small layer of 100 km at Faim el Oued. In total 27 strata of oil were discovered in 1964.

In 1978, offshore blocks were awarded to Philips and BP but were quickly abandoned because of the war. In the basin between El Ayoun, Western Saharan capital and Tarfaya (Morocco) bituminous shale was discovered with reserves of 100 million barrels of crude but this can only profitably be extracted if oil prices rise to US$ 40 a barrel. Shell signed a contract to build a treatment works in 1981 but the work was never completed.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Affordable Honda Full-Faired Bike Launch Soon

Honda is likely to launch a full-faired version of the CB Hornet 160R in India by late 2017. The new bike is expected to be priced between Rs 90,000 and Rs 95,000 (ex-showroom)

Honda is gearing up to launch 4 new products in the Indian two-wheeler market this year. The announcement was made by Minoru Kato, new president and CEO for Honda 2Wheelers India. Out of the new product line-up, one will be the Honda Africa Twin adventure tourer motorcycle. Honda officials announced that they have started trial assembly for the Africa Twin, which will be the second performance motorcycle by Honda to be assembled in India. Honda officials refused to divulge any details on the second motorcycle but just mentioned that it will be a “fun” motorcycle and something that would be part of the commuter segment.

In our opinion, the new motorcycle is question can be a fully-faired version of the Honda CB Hornet 160R. Honda currently has one full-faired bike in the 150cc segment as part of its product portfolio - the Honda CBR150R. A faired version of the CB Hornet 160R does make sense as Suzuki has achieved great success with the Gixxer SF, which is the faired version of the Gixxer 155cc motorcycle and currently holds the distinction of being the cheapest full-faired motorcycle on sale in India. The muscular styling of the CB Hornet 160R has played a key role in its success and we expect the new Honda motorcycle to get sharp and sporty styling.

It is likely to follow the Suzuki Gixxer SF’s footsteps of being a relaxed and easy to ride bike and will not have a committed riding posture like the CBR150R. The engine of the new motorcycle will be the same 162.7cc air-cooled motor that churns out 15.9PS of max power with peak torque rating of 14.8Nm. The frame and cycle parts will also be carried forward from the naked motorcycle. We expect the new Honda full-faired bike to be launched by late 2017 and likely to be priced between Rs 90,000and Rs 95,000 (ex-showroom).",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Card clampdown on gamblers

CREDIT card companies are clamping down on customers that use their cards to bet on online gambling sites.

A number of card issuers are changing their terms and conditions so that money placed in an online betting account from a credit card will be treated as cash advance and incur a higher rate of interest.

They will also be charged a 2% handling fee for cash advances, which starts at £2.

The interest charged on cash advances is usually much higher than normal card purchases. For example, Mint charges 14.9% APR on a normal card purchase, but 17.9% for cash advances.

Online gambling has proliferated over the past three years and many gambling sites are challenging the traditional High Street bookies. Punters enjoy the ease and anonymity of betting at home, and online sites also typically offer better odds.

Royal Bank of Scotland is introducing the change from May 1 for its 11m customers. A spokeswoman said: 'The gambling transactions are to be treated as advances as this is felt to be a more accurate means of reflecting that a gambling transaction is effectively a cash equivalent exchange.'

Egg, which has 3m customers, will introduce its own change from April 1. Spokesman Mark Maguire said: 'Essentially, using your card for gambling is quasi cash and we are changing our rules to reflect that. Basically, you are using your card to buy currency.'

A spokesman for PartyGaming, one of the largest online gambling sites on the web, said that very few of its customers are using credit cards to pay for their bets.

He said: 'There are 23 different ways to load your account. Most of our customers use 'e-wallet' services, such as those provided by Neteller or FireOne.'

"Eleven dedicated educators who have been quietly changing the lives of city school kids for the better took center stage on Wednesday at the Daily News Hometown Heroes in Education awards.

Mayor de Blasio joined local luminaries and top education leaders for an emotional ceremony at the Edison Ballroom in Times Square and presented a special posthumous award to the daughter of Kevin O’Connor, the beloved 61-year-old Queens social studies teacher and dean who passed away in April.

“This kind of gathering puts things in a proper perspective and help us focus on what really matters,” de Blasio said. “We're going to take every opportunity to celebrate our educators and I'm so happy we're doing that today.”

The winners of the fourth annual awards included a big-hearted Brooklyn principal who makes sure homeless students and their families have everything they need to succeed in school, a Bronx teacher dedicated to improving communication between parents and teachers and a Queens school nurse who also teaches kids about good nutrition.

Stars from the world of music and television journalism shared the winners' inspirational stories and presented the awards, including hip-hop pioneer DMC and DJ Funkmaster Flex, and local news heavyweights Mary Calvi, David Ushery and Brenda Blackmon.

The educators were presented with Hometown Heroes in Education awards on Wednesday.

“To think about the tens of thousands of lives being shaped, guided and inspired every day in our city's schools is amazing,” said Daily News Editor-in-Chief Jim Rich. “Our educators are the most unsung heroes we have. Today's event is a well-deserved way of honoring them.”

The city’s public school system is the largest in the nation with 1.1 million students, over 76,000 teachers and 1,800 schools.

The News received more than 200 nominations from colleagues, students and others who wanted to recognize the hard work of teachers, principals and other school staffers.

A panel of judges comprised of education experts and parent advocates selected the winners in August.

Kevin O'Connor

Schools Chancellor Carmen Fariña, CUNY Chancellor James Milliken and United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew served as judges and presenters at the ceremony, emphasizing the importance of recognizing top-notch educators.

“What binds us together as educators is that we know we make a difference,” said Fariña, a 50-year veteran of city schools.

“The difference you make, you will sometimes never know,” she added. “It's not the award you get today— it's the fact that because of you, someone's life is transformed.”

Delfina Cheung and DMC.

“How do they show up every September with the enthusiasm they had their first September on the job? That to me is remarkable,” Kiernan said. “They're thinking, 'I've got another fresh class in here and this is a class that once again I'm going to make a difference in their world.' And they're special people because of that.”

The winners of the fourth annual awards included Tammy Katan-Brown, a big-hearted Brooklyn principal who makes sure homeless students and their families have everything they need to succeed in school; Adrian Brooks, a Bronx teacher dedicated to improving communication between parents and teachers; and Sherry Branch, a Queens school nurse who also teaches kids about good nutrition.

O’Connor, a veteran educator, worked at Francis Lewis High School in Fresh Meadows and Campus Magnet High School in Cambria Heights. He was popular for his ability to connect with his students.

His daughter, Kristen Rajak, travelled from Florida for the awards ceremony.

She said she plans to follow in her father’s footsteps and pursue a career in education.

“I can’t even really describe how proud I am of him,” Rajak said after accepting the honor for her father. “I knew that he was special. But this really solidified it that people recognize that and made note of it.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Deadlock 0.4.8 - We need your feedback

Deadlock version 0.4.8 is online and available to all Spearheads and Frontliners. Remember that you can get access to Deadlock and help speed-up the development of Interstellar Marines by upgrading your profile to Spearhead or Frontliner in our store.

Summary

Since the last build we’ve moved into our new (and smaller) office in an effort to save money and keep developing on the game.

After the move we started migrating the project to Unity 4 (from previously running on Unity 3.5), which unfortunately took a lot longer than we had planned for. Basically there were some fundamental changes in the new engine which caused a lot of small problems with our old pipeline and code.

As a result almost all of the time for the last 3 weeks have been spent cleaning up and getting everything to work again in the new engine. So this build turned out to be mostly about maintenance. Fortunately there’s been some nice optimizations in our workflow, and we fixed a couple of vital bugs in the process that had been around for a while.

But most importantly we are now set-up in new offices and on the latest version of Unity, so we can get back to progressing the actual game from here on out!

When we actually get to play the game will we be able to customize our suit. including helmet color, flashlight color. Will we be able to change the suit's vision like night vision, EM Vision, Infrared Vision, Thermal Vision, Optic Vision.

Does our suit include an oxygen Tank to supply air when atmospheres are depressurizing and pressurizing. Add a few air Dispensers and maybe add an Air monitor on the hud just in case you want to know the level of oxygen. Maybe include hazardous areas that require an air filter.

What about a zero-g environment? floating through air and dodging attacks while firing back. I mean people don't always want to walk but maybe float to make it a more real-like environment.

I just bought this last week. I have only ever seen just a single person playing though, and he was new like me. What gives? With this new update I expected some more people to play.
it's mostly crowded. today was the only time I found the servers empty. Better luck next time.

Unity4 is vastly improved for performance. That being said, there is still much that can be done.

Shader 1 (SSAO):
Much improved from before, though it is highly sensitive to dynamic lights (the klaxons for instance). In more static lighting conditions, it is only a 20fps drop or so. With the klaxons, SSAO gives me a drop of about 30-40fps
Can we get settings for SSAO quality and samples?

Shader 2 (Brightness/Color Correct):
No appreciable impact on FPS. Awesome.
However, this does seem to wash the color out a bit too much (for my tastes)

Shader 3 (Bloom/Coronas):
About a 5fps impact for me. Almost negligible.

Shader 4 (HUD Blur):
This seems far too heavy. I'm getting about a 7fps drop. Would it not be simpler to just change to a different HUD overlay with the feathering baked in instead of using an apparently costly shader?

Shader 5 (Vignetting/Vaseline):
Another pricey shader, costs me about 7-8fps in most situations. Surely, vignetting could be accomplished with less impact by using semi-transparent texture overlays instead of a costly shader, yes?

Shader 6 (Edge Smoothing):
About a 18-20fps hit for me. I find it also muddies up the ground textures, etc. I keep it off honestly, takes away the crispness of the things you've created.

Some performance gotchas:
The lightning. Oh, the lightning.

I typically play with shaders 1,3,5 enabled for what I think ""looks best"". For what works best for competitive play, I use everything off except Shader 2.

ATTENTION LINUX USERS i am not sure if this works but this might help with the not being able to play deadlock problem http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/20888/what-ca
n-i-do-for-linux-support.html basically it says install google chrome due to it supporting native client

The facts is that despite the obvious maintenance overhead ... we have talked about combining all images effects into one script ... to make it 3-4x faster overall as we do not have to recalculate each shader pass pr. image effect. (Hope this makes sense) ... That's the challenge of doing pre-pre-alpha development ... it's not always logical to do performance optimizations all the time! :)

Regarding the image effects settings in general ... you know that we're going for ultra high sci-fi realism and not glowing, colorful, lens flared madness ... ""cough"" Battlefield 3 ""cough"" Halo 4 ... but this is a process and we're still a long way from the expression we want ... and at that point not all images effects will be toggleable (for competitive reasons) as gameplay will saturate every artistic choice we make! (Exhausted from sprinting will distort your vision via DOF, color correction, vignette etc.) and so forth!

But, rest assured I/we will listen and evaluate carefully in regard to everybody's shit-filter on look and feel!

No problem Hicks :) I just wanted to point out how each one behaves currently.

If I run native (1280x1024 @ 75fps) on Fastest with everything off, I'm typically getting about 125fps solid. If I turn it up to Fantastic and keep everything off, I'm usually around 79fps or so.

In the previous Deadlock builds on Unity 3.x, I'd be at about 25fps on Fantastic with everything off and about 50fps on Fastest at native.

This represents a HUGE step forward in playability for myself, and I'd imagine most other people.

I realize you're going for a realistic vision for the game, and I completely agree with doing that. However, I think the color correct filter is a bit TOO aggressive. I have a high density of cone cells in my retina, as I imagine most other people do, so I see the world as a fundamentally colorful and vibrant place.

The effect of the color-correct filter is most prominent in the sunset period on the outside level. With it off, the world looks rich and colorful, as it should during the setting of the sun. With it on, everything gets very washed out and the visual impact of the setting sun is lessened considerably.

I just want to caution you against making the mistake that many make in that ""real"" has to look like 50 shades of gray & brown everywhere.

I do like the idea that you'll present a consistent visual experience for competitive reasons, though I do think you (when you get there) should discuss with the community exactly what VFX they agree should be mandatory, and what ones should be optional. For instance, SSAO is not something that will render player shadows into the world, correct? So I would say this should be optional as it provides no tactical advantage, and can be quite heavy for some. Things like that need to be considered. I do think that using desaturation, vignetting, DOF changes, possibly image smearing, and other ""stress"" effects when fatigued/damaged/poisoned would serve to add depth to the gameplay, so I completely agree.

If you combined all the various effects into one script, what would happen? Would we still be able to toggle each effect, or would it simply be a ON/OFF for all 6 shaders?

I know it would be a massive bit of extra work, but would you ever consider making multiple scripts that are combinations of the various settings users could choose? So a script with everything off, a script with everything on, a script with just 1,3,5 on, etc? Again, I realize there are a large number of combinations of the various effects, but in this manner, each option would be fully optimized to run well, correct?

In any case, I look forward to continued testing and experience with IM. I've been... dis-involved for a long time and it was really exciting for me to get back in and to think critically about the game.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The Case of the Missing Polygamists

The origins of our sexuality is the greatest mystery in human evolution. But could our prime suspect be a case of mistaken identity?

If reproductive success were applied to fiction the two billion copies of Agatha Christie's novels (only trailing behind Shakespeare and the Bible) would be considered a stunning example of evolutionary fitness. Her work, in such classics as Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, or Witness for the Prosecution represents a significant portion of our collective memory that is being passed on to future generations. However, researchers have recently uncovered evidence of a tragedy that befell the world's most popular mystery writer and, in so doing, provided a useful lesson when considering genetic evidence for the evolution of human sexuality.

Ian Lancashire and Graeme Hirst at the University of Toronto analyzed the vocabulary used throughout Christie's writing career and determined that the sophistication of her language underwent a significant decline in her final years. By looking at the number of different words used in her novels, as well as the number of repeated phrases, the researchers determined that her vocabulary dropped by almost 31% with the largest decline occurring in her last four books. This, in combination with her family's testimony about undiagnosed physical and mental decline, led the researchers to conclude that they were witnessing the effects of Alzheimer's disease on the world's best-selling author. As a result, Christie's final novels maintained echos of her former work, but they were of a substantially different character to most of her 54-year career as a writer.

Imagine for a moment that everything Agatha Christie had ever written was lost to history except for her last book. If you were to try and form conclusions about her work from this limited account it would result in significant distortions. It would represent the author after she had undergone a profound change and you would be hard pressed to understand why she had ever been so popular. But this kind of selection bias is essentially what we have when we look at the written record of our human past. All of written history, from the earliest accounts in 3,200 BCE to the present, is a mere fragment of human existence on this planet. It is the equivalent of only looking at Agatha Christie's final novel out of 85 published works during a long and distinguished career.

There is no greater mystery in human evolution than the origins of our sexuality. Following the trail of clues available researchers have independently concluded that humans evolved through systems of monogamy, polygamy, as well as polyamory. However, only one can be the culprit. Like a detective interrogating multiple suspects, the solution ultimately depends on which account you're willing to believe.

In 2009 Owen Lovejoy made the case for monogamy based on the fossil remains of the early human ancestor Ardipithecus ramidus. Meanwhile, Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jethá have argued that polyamory (or, more precisely, a multimale-multifemale mating system) is the most likely scenario from an analysis that emphasized anthropology, behavioral biology, and physiology. To further complicate matters the third suspect in this mystery, polygamy, has been the conclusion from scientists conducting DNA analyses. These conflicting accounts therefore require careful detective work in order to determine which story is the most convincing.

Polygyny (the single male-multifemale version of polygamy) is most well known among primates such as baboons or gorillas. These are the species that have been (incorrectly) described as living in ""harems,"" and are often easy to identify since the males can be up to twice the size of females. Many anthropological accounts, most famously George Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas, have suggested that the human species is ""moderately polygynous"" since the majority of studied societies practice polygynous marriage (982 out of 1157 according to Murdock's account).

To test whether these reports of polygyny are a local or species-wide phenomenon evolutionary biologist Michael F. Hammer and colleagues at the University of Arizona published their findings in the journal PLoS Genetics. By analyzing the clues left in our X-chromosomes and comparing their results to human autosomes (any of the additional 22 chromosome pairs that aren't sex-linked) the researchers sought to discover what they call male vs. female ""effective population size,"" or the percentage of males compared to females who were effectively reproducing. If polygyny were indeed the norm it would mean that most men throughout human evolution never reproduced and, in strictly genetic terms, had mysteriously vanished without a trace.

Because women have two X-chromosomes they will always pass one of these to either their son or their daughter. Men, on the other hand, will either pass along an X-chromosome (in the case of a daughter) or a Y-chromosome (if they've had a son). But both men and women pass along the same number of autosomes. This means that by comparing the genetic differences between X-chromosomes and autosomes you can estimate the effective population size of men who successfully reproduced compared to women. In other words, the genetic evidence for effective population size is being used to determine the mating system. Skewed upwards and only a few men in any given population were having children with multiple women as in polygynous systems. However, if the ratio is closer to 1:1 it would be consistent with monogamy since an equal number of men as women were passing on their genes.

Mike Hammer and his team of genetic detectives therefore analyzed the chromosomes from six different societies: French Basque, Han Chinese, Melanesian islanders from Papua New Guinea, Biaka foragers from Central African Republic, Mandenka villagers from Senegal, and San hunter-gatherers from Namibia. The researchers found evidence that there was greater variability on the X-chromosome than would be expected if monogamy had been the standard practice. Instead, the evidence suggested a male-female ratio of relatively few men and multiple women as would be expected in polygyny (ranging from 2.4-to-1 among the San and 8.7-to-1 among the Basque). This genetic evidence by Hammer and colleagues would seem to support Murdock's data on marriage systems and confirm that polygyny was the dominant mating system during human evolution.

But like every good detective mystery, just when you think the case is closed you're treated to a twist ending. Primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy (author of The Woman That Never Evolved, Mother Nature, as well as her latest book Mothers and Others) is one of the leading experts on polygynous mating systems in primates. As she explained to me in our recent correspondence there are several important considerations that have been left out of this story. The most important is the kind of sample bias I referred to earlier if we were to make conclusions about Agatha Christie's work based only on her final novel. The DNA evidence may be a record of the human past, but how far into the past does it actually go? As Hrdy explained:

Keep in mind that in terms of interpreting such genetic evidence we are of necessity confined to a fairly recent time depth (and remember, by ""recent"" someone like me means the last 10,000 years or so). For this time period multiple lines of evidence do indeed suggest that humans were moderately to extremely polygynous and that women were moving between groups more than men were.

There is also something very important to consider that dramatically influenced human behavior within the last 10,000 years: the invention of agriculture. Prior to about 12,000 years ago all humans were hunter-gatherers and lived a migratory existence. With the advent of farming some human societies began to remain sedentary for the first time in our history. This change had serious impacts on human life and behavior. Just as Alzheimer's dramatically altered the content of Agatha Christie's work, so agriculture radically transformed human society and, by consequence, sexual behavior.

Hrdy argues that there was a major disruption in human residence patterns as a result of this ""agricultural revolution."" In small bands of modern day hunter-gatherers there is a mixture of what anthropologists call matrilocal and patrilocal residence, the practice of women or men to stay within the community they're born into while the other migrates between communities. However, recent research has shown that hunter-gatherer societies today emphasize matrilocal (or bilocal) residence while fewer than 25% are considered patrilocal. This is in stark contrast to the larger scale agricultural societies where an estimated 70% are patrilocal.

According to Hrdy, pre-agricultural human societies would likely have been similar to modern day hunter-gatherers, but the rise of agriculture changed this pattern dramatically. Over the past 10,000 years or so, Hrdy explained, ""matrilocal societies gave way to pressures from more expansionist patrilocal societies."" This simple change had serious repercussions for both human life and the genetic record. Patrilocal societies typically show increased hierarchies, greater male control over women's sexual choices, and more competition among men compared to matrilocal societies. Patrilocal societies are also usually polygynous. Therefore, the larger numbers of patrilocal (and polygynous) societies today is likely the consequence of agriculture and not a true reflection of the human past. Like Agatha Christie's writing, many human societies underwent a dramatic transformation and basing our conclusions on this period would distort our understanding of what came before.

But there is an even more basic problem in assuming a polygynous human mating system. Modern day bonobos and chimpanzees have a male vs. female effective population size of between 2-to-1 and 4-to-1. If we were using the same argument presented by Hammer and colleagues, these two species should be considered ""moderately polygynous"" as well. Two independent genetic studies found both bonobos and chimpanzees to be similar to humans on identical criteria. As one study (Erickson et al., 2006) concluded, ""the male effective population size in bonobos is small and similar to that suggested from comparable data in humans,"" while, in the second study (Langergraber et al., 2007), the ""data indicate that the sex difference in effective population size is similar in chimpanzees and humans."" It turns out that our would-be perpetrator has two reliable alibis.

Despite Pan's moderately polygynous genetics, the bonobo and chimpanzee mating system is most accurately described as multimale-multifemale because males and females each mate with multiple individuals. Of course, this isn't random or indiscriminate mating since females are making careful decisions about who they choose to mate with, and when. The effective population size in bonobos and chimps shows up looking genetically similar to humans because females choose to preferentially mate with high-ranking males during their peak of ovulation. Females still choose to mate with additional males at other times of their cycle, but since these don't produce offspring the end result is that relatively few males are passing on their genes. As Hrdy has demonstrated, something very similar has been shown among humans. This makes a multimale-multifemale mating system the prime suspect in our evolutionary whodunit.

In humans, bonobos, and many other primates, there is a great deal more non-conceptive sexual behavior going on than most people -- from Saint Augustine to contemporary biologists - realize. For example, in South American partible paternity societies, the woman's official mate or husband is still statistically more likely to be the progenitor of offspring she produces, even though other men can and do have some probability of paternity, or at the very least, perceive that they do.

Because of this, Hrdy notes, in a large number of human societies women may be having multiple sexual partners at any given time, but there will usually be a relatively small number of men who are the actual fathers of their children. In this way the missing persons in our evolutionary mystery would be the result of sample bias. It's not because our genes don't reveal the full story, it's because women have only chosen some men whose genetic tale they wanted future generations to remember. In the evolution of human sexuality, as it was in Agatha Christie's life and work, such stories can be subject to dramatic alterations depending on the circumstances and care must be taken lest we misinterpret and obscure the very mystery we're trying to solve.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)

Eric Michael Johnson

I grew up in an old house in Forest Ranch, California as the eldest of four boys. I would take all day hikes with my cat in the canyon just below our property, and the neighbor kids taught me to shoot a bow and arrow. I always loved reading and wrote short stories, poems, and screenplays that I would force my brothers to star in. A chance encounter with a filmmaker from Cameroon sent me to Paris as his assistant and I stayed on to hitchhike across Europe. Nearly a year later, I found myself outside a Greek Orthodox Church with thirty Albanian and Macedonian migrants as we looked for work picking potatoes.

After my next year of college I moved to Los Angeles to study screenwriting and film production. My love of international cinema deepened into larger questions about the origins of human societies and cultures. I entered graduate school with a background in anthropology and biology, joining the world-renowned department of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University to pursue a PhD in great ape behavioral ecology. But larger questions concerning the history and sociology of scientific ideas cut my empirical research short. I am now completing a dissertation at University of British Columbia on the intersection between evolutionary biology and politics in England, Europe, and Russia in the nineteenth century. In 2011 I met the economist and Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen whose work inspired my award-winning research.

My writing has always been a labor of love and a journey unto itself. I have written about the hilarity that ensues once electrodes are stuck into your medial ventral prefrontal cortex for Discover, the joy of penis-fencing with the endangered bonobo for Wildlife Conservation, and the ""killer-ape"" myth of human origins from Shakespeare's The Tempest to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey for Times Higher Education. My work has appeared online for Wired, PLoS Blogs, Psychology Today, Huffington Post, SEED, ScienceBlogs, Nature Network and a host of independent science related websites. I have appeared four times in The Open Laboratory collection of the year's best online science writing and was selected the same number as a finalist for the Quark Science Prize, though better writers have always prevailed. I am currently working on my first book.

If I am not engaged in a writing or research project I spend time with my young son, Sagan. Whenever I get the chance I go on backpacking trips in the mountains of British Columbia or catch the latest film from Zhang Yimou, the Coen Brothers, or Deepa Mehta. To this day one of my favorite passages ever written is from Henry David Thoreau's Walden where he describes an epic battle between ants in Concord, an injured soldier limping forward as the still living heads of his enemies cling to his legs and thorax ""like ghastly trophies at his saddle-bow."" Thoreau helped fugitive slaves to escape while he mused on the wonder and strange beauty of the natural world. Not a bad way to spend an afternoon.

"I need some help ladies! Bout my ex texting me how am I and what not?

so she texts me after a couple months of not talking asking how I've been so for me it was like oh shit cause i still have mad feelings for this girl right? but it just feels weird texting her now and even how we were texting just seemed like a friendly manner which kind of throws me off yet she was trying to keep a convo.. after bout a day or two of texting i said well i know you wanted to see how i was but im going to knock out and i dont know if you feel obligated to keep texting me but if not ill text you tomorrow or whenever and she replied that she nver felt obligated but was saying she was going to bed too cause she is exhausted and i never texted her back goodnight or the next day.. im lost what do you guys think this means? should i text her or see if she ever texts me again even tho i said i would? by the way she dumped me and is in college

What Girls Said 2

there's no need for you to feel obligated by replying her text messages. from my point of view. Once an EX is only an EX. no need to be friends with them. friends? for what? that'll be useless. You can still text them back or talk to them but only a respect not feel obliged with it. just ignore her or if she keeps on troubling you, you can change a contact number. :)

thank you! helps a lot but i told her i dont know if she feels obligated to text me and she said she isn't so she's wanting to but a question i have is should i wait and see if she ever texts me again or should i text her back? by the way you're amazing thank you for the help

for me.. when she said that she's not obligated, maybe i agree with but on the other side, it's the guilt that's holding her back. And NO, for me.. there's no point in waiting and no point texting her back. Just go forward.. it' s not easy at first but you'll get over it soon. You'll find someone whose much better than her. ^_^",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Source Control with Unity and Visual Studio

The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.

DISCLAIMER: Because I am going to be recommending a Microsoft product, it behooves me - for several reasons - to inform you that I currently work for Microsoft. That said, all of the opinions on this blog, my Twitter, etc., are my own.

The Story So Far

It's unquestionable that Unity has become the go-to engine for indie developers. The ease with which you can add objects to your levels, script behaviors, and build to several different platforms makes it an obvious choice for everything from rapid prototyping to releasing a full AAA title.

When Psydra Games was ready to dive into our second game, after a short break following the release of Dark Scavenger, I was still a beginner with Unity, but its potential was already obvious. If nothing else, we could quickly get a prototype up and running of Lead Designer Alex Gold's crazy idea. The more we dove in, the clearer it was that this was definitely the engine for us.

And although Unity is for the most part a one-stop solution for game development, we were lacking in two areas:

Code Editor: While adequate for prototyping, as a long-term solution, MonoDevelop just isn't up to the standard of Unity's user-friendliness.

Version Control: This certainly isn't a failing on Unity's part, particularly for a free game development tool. Still, it's a necessity for having backups of your work, as well as collaborating with teammates.

As it turns out, both of these issues were solved with the same tool: Visual Studio.

Visual Studio has had its free Express version for a long time, but in November, Microsoft released the so-called ""Community Edition"", which has almost none of the restrictions that exist in Express. This was a great day particularly for Unity users, as the new Community Edition of Visual Studio even allows for plugins, such as UnityVS, which can be very useful for debugging your games.

Many developers are still unaware of the benefits to using Visual Studio, especially its source control, so I wanted to provide a little how-to (as well as a why-to) guide for Unity and Visual Studio, working in (near) perfect harmony.

Connecting Unity and Visual Studio

With that installed, you just need to set it as your code editor in Unity via Edit->Preferences->External Tools.

To be honest, I've had mixed results with this setting, and so by habit, I just open VS separately and open the solution directly. I've not found a great reason to constantly close and reopen VS, so opening it the same time as Unity and getting yourself set up should be a quick one-time process per development session.

That's really all there is to connecting VS with Unity. Again, UnityVS will further enhance this connection, allowing you to use the Visual Studio debugger, set breakpoints in your scripts, and many other handy features. The only important thing to note is that Unity will make edits to the solution file upon loading the project and upon adding or removing source files, which will prompt you to reload it in VS. This means that if you load up VS and your project's solution file before you load Unity, get ready to reload that solution right away, even if no changes have been made since you last loaded Unity.

Visual Studio Source Control

That brings us to the fun stuff: source control. If you are working alone, maybe you just need to backup your project and have versions to reference. If you're working on a team, source control can make all the difference in how quickly and smoothly your updates integrate with those of your colleagues. There are different settings that may apply to either scenario, so I'll include both options.

The first step in source control is the Unity set-up. By default, Unity has ""hidden meta files"". These meta files contain settings for the assets in your project, such as import settings and the GUIDs for those assets. This information is obviously vital to your project, and so your source control needs to be able to see them. Go to Edit->Project Settings->Editor, and under Version Control, Select ""Visible Meta Files"".

Also, while you're in these settings, if you set ""Asset Serialization"" to ""Force Text"", you can have multiple people working in the same scene, and merge the changes through your source control, as version control systems are often made to merge text files.

Next, you need to get set up with hosting for your source control. To use Visual Studio's Team Foundation Server, you can sign up for a free Microsoft account, providing you with version control hosting with no space or version limitations. The only limitation to the free service is a maximum of 5 users for your projects. If you are working with a larger team, you could either pay to upgrade, or work with another service (a Git source control plugin is also included with Visual Studio). Because our team fit perfectly in the 5-user limit, we went with Team Foundation Server hosting. As a bonus, TFS provides an agile task board, something else we had shopped around for a lot before settling on Visual Studio.

You'll want to create a new project through the website to contain your game. Then log into your account in Visual Studio, and under the ""Team"" menu, select, ""Connect to Team Foundation Server..."". The URL for your TFS hosting will show up in the server dropdown, which will contain your new project.

Here's where some options may change depending on your preferences and team setup.

Working with Workspaces

There are two options for workspaces in Visual Studio. One is Local (which for some reason is recommended), and the other is Server. A local workspace allows you to edit your files locally, and only connects with the server when you sync and submit files. A server workspace requires connection to the server when you check files out, and all server files are marked as read-only until they are checked out. Personally, the only way I can recommend using a local workspace is if you are working alone, and are only using the server to back up your project. I'm sure there are other scenarios, such as working from a laptop while traveling with no access to WiFi, but in general, I would stick with server workspaces for team projects.

And there are a few big reasons for that. First, because local workspaces don't connect to a server to check files out, your teammates cannot see what you are working on, which could mean duplicate work, incompatible edits, etc. Second, it means that you can't enforce exclusive checkouts, so that you don't have to worry about merging changes. And third, something I'm in favor of for everyone's awareness, it forces you to know what files you're editing, which also prevents you from editing files you didn't mean to, and submitting them to the source control.

For these reasons, I made the default workspace for our project a server workspace. To set this, go to Team->Team Project Collection Settings->Source Control

However, if you want, you can change your own workspace to be local. I changed the default because it makes it easier for everyone to get set up with the type of workspace I wanted them to use - and to be perfectly honest, if you want to ""enforce"" a workspace type, the less ambitiously curious members of your team will probably never dig deep enough to realize they can change it. So don't let them read this blog, because here's how you do that.

On the right side of Visual Studio, under the Team Explorer tab, click on your workspace name (probably your computer's name), and select ""Manage Workspaces"".

Click the ""Edit..."" button on the next screen, and then ""Advanced >>>"". The ""Location:"" dropdown determines whether your workspace is local or server.

With your workspace all set up, you can start synching and submitting files. First, map the server to a location on a local drive. Then right-click and click ""Get Latest"", which will download the temporary files that Visual Studio Online provided to get you started.

Now you're ready to get your project online and accessed by other team members. Put your existing project into the folder you mapped in source control, and grab the ""Assets"" and ""Project Settings"" folders. You don't need the ""Library"" folder, nor the solution files in your source control, as they are generated/edited by Unity when you load and make changes to the project.

If you go to the Team Explorer tab on the right and select ""Pending Changes"", you can see all of the files ready to be submitted to the server. You can submit these files by clicking the ""Check In"" button, and optionally (and certainly recommended) adding a comment about what you did.

Being Tricky

Now, if you're only adding a file/folder or two, this is pretty painless. However, once your project is on the server, you'll most likely start to add several different files in several different places. Adding these one by one can get tedious, so there is a shortcut.

First, do all of your work locally; add the files you need in your local version of the project, and make whatever changes you need (sometimes manually checking out server files is required, but Unity will force overwrite asset files you edit). When all of you work is done, go to your Source Control Explorer, and right-click the ""Assets"" folder (do not use the root project folder, as you don't need the library folder and its metadata), and click ""Compare"".

A list of your changes (and possibly file updates you didn't sync yet) will show up in a new tab. From here, you can select all, right-click, and select ""Reconcile"". This will provide you with some options such for resolving these differences. By default, it will add any files that aren't already on the sever and download updates you don't have from the server. It will not by default, however, open for edit the files you have changed but didn't already check out. This may be a good thing, as it will show you files you may have edited by mistake, and give you the opportunity to undo those changes rather then submitting them, or you may want to change that setting to check out all files that you have edited.

Another quick thing to note about Visual Studio source control is that any files you have checked out and submit with no changes will be automatically reverted. This means that you can check out an entire folder, edit one file, and when you check everything in, only that one file will be submitted, and the rest will simply have the server checkout undone. This minimizes the number of files everyone has to sync to without you having to explicitly undo files you didn't end up editing.

"The Rub on Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)

The Rub on Conjunctivitis (Pink Eye)

Conjunctivitis, or “pink eye” as it’s more commonly called, affects more than 3million Americans each year. While most commonly found in children ages 3-13, conjunctivitis can be contracted at any age. Itching, noticeable redness, and tearing in the affected eye are all symptoms, but conjunctivitis can be caused by several different factors.

In simple terms, pink eye is an irritation (or inflammation) of the conjunctiva – the thin, clear outer membrane that covers the whites of the eyes and the insides of the eyelids. Foreign bodies come into contact with the surface of the eye and this triggers inflammation in the conjunctiva, which causes the conjunctival blood vessels to dilate. This dilation of blood vessels is what causes the pink-red, bloodshot appearance of the eyes.

In each case of pink eye, it’s important to immediately remove contact lenses and wear only your glasses to lessen the risk of any possible complications. And though it sounds scary, conjunctivitis is typically easy to treat; and, with proper awareness and precautions, it can even be avoided. There are three primary types of conjunctivitis, and though there are some similarities, each type is very different from the other.

1. Allergic Conjunctivitis

This type of pink eye is caused by any number of different allergens making contact with the surface of the eyes. Depending upon the specific allergies, susceptible individuals could be at higher risk for allergic conjunctivitis either seasonally or year-round. For instance, those suffering from pollen allergies would be at a higher risk for pink eye during the season in which those plants are pollenating. While those suffering from dust, dander, or environmental allergies would be more susceptible to allergic pink eye year-round.

Allergic conjunctivitis is marked by itchy, burning, and watering in both eyes, never just one. Most allergies are multi-systemic, meaning the histamine releases associated with allergic reactions affect two or more of the body’s systems. For this reason, allergic conjunctivitis is often accompanied by a runny nose or sinus congestion. However, because allergies can’t be passed on from person to person, this type of pink eye isn’t contagious.

2. Bacterial Conjunctivitis

Though less common than the other two types, bacterial conjunctivitis can lead to infection and serious eye damage when left untreated. Bacteria are usually introduced to the eye from physical contact as opposed to contact from airborne bodies. For instance, bacteria could be present on a door handle or flat surface. After touching these surfaces and then touching or rubbing eyes, bacteria could be introduced to the conjunctiva and cause inflammation. Maintaining good hygiene and regular handwashing can help to limit infection and the colonization of harmful bacteria.

In addition to the typical redness associated with pink eye, bacterial conjunctivitis is marked by a thick, yellow or green discharge in the corner of the eye. In some cases, the discharge can be productive enough to cause the eyelids to become stuck together after sleeping or napping. Pink eye caused by bacteria can affect one or both eyes and is contagious, with bacteria usually being transmitted after direct contact with the infected eye, infected hands, or after handling instruments or objects that have touched the infected eye. Bacterial conjunctivitis can be a serious medical issue. Contact your optometrist immediately if you show any signs or symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis.

3. Viral Conjunctivitis

The most common form of conjunctivitis is also, unfortunately, the most contagious. For this reason, an outbreak of viral conjunctivitis, say, in your child’s 5th grade class will spread like wildfire. Viruses are expert travelers, and in most cases, are transmitted through the air via sneezing or coughing from an infected individual. As with any viral infection, those with viral conjunctivitis should limit their exposure to non-infected people while experiencing symptoms.

Although it can affect both eyes, symptoms of viral conjunctivitis typically present themselves in just one eye. As with any virus, this type of pink eye will typically run its course and symptoms will subside with no medical treatment required. In addition to rest, applying a cold, damp washcloth to the eyes several times daily can help relived the itchiness and irritation associated with viral conjunctivitis. However, be sure not to share your washcloth, so as not to infect anyone else with viral pink eye.

Though each of the primary types of conjunctivitis are distinct from each other, it can often be difficult to determine which type of pink eye you may have by symptoms alone. Any time you develop red, irritated eyes, you should call an optometrist immediately to schedule an eye exam.

"The arm bones of women who lived 7,000 years ago show an incredible level of strength – even higher than today’s elite athletes. That’s according to a first-ever study comparing prehistoric bones to those of living people.

The finding suggests a revision of history – the everyday lives of prehistoric women were filled with hard manual labour, rather than just sitting at home doing lighter domestic tasks while the men slogged.

Prior to the advent of writing, there are no clear records describing how our ancient ancestors lived. We have some artefacts, and rock art, and bones – and, as it turns out, those bones can tell us a lot.

“It can be easy to forget that bone is a living tissue, one that responds to the rigours we put our bodies through,” said lead author Alison Macintosh of the University of Cambridge’s Department of Archaeology and Anthropology.

“Physical impact and muscle activity both put strain on bone, called loading. The bone reacts by changing in shape, curvature, thickness and density over time to accommodate repeated strain.”

Previous studies only compared female bones to contemporary male bones, the researchers said – and that’s a problem, because the response of male bones to stress and change is much more visibly dramatic than that of women.

For instance, as humans moved from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle constantly on the move to a more settled agrarian one, changes can be observed in the structure of the shinbone (or tibia) – and these changes were much more pronounced in men.

However, a comparison of the bones of prehistoric women to the bones of living female athletes can help us work out a more accurate picture of what those prehistoric women were doing.

“By analysing the bone characteristics of living people whose regular physical exertion is known, and comparing them to the characteristics of ancient bones, we can start to interpret the kinds of labour our ancestors were performing in prehistory,” Macintosh said.

Macintosh’s team recruited Cambridge athletes such as rowers and runners, as well as more sedentary volunteers, and used a small CT scanner to analyse their arm and leg bones.

They also used 3D laser imaging and silicone moulding to create models of 89 tibiae and 78 humeri of women from the Neolithic, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age and the Medieval.

What they found was that women’s leg strength hasn’t changed a great deal over the millennia – but powerful arms used to be the norm. Neolithic women, the researchers found, had arm strength 11-16 percent stronger than those of modern rowers, and 30 percent stronger than those of non-athletes.

Bronze Age women’s arms were 9-13 percent stronger than those of rowers.

It’s difficult to say what activities would have contributed to this increased strength, but we can make some educated hypotheses – such as grinding grain into flour by hand using stones, an activity that could have taken up to five hours a day.

“The repetitive arm action of grinding these stones together for hours may have loaded women’s arm bones in a similar way to the laborious back-and-forth motion of rowing,” Macintosh said.

And there were other tasks women would have been performing, too.

“Prior to the invention of the plough, subsistence farming involved manually planting, tilling and harvesting all crops. Women were also likely to have been fetching food and water for domestic livestock, processing milk and meat, and converting hides and wool into textiles.”

So next time you see some sexist twerp wonking on about how prehistoric men did the work while women sat on their hands, feel free to scoff long and loud.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

* Fracking in U.S. Lifts Guar Farmers in India

NY Times: “Sohan Singh’s shoeless children have spent most of their lives hungry, dirty and hot. A farmer in a desert land, Mr. Singh could not afford anything better than a mud hut and a barely adequate diet for his family.

Farmers waited this month to receive free guar seeds from an Indian company.

But it just so happens that when the hard little bean that Mr. Singh grows is ground up, it becomes an essential ingredient for mining oil and natural gas in a process called hydraulic fracturing.

Halfway around the world, earnings are down for an oil services giant, Halliburton, because prices have risen for guar, the bean that Mr. Singh and his fellow farmers raise.

Halliburton’s loss was, in a rather significant way, Mr. Singh’s gain — a rare victory for the littlest of the little guys in global trade. The increase in guar prices is helping to transform this part of the state of Rajasthan in northwestern India, one of the world’s poorest places. Tractor sales are soaring, land prices are increasing and weddings have grown even more colorful.

“Now we have enough food, and we have a house made of stone,” Mr. Singh said proudly while his rail-thin children stared in awe.

Guar, a modest bean so hard that it can crack teeth, has become an unlikely global player, and dirt-poor farmers like Mr. Singh have suddenly become a crucial link in the energy production of the United States.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Do you
know the story of Jacob’s ladder? We have
Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, trying to flee from his twin Esau who had vowed
to kill him. Esau was angry with Jacob
for taking away his inheritance. On his
way to his relative’s house, Jacob laid down to rest, and dreamt of a ladder
descending with God’s angels upon it.
Jacob saw God standing above it, repeating his promise of support that
he had made to Jacob’s father and grandfather, saying “Behold, I am with you
and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you….” (Genesis
28:15)

In the
book of Genesis, Jacob’s ladder is the long link between earth and heaven, God’s
promise of redemption and support. This
image has revisited my mind so many times in the last few weeks. When I have read of bans and detentions. Of outcry and protest. Of fear.

Let me
tell you another story, of a woman who is tired and traveling with a fractious 2-year-old
which has only made her more so. She is missing
her mother, too ill to travel and visit her in America, but now she is looking
forward to seeing her husband and making sure he is eating. Her neighbors will look in on him, she is
sure but still. This trip had been
planned for months. Money scraped
together to make the visit. And it was a
wonderful one. But there is a
problem. Her greencard will no longer
permit her entry into the United States.
The TSA agent has detained her.
And her child sensing her fear, begins to cry. She tries to call her husband, who is frantic
with worry. He tells her he is trying to
find someone to straighten everything out.
He asks if she is well, if their daughter is all right? As the hours pass and the tension mounts, and
she is regarded with piteous suspicion she looks forward to the double doors
that clear customs and wonders if she will see her husband on the other side.

Then
there is another mother, who hasn’t seen or smelled or considered home in over a
year. Ever since she had to flee with
her child and her brother-in-law, when she had to barter and steal to make sure
her family could eat, when she worried about the anger forming in her nephew’s
eyes as he struggled to understand that asylum can also mean “trapped.” She has not bathed often and even when she
has, it has been in cold water. Her
digestive system is in ruins because she eats rarely, preferring instead to
give her portion away to the children. She
has been forced to undress in front of strangers and sleep on floors. Her university education and love of poetry
no longer matter. Another woman in the
temporary camp she lived in for 6 months told her that her husband’s cousin, a
law professor, was now a check-out clerk.
Despite the humiliation she has endured she says she will do the
same. Anything was better than worrying
if she was going to be alive by the day’s end.
She prays constantly. And
finally, the interviews are over and she is here, in the United States. But she is barred entry. Her accented flawless English, cultivated
from years of pouring over the Romantics, is mocked. She closes her eyes, and takes a seat. And waits.
In a clean airport, at least, she does not have to fear being
raped. But she has not stopped asking
God for deliverance. Her eyes seek
heaven.

When
everything on earth is gone. When
someone is vowing to kill you for stealing a birthright, you look towards
heaven with profound faith. Your clothes,
food and any other cultural marker has vanished. Your faith is all you have left. And that carries you all the way to a new
shore.

Jacob’s
ladder.

I will not be the one to break the rung of another's faith;

I will help her hold on to it.

I have hurt while watching voracious and blatant attacks on social media
with unverified links from both sides.
And since it seems that so many get their news from social media where
anyone can post anything with an email address and a pseudonym, truth and
justice is being pulled further away and fear is the sole resounding rallying
cry. A dangerous wail of frustration.

When fear
moves us, the ladder stretches even higher.
The rungs increase in spacing and number. We forget entirely about bringing the kingdom
of heaven here, and we forget what that means.
We forget kindness. We forget
love. We breed our own terror.

My son
wrote in his notes about the Boston Massacre, “In 1770, a snowball was thrown
at a British solider and he then fired his musket killing 5 colonists.” Can you imagine an environment of such
tension and fear that a simple snowball would result in the spark that began a
war? Because when I see the fear in the
eyes of protestors, the fear is mirrored in those detainees. And such fear will culminate in an extraordinary
way, if we do nothing.

Let me
explain by relaying a part of a particularly frustrating conversation I had
with someone recently:

“I’ve
seen the order—there is NO BAN.”

Me: “It
doesn’t matter.”

“What do
you mean it doesn’t matter?! These
people are protesting for nothing. There
isn’t a ban, it is the same document that has been instituted by
administrations over the last 16 years!”

Me: “I don’t
care.”

“You have
to care. This is crazy. People are just willing to protest anything.”

Me: “They’re afraid—

”

“Afraid?
Of what!”

“It no
longer matters what the language says.
All that matters is the fear that it inspires. That should we start turning away those in
need of help—

”

“It’s
temporary.”

“Tell
that to the detainee. Tell her it’s only
temporary after she traveled a lifetime to get there. Tell him that his business, his family, the
life he created after leaving another behind is no longer his to claim. Tell him he must wait even though he’s paid
taxes, met with his daughter’s teachers, volunteered in his community, gone to
public meetings. Tell him.”

“Come on.”

“No. No come on.
I saw on Facebook, a woman I know posted, ‘I guess we’re all immigration
experts now,’ complete with an eyeroll.
But she doesn’t understand, that this is just now too much. That the democracyde Tocquevillecritiqued
is becoming realized while the ideals the Founders stood for seems to be
radically misunderstood.”

“No, wait
a minute.”

“No. These people?
They are afraid. And maybe for
too long we’ve all just passively accepted that those elected officials embody
the ideals they are sworn to uphold. We
haven’t kept an eye on them. Now their grandstanding seems divided on party lines, exacerbated by the tension in the air.”

“That’s
not the law. That is not what it
says. We have a responsibility to the
citizens of this country. And we have a
court system and Congress that were created to check and balance one
another. You know that.”

“It doesn’t
matter. It’s the state of the union. And unless this President addresses this
fear. A very real fear to the people he
represents, something will happen that will be bigger than a snowball fight.”

“A
snowball fight?”

“Never
mind. It’s just that they’re afraid. And while fear can be irrational, it needs to
be taken seriously. I would never send
my child back to bed to face the monsters he believes are there. I will go.
I will turn on the lights. I will
recheck the closet and under the bed. I
will stay and hold his hand until he feels safe. I will do it so he feels he doesn’t see
monsters everywhere when he is older and when it is the bright light of day. For some people the monsters never go away and the shadow they cast becomes real, because no one took the time to explain that they are NOT real.

My cousin
is Muslim. Another came into this
country seeking asylum. I am a first-generation
immigrant. I took the oath of
citizenship just shy of my 18th birthday, the original oath
promising to defend America and bear arms against any enemies foreign or
domestic. I am proud to have grown up
here, for the intense sacrifices and scrutiny my parents have borne to raise me
here. My father said that there is
nowhere else on earth where dreams can be realized. Where if someone worked hard enough success
would come despite family name or the circumstances of birth. This, for me, is deeply personal.

There has
not been a single year in my memory when I haven’t been witness to a parent (or
I myself) being told to “get out
of the country and never come back.”
Through the years of both party administrations, the racism and sexism
has kept coming:

My mother
was given threatening letters at work during theIran hostage crisisand told
to “watch [her] back, that [someone] would be coming for [her].” When my mother showed her supervisor, she
looked the other way and shrugged.

I was jovially, loudly (and repeatedly) warned by Mr. Adams, my high school Biology teacher, not to be found riding the elephant in the rotunda at the Natural History Museum before getting off the bus for our field trip.

I was
asked for my contact information because the little boy in my grocery cart
looked so well cared for, was I available then to nanny for [her] family? “He’s my son,” I said quietly and placed the
packages woodenly on the belt. “He’s my
son and I teach in the English Department at ----- College.”

My father
had full cans of soda thrown at him during his lunch walks in Georgetown and
screamed at and called everything but a child of God.

At the park when Joe was a toddler, I went to grab something from the stroller, and saw Joe reaching over to say hi to another little boy. They spun wheels on the playground together. When I walked over to see him, his mother, a lovely blonde just like her little boy, abruptly picked him and said in a carrying whisper, “We don't play with those people.”

My father
was punched and his cheekbone crushed by a drunken African American orderly
when my father told him he couldn’t touch one of his patients in that condition.

We have had bricks thrown through our window.

Years
ago, I was told I was taking away good American jobs, I remember looking up from the vegetable bins at the market and said, “I wasn’t aware you were
looking for an Assistant Professorship in Literature?”

So none
of this language, as bad as it has gotten, is surprising for me. In fact, as a minority woman, in an
interracial marriage, I can tell you I’ve experienced much worse.

If any
good can come out of this intense unrest and pain—such excruciating pain—we are
witnessing, it is this: that people are understanding the process of
Democracy. They are looking to
understand how government works. They
are learning the names of their representatives and calling them. Accountability is becoming important,
passivity can no longer be the order of the day, no matter who is in
charge.

--Jamal Joseph

“There is
no expiration date on dreams and there is no
start date on activism.” But there has
to be a purpose and a common one, of a better and kinder and more decent world.
To be even more personal, I’ll share with you an insight a therapist once told my
husband and myself, “You know I think you both needed this. Your marriage needed this. You needed to hit a bottom in order to
rebuild and begin again to talk to one another.
To learn to talk to one another.”
A hard reset. Maybe this is a
truth for us all now as well. We need a
call-back to the gravity and courage of the founding of this country that
sought liberty from any kind of oppression.

I hold those truths very dearly indeed and have explained to
my children that despite our personal disagreements we have to look at the
manner in which the country works, and allow that process to continue. And yet, this order? The rationale is not sound and the agents
involved to carry it out, do not seem to be equipped to undertake it.

With one
brief exception, I have not found any TSA agent to be especially kind or
helpful. I have found them to be
uniformly brusque, rude and having serious misconception of their
authority. One team in Tampa took aside
my then 4-year-old son, and removed him from my presence as he looked at me in
panic. They tested his small palms for
gunpowder residue: twice. And yelled at
him when he, so scared and shocked, as I could see through the partition, was
too nervous to place his hands palm up.
He had tears in his eyes as he was delivered back to me. Through clenched teeth, I said, “you are not
allowed to take a minor away from his parents to search him.” The man grinned, winked and said, “have a
nice day Paki.”

So these
are the people who have to enforce these restrictions. These men and women are in full charge of
people who have been traumatized once, twice, many many times over?

“We have
to let this play out in the court system.”

“No we
cannot. We cannot. How much longer does a permanent resident have
to wait before moving beyond those double doors? The court system? And if one such detainee can by some miracle
find a lawyer just beyond the door to file an injunction, what form needs to be
used? No. There is no more time.”

“There is
neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female,
for you are alone in Christ Jesus” (Galatians 3:28). Step-by-step, rung by rung we have to climb
this ladder. We cannot do it alone. And we must help each other reach further. Fear
cannot divide us. We have to confront
it; we have to ask the hard questions of why we are scared. We have to recall Japanese-American internment, Chinese labor camps, and the lingering shock and acrid residue of
war; we must face our fear.

Your
humanity and decency calls upon you to act in kind to another. To believe in both of those ideals despite
any evidence to the contrary and to see them in another. We must try.

Remember
that woman, that mother trying to calm the racing of her heart and seeking with
eyes to find recognition of her humanity in another's? That woman could have easily been my mother
in 1973. That child—me. That
man seeking asylum and rest? Jesus. There can be no greater evidence of God than
our love for one another in the face of our differences.

I have to
thank you for reading this, when you are most likely tired and weary of reading
so much on the same. When you have seen
and witnessed and borne pain yourself, watching friendships end and
relationships crumble. The first person
I know I must reach is the person whose views are in absolute contradiction to
my own. So I foresee many formidable
arguments in my future. But it’s worth
it. Change cannot come without
discomfort, and challenge will sharpen our own ideas. Combined is a path toward cooperation and a
willing hand to continue the climb. In its undertaking, I wish you peace, strength, and above all else, courage.

What the story said...my reviews on goodreads

“You must understand, this is one of those moments.” “What moments?” “One of the moments you keep to yourself,” he said. “What do you mean?” I said. “why?” “We’re in a war,” he said. “The story of this war—dates, names, who started it, why—that belongs to everyone. [….] But something like this—this is yours. It belongs only to you. And me. Only to us” (56). This moment, in Téa Obreht’s lyrical first novel, The Tiger’s Wife, tells you the entirety of the story of love and loss, of memory, maps and war, of science, fables and imagined histories. The tale, set in a fictional Balkan province, is about the relationship between the narrator, Natalia and her grandfather who is a doctor. And the story involves the wars that have ravaged that area for years.

If you think back to the 1990s in the former Yugoslavia, you may remember the horror and shock of those years of unending war. The bombing of a 400 year old bridge, the massacres, the deadening of Sarajevo. While none of these events are overtly, or even covertly, covered in the novel, their echo remains. This is a novel whose strength lies in the ability to translate myth and fable, to make the moments that seem almost unknowable known. The excerpt offered in the beginning of this review is an example of that, the Grandfather takes the young Natalia past curfew to witness the surreal site of a starving elephant being led on the city streets to the closed city zoo, the place of their weekly pilgrimages. During mercurial times, there was this moment of placidity and fantasy. The war which raged and continued and was irrational as wars are, there is the fantastical presence of an elephant sloping up the quiet neighborhood street. While Natalia frets that no one will believe her, her grandfather corrects her idea by telling her that history can be something personalized and intimate. Not meant to be shared by the world, but by those who you love and trust to see your vision. It makes sense, because when histories are challenged and threatened, documents concerning your birth, the death of your families are challenged or lost, history becomes something far more ephemeral. Far more illusory unless it is placed in the permanence of your own heart.

She begins Chapter 2 by saying, “Everything necessary to understand my Grandfather lies between two stories: the story of the tiger’s wife, and the story of the deathless man” (32). So it is between these poles of myth and story that we can locate the history of this narrator and her grandfather, both physicians, both straddling the line between science and home remedy. I could tell you at length about both, but that truly would be spoiling the journey of the story for you. But I will say that the language Obreht uses is so languid and lush, masterful and mindful that you begin to be seduced by it all. So reason, the questions of markings of slippery occurrences of war that do belong to the world that could ground the reader in the world Obreht is translating is lost because that is the moment she is NOT choosing to share. But here is the thing. I needed it. Even in a footnote or an afterward. I needed a timeline of the events that brought the destruction of these people to such impossibilities of existence. Because even though it is a public history, it is one I do not know well. It would be wrong to assume the knowledge on the part of a Western audience I think, it’s unfortunate that this is not a familiar landscape or language. I know, in the recesses of my mind I know the wars in the Balkans. The horrors, the rape camps of Bosnia, the destruction, the evacuation of Serbians…but I don’t know enough, not nearly enough to be lulled into this lush tale. A part of me refused to be completely seduced by it. Because I didn’t understand enough about it.

There is a way in which myth sustains us when horrors are too much. When person and home and identity fall away, and where you cannot locate your birthplace on a map, because it has been eliminated, what do you hold onto except your stories? As the author writes, “We had used a the map on every road trip we had ever taken, and it showed in the marker scribbling all over it: the crossed-out areas we were supposed to avoid…. I couldn’t find Zdrevkov, the place where my grandfather died, on that map. I couldn’t find Brejevina either, but I had known in advance that it was missing, so we had drawn it in” (16). Map lines, map dots, erased and redrawn because of war. How do you locate who you are, if you cannot really know where you are from? The erasing of history, of place, of belonging, of self is such a legitimate tragic legacy of war. So it is understandable that the novel moves between these two myths to bookend it, asking the reader to locate the grandfather and the narrator in its midst. I just think that the novel, which is a remarkable achievement for such a young writer, would have been that much more strong, viscerally, had it had the historical reference points it alluded to. That being said, though, it is a novel of quiet questions and loud answers and makes you wonder long after you’ve set it aside. Questions like, “What is the moment you have? The one you find that belongs to you? Who will you share it with and what familiar myth might you create?”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Junior point guard Shelton Mitchell has gone from regional to national recruit over the last year.

On Friday night, Mitchell capped his rise when he announced via Twitter that he has committed to Wake Forest.

Mitchell drew college coaches from the Demon Deacons, North Carolina and North Carolina State to the Holiday Invitational at Raleigh (N.C.) Broughton High last week. He averaged 22.3 points per game with a high of 30 against Hampton (Va.) High and Wolfpack point guard signee Anthony Barber.

Mitchell said some of the college coaches gave him a heads up that they were coming to watch him.

""It was good, and I knew coming into this that during my whole high school career, I knew about this tournament and playing in front of big crowds,"" Mitchell said. ""I talked to [UNC assistant] Coach [C.B.] McGrath, [Wake Forest assistant] Coach [Jeff] Battle and Coach Roy [Williams of UNC], and they all said they were coming.""

When Mitchell plays with the Chris Paul All-Stars, he's more likely to aim for double-digit assist totals than gaudy scoring numbers.

""CP3, if they need me to score, I'll attack more and be aggressive, but with this team, [it's scoring] all the time,"" Mitchell said. ""CP3 has a lot of guys that can get hot and same with this team [at Cuthbertson]. I just have to be a little more aggressive with this team.""

Cuthbertson coach Mike Helms is appreciative of the work ethic and leadership Mitchell has displayed.

""Shelton is the hardest working kid I've ever coached,"" Helms said. ""The kid is back in the gym. He's texting me, 'How can I get back in the gym the next day?' He wants to get in there and get better in all facets of his game, and he has. He has continued to improve and knows there are areas he still needs to improve.

""He is a kid, I have no question he will reach his ceiling. He is going to be the best player he can be before it is all said and done.""

Rivals.com ranks the lanky 6-foot-3 point guard No. 60 in the country in the class of 2014. The Nike Elite 100, which took place in St. Louis last June, helped boost his stock nationally

""That was huge,"" Mitchell said. ""Playing then, I wasn't as known as I am now. Being able to go against guys that were ahead of me, and basically on the same path as me, and competing against them was huge.""

Mitchell has been well-known in Charlotte circles since playing in the eighth grade for Covenant Day and winning the Bob Gibbons Tournament of Champions. In that tournament, he played with Team United's Kennedy Meeks (UNC signee) and Sindarius Thornwell (South Carolina signee).

Mitchell grew up in Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Ore., before settling in the Charlotte area for middle school. He transferred to brand-new Cuthbertson High his ninth grade year and helped them finish second in the NCHSAA 2A playoffs. Cuthbertson fell to Kinston 58-55 in the title game, despite 22 points from Mitchell.

Cuthbertson and Kinston were able to renew their rivalry in the losers bracket at the Holiday Invitational. Mitchell and senior wing Isiah Cureton sparked a second half comeback to pull out a 50-47 win over Kinston back on Dec. 28. Mitchell had 19 points in the big win and looks like he has improved since last March.

""I've gotten a little stronger, though he [Helms] might not believe that,"" Mitchell said. ""I'm more mentally tough. Even when things aren't going my way, I still keep my head in the game. Last year, I think I got down on myself at times. This year, I just keep playing.""",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Words of Healing with Kaotik the Poet

Hey everybody I’m back again, and this time I got to speak with another inspirational artist that goes by, Kaotik the Poet. Our talk was very spiritually nourishing. We got a chance to speak about passions, desires, and inspirations. As well as, the power of expressing your thoughts through words. I believe people’s artistry can heal; therefore, I hope you are healed by our conversation with Kaotik the Poet.

Q: Can you please give use your name, background, business name, and business background?

A: My name is Louis Caldwell. I own Caldwell Services, and Sweet Lou’s Bar B Que. Caldwell Services is an automotive core purchasing service. I buy warranty parts from dealerships and sell them to rebuilders. I started these businesses because I wanted to leave something to my kids.

Q: Who is the Kaotik poet? How does he differ from you I everyday life?A: Lol, who is Kaotik Poet? He is the manifestation of my passions and desires. He is the compromise between flesh and spirit. My expression of self in its purest form. He is the moment that I leave this plane and mentally let it all hang out. I don’t have to dumb it down for others. I am him and he is me in many aspects, yet I am bridled somewhat in real life. I find myself having to hold back, lol, I don’t think the World is ready. Kaotik Poet does this on some levels as well. Some things they just can’t handle.

Q: Why do you leave your poetry without a title?A: Most of my poems are left without titles because, titles make them so impersonal. It’s like they have no beginning and no end. I don’t want to tell the reader what they’re about, I want their hearts to do that for me. Now mind you, In a lot of my earlier writing they have titles.

Q: Where does your inspiration to write come from? What is your creation process?

A: My inspiration to write comes from my past, present and hope for the future. It derives from an overwhelming need to teach, guide and love. Hmmmm, creation process, I don’t think I have one. It’s like my words just fall atop me all at once. I can be sleep and they come to me. I have dreamt of entire ideas for stories…lol. I know that sounds crazy but true. Someone may say something. I don’t know. The world feeds me its needs, and I am its speaker.

Q:When you state, “I just returned from war I did. With its smokey mouths and hidden lies. It’s hurried red lights and busy bodies with no business of their own. I just emerged from the battlefield where there were no soldiers, just drama Kings and Dairy Queens. From 9-5 I fought this war. From the country sides to the concrete jungles. I did indulge in civil gore,” what struggle did you overcome at that point?

A: This poem came to me while sitting at a red light. I am a people watcher. I sat and watched all of the soccer moms, the restless teens, the exhausted fathers. I saw how they all watched this red light. For that moment they all had one thing in common, that light. That light offered them a moment peace, which they rejected. I watched how they glared at one another. No love, no compassion. Like the light belonged to them. I then pushed on through my day and lent my attention to more observations. We fight our way through our days. Leaving behind casualties, whether it be emotionally, mentally or spiritually. We are on a course to slaughter one another. We are at war.

Q: What new projects are you working on? How can we expect your poetry to evolve?

A: Currently I am gathering up my writings. I have found someone to help me with editing and organization. The problem is there are over five hundred manuscripts that I know of. I have my work cut out for me. I believe my poetry will evolve into a more pure truth. I want to take some writing classes, but we will see. Whatever is in God’s will.

Q:What do you want people to take from your poetry?

A: I want people to take from my poetry, that they are not alone in any journey, any struggle. We have all gone through it. Don’t be afraid to speak your truths. I want them to know that I have lived every word I wrote. Know That I am my brother’s keeper, and he will be kept.

Hopefully you were touched and took something from the Kaotik Poet. Moving forward I hope you let your spirit free and can inspire through your words. If you were moved by this interview please follow Louis @kaotikpoet on Instagram. Tune in on Friday to hear from a visual artist Diane Roka. I will leave you with a poem by Kaotik the Poet!

Killing Me Slowly

Someone help me I’m bleeding words, my pen has become a scythe and it’s killing thoughts by the second. It’s a lyrical psychopath going straight for the jugular, it’s become a verbal juggernaut. I’m running but I’m in slow motion, my pen is in flow motion, with each poem it’s picking up momentum…. Someone help me, I’m bleeding words.

I am hemorrhaging words, my passion is falling away from me, help me, I struggle to catch my misery, I lay in a pool of ink, pumped from my flesh. From the center of my bones did this ink spill. Help me. With surgical precision this pen will expel my deepest pains. I’m dying indeed, my soul has been taken, I’mlying in need, I can’t feel my heart where my words did feed. Someone help me I’m bleeding words.

I have found my peace, do not mourn me, weep for my words for they are lost to my mind, they have known me for a time, but are now dead to me, I wade within the dark corridors, for I am sightless,, my words gave vision, but now I don’t feel clearly, I’m sightless, my purpose has departed. I’m fight less. I am beyond help I’m bleeding words.
When I have past the last wisp of my living breath, tell them of these words that did die. Lay me within a shallow keep where I may write from the grave, that I mayspeak from behind the vail of the permanent sleep, from the unending dream my words did form. Upon my stoned head, may my truths be perched, I will lay not where you searched, I’m lurking about the bones of the slumbering poets where sorrows are heard……I have bled my words……..LTC3",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Stool ova and parasites exam

Apr 30, 2005 Viewed: 267

Alternative names
Parasites and stool ova exam

Definition
Stool ova and parasites exam is a test for the presence of a parasite or worm-like infection of the intestine from stool analysis. Ova refers to the egg stage of a parasite’s life cycle. Some parasites are single-cell organisms such as amoeba, Giardia, and trichomonas, while others have a worm-like appearance.

How the test is performed
Adults and children:
There are many ways to collect the samples. You can catch the stool on plastic wrap that is loosely placed over the toilet bowl and held in place by the toilet seat. Then, put the sample in a clean container. One test kit supplies a special toilet tissue that you use to collect the sample, then put the sample in a clean container.

Infants and young children:
For children wearing diapers, line the diaper with plastic wrap. If the plastic wrap is positioned properly, isolating the stool from any urine output, mixing of urine and stool can be prevented for a better sample.

A small smear of stool is placed on a microscope slide and examined.

How to prepare for the test
You will be given a specimen container for the stool sample. Do not mix urine or toilet tissue in with the stool specimen.

How the test will feel
There is no discomfort.

Why the test is performed
The test is performed if a parasitic infestation is suspected, for prolonged diarrhea of unknown cause, or other intestinal symptoms.

Normal Values

The presence of normal bacteria and other microorganism in the stool is normal.

What abnormal results mean

Parasites or eggs are present in the stool indicating parasitic infestation.

Beschreibung

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a mold-BGA (ball grid array)-type semiconductor device and a method for making the same. BGA means to connect arranging an array of ball solders on a main plane of substrate.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A conventional mold-BGA-type semiconductor device is, as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B, structured by adhering a buffering elastic material called elastomer 10 onto the surface of a chip 1, thermo-compression-bonding a copper wiring 12 to a pad 2 of the chip 1, sealing with a sealant 13. FIG. 1A shows a state that the pad 2 is disposed at the center of the chip 1, and FIG. 1B shows a state that it is disposed peripherally.

Also, Japanese patent application laid-open Nos. 3-94438 (1991) and 8-204062 (1996) disclose examples of mold-BGA-type semiconductor devices where solder balls are disposed on the surface of resin package on the front-face side of semiconductor chip.

As one example of them, the semiconductor device disclosed in Japanese patent application laid-open No. 3-94438 (1991) is shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B. FIG. 2A is a cross sectional view showing the semiconductor device before forming the solder balls, and FIG. 2B is a cross sectional view showing the semiconductor device after forming the solder balls.

As shown in FIG. 2A, it is fabricated by forming a dummy support 15 uniting with a die pad 14 on which a semiconductor chip 1 is to be mounted, adhering the semiconductor chip 1 onto the die pad 14, bonding between the pad 2 of the semiconductor chip 1 and the dummy support 15 through a wire 5 (metal thin wire), resin-sealing the whole members. After resin-sealing, as shown in FIG. 2B, outsides from the line B-B′ and line C-C′ in FIG. 2A are cut down and separated, thereby allowing part where the semiconductor chip 1 is mounted to be remaining. The surface of the remaining part and the wire 5 are polished to expose the surface of wire 5 until having a predetermined thickness. Solder balls 6 are formed on the exposed and polished part of the wire 5.

However, in the BGA-type semiconductor device in FIGS. 1A and 1B, there are the problems that the cost for material becomes expensive because the wiring structure from the pad 2 to the solder ball 6 uses a polyimide tape 11 and the elastomer 10, and that the fabrication process is complicated because of the adhering structure.

Also, in the BGA-type semiconductor device in FIGS. 2A and 2B, there is the problem that the cost for material becomes expensive because the dummy support 15 is used.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a mold-BGA-type semiconductor device where the connection with solder ball through wire can be made at a lower cost.

It is a further object of the invention to provide a method for making a mold-BGA-type semiconductor device where the connection with solder ball through wire can be made at a lower cost.

According to the invention, a mold-BGA-type semiconductor device, comprises:

a semiconductor chip which includes insulating resin film formed on at least a part of the surface of the semiconductor chip except a pad;

a conductive layer formed in a region on the insulating resin film, the region including at least part corresponding to a position where a solder ball is mounted;

a first metal thin wire which is wire-bonded between the pad and the conductive layer;

a second metal thin wire which is wire-bonded on the conductive layer;

resin part which seals the semiconductor chip, the resin part including a hole to expose part of the second metal thin wire; and

a solder ball which is mounted on the hole.

According to another aspect of the invention, a method for making a mold-BGA-type semiconductor device, comprises the steps of:

forming insulating resin film on at least a part of the surface of a semiconductor chip except a pad;

wire-bonding between the pad and the conductive layer and wire-bonding on the conductive layer;

resin-sealing the semiconductor chip;

forming a hole through the sealing resin to expose part of a metal thin wire which is wire-bonded on the conductive layer; and

mounting a solder ball on the hole.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

The invention will be explained in more detail in conjunction with the appended drawings, wherein:

FIGS. 3A and 3B are a plan view and a cross sectional view showing a mold-BGA-type semiconductor device in a preferred embodiment according to the invention, and

FIGS. 4A to 4F are cross sectional views showing a method for making a mold-BGA-type semiconductor device in a preferred embodiment according to the invention.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

The preferred embodiments of the invention will be explained below, referring to the drawing.

FIG. 3A is a plan view showing a mold-BGA-type semiconductor device, whose resin is partly removed, in the embodiment of the invention, and FIG. 3B is a cross sectional view of FIG. 3A.

As shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B, laminated metal layer 4, such as aluminum, is formed by vapor deposition etc. on polyimide film 3 formed on a chip 1, connected with a pad 2 by a wire (metal thin wire) 5A. Further, on the laminated metal layer 4, inverted-U-shaped wiring is provided. Solder balls 6 are bonded to the inverted-U-shaped wire exposed by holing resin 7 after sealing with resin 7.

Next, a method for making the above mold-BGA-type semiconductor device will be explained using FIGS. 4A to 4F.

First, as shown in FIG. 4A, polyimide 3 is formed on the surface of the chip 1, and aluminum 4 is vapor-deposited at part to dispose the solder ball 6.

As shown in FIG. 4B, wire bonding from the pad 2 to the aluminum layer 4 is conducted with the wire 5A. The position of the pad 2 is varied depending on a circuit on the chip 1. Therefore, wiring to the part to dispose the solder ball 6 is conducted with the wire 5B. Next, as shown in FIG. 4C, wire bonding is conducted on the aluminum layer 4.

Further, as shown in FIG. 4D, resin sealing is conducted with resin 7. Then, as shown in FIG. 4E, a solder-ball hole 9 is formed by laser light 8 to expose part of the wire 5B formed in FIG. 4C. The solder-ball hole 9 can be also exposed by polishing, but it can be exposed without hurting the wire when using laser light. Finally, as shown in FIG. 4F, the solder ball 6 is mounted on the solder-ball hole 9.

Advantages of the Invention:

As explained above, in the present invention, due to a conductive layer formed on insulating resin film of chip, the cost of material for wire-binding can be reduced, thereby making the semiconductor device at lower cost. Also, the bonding of solder ball and metal thin wire can be easily conducted.

Although the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiment for complete and clear disclosure, the appended claims are not to be thus limited but are to be construed as embodying all modification and alternative constructions that may be occurred to one skilled in the art which fairly fall within the basic teaching here is set forth.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Stash Report

When I was going back and forth to my doctor appointments I’ve also been periodically stopping at the thrift stores. I was able to find some fabric. The purple floral is destine to be the back of the quilt…the purple plaid is flannel and I think that will back a baby quilt.

The others are just fabrics that will go into my collection.

While I was there I also found this…Goodies to make sock monkeys!!

There should be plenty of socks and stuffing to make two sock monkeys and that’s perfect. I think I’ll make them next Christmas..one will be for Carver and the other for Scott, Buck’s girlfriend’s little guy.

This all made me super happy. I’ve made a couple of sock monkeys before. They are quick, easy and lots of fun too. Now I have to somehow remember that I have the goodies and get them made. It’s a happy coincidence that they were there. I likely wouldn’t have thought of making them had I now found the socks.

To see what others are doing with their fabric collections check out Patchwork Times.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

This past week I kept it real easy since I am potty training my daughter. I knew it would suck up my daytime reading a lot with keeping a special eye on her. So far so good. Except for the other day when my older sister and I took her to get her Easter pictures done and were gone for five hours doing so; so her potty training was kind of put on pause.

Anyway, this past week I read and review two books. I also had to put The Opposite of Me to the side since two other books came in the mail for review and I only have a few days between the reviews.

Do you find yourself living in memories, imaginations, and fears more than in the current moment? As Dr. Warren W. Wiersbe writes, ""My past may discourage me and my future may frighten me, but 'the life I now live' today can be enriching and encouraging because 'Christ lives in me' (Gal. 2:20).""
In Jesus in the Present Tense, Dr. Wiersbe explores the I AM statements of God- from His burning-bush conversation with Moses, to His powerful reassurances to the Israelites to Jesus' startling claims to be the Light of the World, the Good Shepherd, and the True Vine.
The better you understand God's I AM statements from both the Old and New Testaments and apply their truths to your life, the more you will abide in Christ and bear fruit for His glory today. Then you will be free to live, serve, and know God more richly in the present tense- which is just where He wants you to be.

I loved this book. I honestly could not put it down. It was so interesting and educational and real. I didn't find it preachy either. I liked that Dr. Wiersbe had scriptures through-out the book to back up he was saying. He shows that just because the Bible is old and just because we aren't in those biblical times anymore, people dealt with most of the same issues we deal with today and how we can use His Word for our everyday life even if we think the Bible is outdated. The chapter I liked the most was chapter eight, "" The Way, The Truth and The Life."" He gave a full chapter to the I AM statements of Christ. Giving a bunch of scriptures backing them up then explaining the scriptures in such a way making them easy to understand and explain to other people which I found handy. I can't gush enough about this book! I soaked this book up in a couple of nights. I also found that this book would be good for a bible study group. He even has notes at the end of his book for each chapter. I am looking forward to reading more of Dr. Warren's books:) I would totally recommend this book, it wasn't boring in the least.

Presley Thurman, a sassy, thirty-something redhead, lover of shopping and Starbucks had just been fired so she decided to follow her dream. With her feisty nature and a spirit to not ""sweat the small stuff,"" she was ready to tackle any challenge (even if she had no idea how she would pay the bills). However, the new job turned into murder-in her hometown! Presley was excited - she hadn't seen so much buzz since the spring sample sale at Saks.
Presley was able to discover the Senators wife, Helen, had been having an affair...with her best friend's boyfriend! Did Helen kill the Senator? Or was it the Senators love of gambling that got him killed? And what was Cooper's secret tie to the mob boss Garrison Palozzo? But could she find the killer and write her story while resisting the good looks and charm of old flame Cooper.
Presley was betting her favorite pair of Manolo's she will find the killer...but will time run out?

* * *

I was pleasantly surprised with this book. I'm not usually a fan of books with romance being a main key in the storyline. Yet I fully enjoyed this read. I loved the mystery and shoes;) And even though I had a hunch what may take place or not take place, I had to keep reading to find out for sure. Laina really does have a gift for writing this style of book.

I enjoyed the main character, Presley. She is independent and goes after what she wants. She deals with what I think all women who get to a certain age that are single deal with. And that is that their mother won't stop trying to connect them to men they think are right for them because they want to see their daughter(s) happy and they want grand-kids. Heck, I know some mothers who ask if the man is single (and after getting a yes) shove him at their daughters lol.

I loved how real and well developed the characters were. I could see myself at the cafe with Presley having a large black coffee with cream and two sugars talking about all the men in the town or sitting at her and her best friend growing up Katy's table at La Casa sipping on a margarita looking at the all the men and getting filled in on all the gossip while wishing I had half of Presley's wardrobe or Katy's figure lol! I could get along with Presley and a few of her friends but Presley's ex Brian seemed a bit immature and desperate; especially after they had gone out for coffee. They hadn't seen each other in a few years and he got upset and left her stranded at the coffee shop because she wasn't for getting back together. I also think that it was a hidden blessing that Presley got the online magazine job that sent her back to her hometown for a few days because Presley did a lot of growing up and finding out who she was and growing more confident in herself and in her own skin and not just portraying it on the outside or convincing herself that she was happy.

You gotta read this book. Bottom line. Laina has a great writing style and seems to have a knack for making her characters real and imaginative. I would recommend this book and I can't wait for her next book! I have added Laina as a 'fav author'. This was a fun read with twists and turns and I couldn't wait for her next book:) I like this Presley Thurman;)

What great books did you hear about/discover this past week? Share with us your FRIDAY FINDS! :D

After reading Possession by Rene Gutteridge I went to see is she had any other books out. I had a dork moment and instead of typing her name I typed Snitch. That, to my surprise had a few responses that I have added to my tbr not only because of what the book is about but because (yes I am a book cover snob!) either I liked the cover and/or it intrigued me. One made me raise an eyebrow and I am willing to bet you can figure which had this affect on me. So my first few friday finds are by different authors same title:

A book by Desi Arnaz looks interesting to me because he called it A Book. And I haven't read any of his work yet but I like the movies I have seen him in so far so I want to check that one out as well.

Hon Hoh, a teacher of the Revelation, takes readers on a riveting journey

Do each of us play a role in the kingdom of God? Can the choices we make affect God’s timing of future events? Hon Hoh examines these questions while taking his readers on a riveting adventure in The Trigger: A Novel on the Revelation. Through twists and turns, readers will be led on a powerful journey.

The Trigger follows three individuals (a pastor, a spy, and a missionary) from three continents (the United States, China, and Australia) who find their lives merged in a single divine purpose: to win the last unreached people group on earth and usher in the Second Coming of Christ. They must succeed in order to release the trigger for the return of the Lamb as declared in Matthew 24:14.

In their way stands a legion of demonic principalities intent on destroying the plan. Against the backdrop of unprecedented persecution and the onslaught of cataclysmic events, they must remain steadfast in order to carry out the priority revealed to them by God. It is evident that no believer will escape the greatest tribulation in human history and that only the matchless return of the King can deliver mankind from evil’s reign.

The climactic battle between Good and Evil unfolds as Lucifer executes his definitive act of defiance: the global genocide of all Christians. With the sound of the trumpets reverberating throughout the heavens, the events that have been set in motion must now complete their course. Eternity and the fate of the earth are at stake, and there is no plan B.

Far more than just another End-Times novel and theologically distinct from the Left Behind series, Hoh will alter the way you see the world and prepare you for the future. This novel is based closely on Hoh’s theology expressed in his book Risen Lamb, Empowered Saints: The Book of Revelation Made Easy.Although the events described are entirely fictional, they are but one of many plausible scenarios in which the end could occur. Though these depictions may not arise for more than another hundred years, it is conceivable that they could begin to unfold within the next decade—or less.

Hoh has written a thought-provoking and exciting novel that looks at the events leading up to the Second Coming and challenges us all to follow the plans that Christ has for our lives.

It’s Monday! What Are You Reading is where we share what we read this past week, what we hope to read this week…. and anything in between! D This is a great way to plan out your reading week and see what others are currently reading as well… you never know where that next “must read” book will come from!

I feel very good about myself this week with bookish things. Because Hubby and I moved a few weeks ago I have been busy with unpacking, putting away, organizing, getting new things for our place plus keeping up with life. That said, this past week I posted two reviews:

Imagine that it is just you and God…Have you ever looked into the night sky and asked, ""Why?"" It's not unusual to ask questions. But it's rare to find reliable answers since so many of our questions involve difficult issues or mysteries too great for our comprehension. But there is One who knows. A Conversation with God was created because life is challenging and your heart longs to understand. In this book you will find fifty-five of life's greatest questions and the answers you've been seeking about the past, the present, and the future.

This book wasn't quite what I thought it was going to be. It was better. I couldn't read it fast enough. I loved how the author really made you feel like you reading one of those Q and A's you read about authors, celebrities and such. It didn't feel preachy either and I liked that. It makes it easier for me to recommend this book to people who aren't sure about God and His hand in the why, where, how and why, etc. It was a fun, delightful, educational and informative read that was a complete page turner. I read it in a couple of nights while lying in bed. The first night I got into bed around midnight, picked it up to look it over and get a feel of the book. The next thing I know it's two thirty in the morning and I am about halfway through the book. I loved how the author wrote it in a conversation style. I loved the questions he brought up. Like, are we really living in the end time? If you love us, why do we suffer? There are so many religions, an each says it's the only one that has things right. Is there just one way to heaven, or do they all work? There are so many other questions with answers from the Bible with scripture(s) where to find the answer(s).

Bottom line, it's a reference book in conversation style. And I loved it. I highly recommend this read to everyone. This is a good resource to use for kids askingtough questions, Bible study groups or for your own study, debates, etc. I lent it to my older nephew who has questions and he told me just last night that so far it is being a big help and that he likes that it isn't preachy and tell you where to find it in the Bible.

Medical students are taught that when they hear hoof beats, they should think horses, not zebras, but Dr. House's unique talent of diagnosing unusual illnesses has made House, M.D. one of the most popular and fascinating series on television. Inside this book, Barbara Barnett, widely considered a leading House expert, takes fan deep into the heart of the show's central character and his world, examining the way the medical Sherlock Holmes colleagues and patients reflect him and each other; how the music, settings, and even the humor enhances our understanding of the series' narrative; what the show says about modern medicine, ethics, and religion; and much more.

When I first saw the opportunity to read and review this book, I was excited. I haven't ever really seen the show. But I know people who like the show and follow it. So I figured reading this book was a way for me to see what everyone is talking about. To get the inside look on the show and characters. To see what all the fuss is about.

I have learned that finding the person to play the main character (Dr. House) wasn't easy because he isn't the pretty guy type (but not ugly either). House' character has horrible bedside manners, he rude, a pill popper and is a cripple that walks with a cane.

I also learned that he seems to have a niche for solving medical cases at the last moment. He doesn't go for simple. He digs beneath the surface. And he usually gets little faith from his colleagues/friends for his ways of doing things and his ideas of what is wrong with a patient and how to fix them. But he is usually right.

I had so much fun reading this book. I also think I am going to start watching the program and be able to talk with family and friends about the show. Especially my father; he thinks that House is the biggest jerk but is absolutely addicted to the show. He is now reading Chasing Zebra's.

I like the cover of this book. I think it is very fitting. I would recommend this book to pretty much anyone; in particular to people who like the show or House himself of course.

I’ve been really looking forward to the release of this book and it’s finally here in paperback as well as ebook. The ebook has been out for ages, but I saved mentioning it here until the print edition was available too. It contains my story, “Shadows of the Lonely Dead”, which is probably the most personal story I’ve ever written. I drew extensively on my experiences surrounding the deaths of people very close to me in the writing of it. It’s sharing the pages with a plethora of amazing people and I’m sure their stories will be excellent. Here’s the skinny and some sweet blurbs:

Unnaturals

Unnaturals tried to kill Mason Douglas and his family. Big mistake.

He became The Butcher, a cold relentless Hunter with a vendetta that took him across the world.

And now, on his return home to Australia – to mend his heart, soul and family – his destiny collides with a millennia-old struggle between strange Gods.

Their prize is Earth. Their warriors are warring races of Unnaturals: the Bloodells and the Darkells.

As an unlikely alliance forms between Natural and Unnatural – between the Douglas clan and the Darkells – Mason’s family grows in unexpected ways… not all of whom are human.

In a far future where technology is all but indistinguishable from magic, Tanyana is one of the elite. She can control pions, the building blocks of matter, shaping them into new forms using ritual gestures and techniques. The rewards are great, and she is one of most highly regarded people in the city. But that was before the “accident”. Stripped of her powers, bound inside a bizarre powersuit, she finds herself cast down to the very lowest level of society. Powerless, penniless and scarred, Tanyana must adjust to a new life collecting “debris”, the stuff left behind by pions. But as she tries to find who has done all of this to her, she also starts to realize that debris is more important than anyone could guess.

The bitter war between the sinister Puppet Men and the nebulous Keeper for the control of the ancient city of Movoc-under-Keeper has intensified. For Tanyana, imprisoned within her extraordinary suit and cast down as a lowly debris collector, choosing a side should be simple. But when even her own suit becomes aggressive against her, Tanyana must weigh some very personal issues against her determination to serve the greater good.

The grand city of Movoc-under-Keeper lies in ruins. The sinister puppet men have revealed their true nature, and their plan to tear down the veil between worlds. To have a chance of defeating them, Tanyana must do the impossible, and return to the world where they were created, on the other side of the veil. Her journey will force her into a terrible choice, and test just how much she is willing to sacrifice for the fate of two worlds.

Enter a world where terrible secrets are hidden in a wind chime’s song

Where crippled witches build magic from scrap

And the beautiful dead dance for eternity

The Bone Chime Song and Other Stories collects the finest science fiction and horror short stories from award-winning writer Joanne Anderton. From mechanical spells scavenging a derelict starship to outback zombies and floating gardens of bone, these stories blur the lines between genres. A mix of freakish horror, dark visions of the future and the just plain weird, Anderton’s tales will draw you in – but never let you get comfortable.

Alex Caine is a martial artist fighting in illegal cage matches. His powerful secret weapon is an unnatural vision that allows him to see his opponents’ moves before they know their intentions themselves.

An enigmatic Englishman, Patrick Welby, approaches Alex after a fight and reveals, ‘I know your secret.’ Welby shows Alex how to unleash a breathtaking realm of magic and power, drawing him into a mind-bending adventure beyond his control. And control is something Alex values above all else.

A cursed grimoire binds Alex to Uthentia, a chaotic Fey godling, who leads him towards destruction and murder, an urge Alex finds harder and harder to resist. Befriended by Silhouette, a monstrous Kin beauty, Alex sets out to recover the only things that will free him – the shards of the Darak. But that powerful stone also has the potential to unleash a catastrophe which could mean the end of the world as we know it.

Alex Caine is looking for direction and trying to build a new life with his recently acquired magical talents, and Kin girlfriend, Silhouette. He is recruited by a secret organisation to head off an impending doom, foretold by Seers as already somehow linked to his destiny. Claude Darvill is desperately trying to get in touch with his father, Robert Hood. When the company, Black Diamond, reveals that Hood had gone missing after chasing Alex Caine, Darvill takes over control of Black Diamond and starts hunting Caine himself. Alex and his crew close in on three amateur mages in Britain’s north, who think they have uncovered ancient magic that will reveal great powers. But they are caught in a vortex and pulled through to a strange lost city, isolated in the void. Trapped in a place removed from everything they know, ruled by a hierarchy of monsters, Alex and his friends must find a way to escape Obsidian.

Alex Caine has been suffering the weight of the world, and some days it’s hard to even get out of bed. Alone one night, a band of Fey overwhelm him and steal him away from the mortal realm. Silhouette, desperate to save her lover, calls in Armour, but the organisation seems reluctant to help.

Claude Darvill, his fragile alliance with Alex at an end, is still searching for the remains of his father, Robert Hood. In frozen wastes of Iceland, Darvill is driven by a deep-burning grudge and a need for revenge. His efforts are backed by all the considerable resources of Black Diamond Incorporated.

Silhouette must overcome her greatest fears and use all her skills to locate Alex. But even if she can find him, that’s only the start of their problems.

In this third Alex Caine book, sequel to the bestsellers Bound and Obsidian, old enemies and new share a common goal. Alex Caine hates to be the centre of attention, but he and Silhouette need to pull together as the world is threatened once more and only Alex can save it.

The future does not belong to us anymore. The mighty Wolfen of Valkeryn, descendants of the canines of the era of man, have ruled for many millennia. But now their kingdom has fallen to the monstrous hordes and the remaining Wolfen scattered.

Arnold ‘Arn’ Singer, a youth from the past and perhaps the last human being alive on the planet, finds himself cast into this maelstrom of chaos and horror. He seeks answers to the missing Ancients – mankind itself. But back in his time the world continues to destabilize. The portal through which he fell is destroying the planet. The portal must be closed. Arn holds the key, and our world and its future is at stake.

Colonel Marion Briggs leads a team of Special Operations soldiers into the distant future, fully armed and with one order – bring back Arn or his body.

But there are more dangers in this strange and beautiful world than anyone knew. More horrors dwell in the deep jungles, below the inland seas and deep below the earth. There are things that can change the shape of two worlds, tear at sanity, and stretch friendships and loves to the limit.

Valkeryn is an epic adventure that spans worlds and time itself.

“… mixed in fantasy with hard, biological, and evolutionary science. Beck has yet again created fast-paced, literary escape that I just couldn’t put down.”

Meanwhile, far across the western desert, Ain, a young Pathfinder, is thrust into the role of Seeker. Before winter storms close the way, he must leave his home on a quest to locate the Sea Shrine and take revenge on the people who drove his ancestors from Anaskar, the city ruled by the prince Sofia and Notch are sworn to protect, whether he wants their help or not.

Caeli-Amur: an ancient city perched on white cliffs overlooking the sea; a city ruled by three Houses, fighting internecine wars; a city which harbours ancient technology and hidden mysteries. But things are changing in Caeli-Amur. Ancient minotaurs arrive for the traditional Festival of the Sun. The slightly built New-Men bring their technology from their homeland. Wastelanders stream into the city hideously changed by the chemical streams to the north. Strikes break out in the factory district.

In a hideout beneath the city, a small group of seditionists debate ways to overthrow the Houses. How can they rouse the citizens of the city? Should they begin a campaign of terror? Is there a way to uncover the thaumaturgical knowledge that the Houses guard so jealously? As the Houses scramble to maintain their rule, it becomes clear that things will change forever in Caeli-Amur.

What would you do if you woke in a room filled with strangers, with no memory of how you got there, and no way out?

Morgan Drimmel wakes to find herself in the midst of this nightmare. The gouged, blood-splattered walls scream of terror and torture, and the unrelenting light that shines between the cracks in the walls fills her with dread.

When the others in the room wake, they form alliances, and Morgan finds herself drawn to rogue biker Slade Rivers. But dependence, for her, has always come with a deadly price.
Those inside the room have secrets too; dark secrets they will go to any length to keep from getting out. When evil rears its ugly head, Morgan will not only have to fight to survive—she will also have to trust.

So Clarice makes a deal with the Devil: the soul of her greatest enemy for a record deal and a second chance.

As Clarice and her band, Bloody Waters, begin their ascent to rock stardom they are are beset by a strange array of enemies. Has-been guitar heroes, popstar succubi, spell-slinging DJs, angry divas and killer angels—every occult freak and music industry player in LA wants something from them, whether it’s a slice of their fame or a bite out of their souls.

Clearly, there’s more at stake than just a record deal—but what does the Devil really want, and how far will Clarice go to protect what’s hers?

His stories tear the masks off our civilised faces and expose the raw, bleeding apes beneath” – Sean Williams, New York Times Bestselling author of Star Wars: The Force Unleashed and the Books of the Cataclysm series.

“Paul Haines has an unnerving sense for the softest, most secret corners of the male psyche, and in this collection dissects them excruciating skill. There is no better horror writer working in Australia today.” – Max Barry, author of Syrup and Jennifer Government.

Lisa L Hannett’s debut collection, Bluegrass Symphony, deals with cowboys and fallow fields, shapeshifters and rednecks, superstitions and realities in harsh prairie country — and a whole bunch of other things thrown in the mix.

Introduction by Ann Vandermeer.

Finalist for the World Fantasy Award. Winner of the Aurealis Award for Best Collection.

In The Female Factory, procreation is big business. Children are a commodity few women can afford.

Hopeful mothers-to-be try everything. Fertility clinics. Pills. Wombs for hire. Babies are no longer made in bedrooms, but engineered in boardrooms. A quirk of genetics allows lucky surrogates to carry multiple eggs, to control when they are fertilised, and by whom—but corporations market and sell the offspring. The souls of lost embryos are never wasted; captured in software, they give electronics their voice. Spirits born into the wrong bodies can brave the charged waters of a hidden billabong, and change their fate. Industrious orphans learn to manipulate scientific advances, creating mothers of their own choosing.

From Australia’s near-future all the way back in time to its convict past, these stories spin and sever the ties between parents and children.

When Mymnir flees the devastation of Ragnarok, she hopes to escape all that bound her to ?sgar?r ? a heedless pantheon, a domineering brother, and her neglectful father-master, ??inn. But the white raven, a being of memory and magic, should know that the past is not so easily left behind. No matter how far she flies, she cannot evade her family?

In planting seeds of the old world in the new, Mymnir becomes queen of a land with as many problems as the one she fled. Her long-lived Fae children ignite and fan feuds that span generations; lives are lost and loves won because of their tampering. Told in thirteen parts, Midnight and Moonshine follows the Beaufort and Laveaux families, part-human, part-Fae, as they battle, thrive and survive in Mymnir’s kingdom.

Midnight and Moonshine is a collection of interconnected tales with links between them as light and strong as spider-silk. From fire giants to whispering halls, disappearing children to evening-wolves, fairy hills to bewitched cypress trees, and talking heads to moonshiners of a special sort, Midnight and Moonshine takes readers on a journey from ninth century Vinland to America?s Deep South in the present day. Hannett and Slatter have created a mosaic novel of moments, story-tiles as strange as witchwood and withywindles.

Midnight and Moonshine is a rich tapestry of dark fantasy, fairy tale and speculation.

One false step could undo everything the Timekeepers hope to accomplish…

Earth’s ancient past, the future of the planet Kila – the Timekeepers universe of origin, the primordial era when the Nefilim first ruled the galaxy and a timeless universe of utter darkness are all vital periods to advancing human consciousness.

After surviving Ancient Zhou, the Timekeeper’s efforts turn to rescuing Kila from its ill-fated future. But a mishap in the remote mountains of Tibet before departure provides a nemesis with the perfect opportunity to launch a time-hopping vendetta against them. There is no where in this universe to hide.

The discovery of a gate thought to lead to several universes promises more than just the means to undermine their stalker; it offers the chance to remember their lives as the Grigori, who once dwelt with the fallen Elohim in the dark universe beyond the Eternity Gate.

Steam clouds rise off the water as a ferry approaches a jetty in ancient China. On board is Hudan, one of the mysterious Wu who reside on the sacred mountain of Li Shan.

The Wu have been living in isolation for decades, while the arrogant Shang emperor and his enchantress have ruled the land. It has been a terrible time for the common people and the noble Ji brothers – Dan and Fa – are keen to bring the emperor’s reign of terror to an end. They are told a Wu prophecy has predicted the fall of the emperor, but first they must journey to Li Shan to learn the truth.

When the Ji brothers join forces with the enigmatic Hudan and her equally mysterious tiger sister, Huxin, they begin a powerful journey of love and adventure.

But the Shang emperor is not their greatest threat. There is a dark curse that has plagued the rulers of the land for generations. The mysterious Sons of the Sky who visit Hudan in her dreams have a plan to destroy it., but can they be trusted?

Dreaming of Zhou Gong is a beautiful, evocative journey through ancient China.

Lissa Wilson’s life hasn’t been quite the same since people she cared about started getting themselves killed.

By vampires.

And Lissa learnt that the opposite of life is not always death. On the plus side, she made a new friend.
Gary Hooper may be the worst best-friend a librarian could have – and easily the worst vampire ever – but he has taught Lissa the real meaning of life. Gary’s world view has also improved remarkably since meeting Lissa, but all that could be lost if she discovers what services he provides Melbourne’s undead community.
Meanwhile, as their friendship brings him closer to the humanity he lost, it also puts them both in grave danger.
And there’s a big chance that the evil stalking them could them both killed – in his case, for good this time.

Fifty years after a second Dark Age has nearly destroyed humankind, the World Union is now confronted with a new threat that doesn’t just challenge their survival but also the nature of life and civilisation itself.

The Hunt for Pierre Jnr is the first book in a trilogy of futurist thrillers that follows the attempts of a powerful world government to track down and kill a telepathic eight-year-old boy.

In Manifestations, a mysterious new threat has been unleashed that destroys an entire city. As tensions with the psis rise and political fortunes shift, the World Union appears perilously close to collapse.

From geopolitical convergence to emergent online super organisms, the future is coming. Henley’s books explore themes of technological evolution, species diversification and takes the ‘all-powerful creepy child’ theme to a scary new level.

In a land where no stars appear in the night sky, a group of strangers with ancestries reaching back to an earlier apocalyptic disaster come together to track down a resurrected corpse whose very existence portends the End of the World. Fragments of a Broken Land: Valarl Undead is an epic tale of greed, dying magic, distorted monstrosities and a motley group of heroes, with a strange and breathless climax you won’t easily forget.

“This is a tale of heroes. It includes all sorts — born of the gods, descended from ancient, magical bloodline, member of a legendary order, reincarnated, last of their tribe and way too intimate with their own sentient weapon — cycling through various degrees of reluctant and unlikely. There is a villain, of course, although he’s thoroughly sick of the whole business; dark gods, giant monsters and an ancient magical artefact. But principally it is a tale of heroes, heroism and what it means to be in such an uncomfortable position.” (Review, Kyla Ward)

She hates school and only has a few friends. She has an obsession with angels and fallen angel stories.

Life was boring until she one day decided to steal a famous painting from a small art gallery.

Her life will never be boring again.

She meets a stranger at the gallery who claims to know her. She stumbles into a world where cities float in the sky, and daemons roam the barren, magma-spewing crags of the land far below.

But not all is well. Maree is turning into something she loves but at the same time, fears. Most fearful of all is the prospect of losing her identity, what makes her Maree, and more importantly, human.

Guardian of the Sky Realms takes the reader on a journey through exotic fantasy lands, as well as across the globe, from Sydney to Paris, from the Himalayas to Manhattan.

He thought he’d return from Hell a hero. But things are never easy when your business is Death.

On remote Rollrock Island, the sea-witch Misskaella discovers she can draw a girl from the heart of a seal. So, for a price, any man might buy himself a bride; an irresistibly enchanting sea-wife. But what cost will be borne by the people of Rollrock – the men, the women, the children – once Misskaella sets her heart on doing such a thing?Margo Lanagan weaves an extraordinary tale of desire and revenge, of loyalty, heartache and human weakness, and of the unforeseen consequences of all-consuming love.

Daniel Rolan is bored. Not your average, everyday kind-of bored. The seriously mind-blowing I’m-stuck-here-at-the-end-of-the-universe-surrounded-by-nerds kind of bored. Living on a space station might sound like an adventure straight out of a science fiction movie, but in reality – as Daniel was discovering day after boring day – it was really, well… mostly boring.

But Daniel will soon come to regret wishing for an action and adventure filled life. One seemingly innocent decision – and a catastrophe he could not have foreseen – is about to change his world forever.

It will set him on a path he never imagined, introduce him to new friends and even aliens he could not have thought up in his wildest dreams. Eventually it will even challenge his notion of where the end of the universe actually is.

Meanwhile, on the alien world of Nomassaii, the larger of the two planets through the Veil, Jacdan would love a bit of boredom. He has far more action and adventure in his life than he’d like. Sentenced to die in the arena, he’s fighting – battle by battle – to survive another day. But it’s one thing to fight for your own life – quite another to discover you are fighting for your little brother’s life, as well.

These alien worlds are about to collide, changing the lives of Daniel and Jacdan forever.

In a post-apocalyptic Australian landscape dominated by free-wheeling cyborgs, a young man goes in search of his lost lover who has been kidnapped by a rogue AI truck – the Brumby King. Along the way, he teams with Sinnerman, an independent truck with its own reasons for hating the Brumby King. Before his final confrontation with the brumbies, he must learn more about the broken-down world and his own place in it, and face his worst fears.

I am in a world deeply strange and strangely deep, a world as different from my old life as it’s possible to be, and it feels completely natural.

An unexpected encounter with a handsome stranger in a Russian wood changes the life of 22-year-old traveler Helen Clement forever, catapulting her into a high-stakes world of passion, danger, and mystery. Tested in ways she could never have imagined, she must keep her own integrity in a world where dark forces threaten and ruthlessness and betrayal haunt every day.

Set against a rising tide of magic and the paranormal in a modern Russia where the terrifying past continually leaks into the turbulent present, Trinity is a unique and gripping blend of conspiracy thriller, erotically charged romance and urban fantasy, laced with a murderous dose of company politics. With its roots deep in the fertile soil of Russian myth, legend, and history, it is also a fascinating glimpse into an extraordinary, distinctive country and amazingly rich culture.

‘A deftly woven tale of warring kingdoms and the redeeming power of love. Another winner from Sophie Masson.’ – Juliet Marillier, author of the Shadowfell series .

Antoinette and Jacqueline have little in common beyond a mutual antipathy for their paranoid, domineering mother, a bond which has united them since childhood. In the aftermath of a savage betrayal, Antoinette lands on her sister’s doorstep bearing a suitcase and a broken heart.

But Jacqueline, the ambitious would-be manager of a trendy Melbourne art gallery, has her own problems – chasing down a delinquent painter in the sweltering heat of a Brisbane summer. Abandoned, armed with a bottle of vodka and her own grief-spun desires, Antoinette weaves a dark and desperate magic that can never, ever be undone.

Their lives swiftly unravelling, the two sisters find themselves drawn into a tangle of lies, manipulations and the most terrible of family secrets.”

The debut collection from multi-award nominated author Andrew J McKiernan brings together 14 of his previously published short stories and novelettes, plus two brand new tales unique to the collection.

Often defying conventions of genre and style, these stories range from fantasy and steampunk to science fiction and horror, but always with an edge sharper than a razor and darker than a night on Neptune.

From the darkly hilarious “All the Clowns in Clowntown” to the heart-breakingly disturbing title story, the collection pulls no punches. Delving deep into what scares us most, McKiernan’s tales are by turns heartfelt and gut-wrenching.
With an Introduction by Will Elliott, Last Year, When We Were Young is a collection of horror and dark fantasy from one of Australia’s finest new authors that should not be missed.

There are people involved. That’s the first mistake. Scientists were never meant to be part of history. Anything in the past is better studied from the present.
It’s safer.
When a team of Australian scientists – and a lone historian – travel back to St-Guilhem-le-Désert in 1305 they discover being impartial, distant and objective just doesn’t work when you’re surroundedby the smells, dust and heat of a foreign land.

They’re only human after all.

But by the time Artemisia is able to convince others that it’s time to worry, it’s already too late.

‘Viscerally powerful, deeply felt, strongly written: Langue[dot]doc 1305 challenges reader expectations of time travel, of ‘Grim-dark’ and of mediaeval life and brings a haunting, authentic voice both to the past and to the struggles facing the present.’

Elizabeth Smith, recently made redundant, thinks that her life is deadly dull. She feels like cellophane like people look right through her, like she’s not even there. A simple redecoration job involving a mirror turns her life upside down.

Through ominous horror and an unexpected romance Liz learns to become a whole person someone who takes up space in the world, and demands to be herself.

Part gentle love story, part bizarre horror tale, but never, ever boring, Ms Cellophane is a revealing look at one woman’s nightmare transforming her reality in unexpectedly amusing ways.

In 2010 the best-selling book at the world science fiction convention was…unexpected.

Humankind carries the past as invisible baggage. Thirteen brilliant writers explore this, looking at Australia’s cultural baggage through new and often disturbing eyes.

Baggage explores layers and complexities that are oddly Australian. If you think Australian culture is all about surfboards and mateship, you may find Baggage distressing.

What is Australia? What baggage do Australians carry? Pick up this book. Have a read. You know you want to.

“Baggage collects many of the finest voices in Australian speculative fiction. Each author contributes a unique cultural perspective, with stories ranging from the deeply personal to the highly disturbing. Baggage is an anthology not to be missed.”

Shane Jiraya Cummings, OzHorrorScope

“Baggage is a fascinating exploration of Australian issues through characters and situations that feel immediate and real. There’s little in the way of escapism here, but instead much subtlety and nuance, combined with stunning writing. From the incendiary, no-holds-barred ‘Acception’ by Tessa Kum to the quiet power of K.J. Bishop’s ‘Vision Splendid’, and beyond, this anthology tackles difficult and diverse subject matter.”

Rawk is one of the great Heroes. He has travelled the world for forty years, hunting exotic creatures, battling magic and fighting evil wherever he found it. But he has been fighting mostly mundane battles since Prince Weaver outlawed magic. And with no great deeds left to be done, Rawk is afraid he’ll soon be the old man in the corner of the tavern, dreaming of the good old days and telling tales for anyone who will buy him a drink.

But when a huge wolden wolf is spied from the walls of Katamood for the first time in a decade, Rawk is the man the city looks to once more. He’ll save them. He always has.

Rawk will fight to ensure the Age of Heroes doesn’t slip away into history, but what if the good old days aren’t quite as good as he remembers?

Welcome back to the magic and pathos of Angela Slatter’s exquisitely imagined tales.

The Bitterwood Bible and Other Recountings returns to the world of Sourdough and Other Stories (Tartarus, 2010), introducing readers to the tales that came before. Stories where coffin-makers work hard to keep the dead beneath; where a plague maiden steals away the children of an ungrateful village; where poison girls are schooled in the art of assassination; where pirates disappear from the seas; where families and the ties that bind them can both ruin and resurrect and where books carry forth fairy tales, forbidden knowledge and dangerous secrets.

The Bitterwood Bible and Other Recountings is enhanced by eighty-six pen-and-ink illustrations by artist Kathleen Jennings.

In the cathedral-city of Lodellan and its uneasy hinterland, babies are fashioned from bread, dolls are given souls and wishes granted may be soon regretted. There are ghosts who dream, men whose wings have been clipped and trolls who long for something other. Love, loss and life are elegantly dissected in Slatter’s earthy yet poetic prose.

Blurb Black-Winged Angels is a collection of 10 incredible contemporary retellings of fairy tales, and will be available in a limited hardcover edition illustrated by the multiple World Fantasy Award nominated Kathleen Jennings.

The book will appeal to fans of Angela Carter (“The Company of Wolves”) and Emma Donoghue (“Kissing the Witch”).

Murder and betrayal in deep space, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance…

Thirty-four light years from Earth, the explorer ship Magellan is nearing its objective – the Iota Persei system. But when ship commander Cait Dyson wakes from deepsleep, she finds her co-pilot dead and the ship’s AI unresponsive. Cait works with the rest of her multinational crew to regain control of the ship, until they learn that Earth is facing total environmental collapse and their mission must change if humanity is to survive.

As tensions rise and personal and political agendas play out in the ship’s cramped confines, the crew finally reach the planet Horizon, where everything they know will be challenged.

“Refreshingly plausible, politically savvy, and full of surprises, Horizon takes you on a harrowing thrill-ride through the depths of space and the darkness of the human heart.” – Sean Williams, New York Times bestselling author of the Astropolis and Twinmaker series

Journey beyond the borders of the real with our first annual collection of stories appearing in Dimension6 magazine, with all new stories from some of the best speculative fiction authors working in Australia today including Richard Harland, Dirk Strasser, Jason Nahrung, Alan Baxter, Robert Hood, Cat Sparks, Robert N Stephenson, Steve Cameron and Charlotte Nash.

A businessman staying in a Scottish manor makes the mistake of deciding to spend the evening in the library. A group of unpopular teenage girls uses witchcraft to pursue their aims. A rich banking tycoon has forgotten his university days when he and his friends dared to imagine a world ruled by social justice and working class ideals. The estranged family of a deceased aristocrat bicker over their inheritance. A botanist’s love for his plants is unnaturally deep-rooted.

“Hoffman’s Creeper and Other Disturbing Tales” is the first short story collection from Cameron Trost. It plunges the reader into a world of mystery, suspense, obsession and greed. From the Scottish highlands and the jagged peaks of the Pyrénées to the streets of Brisbane and the Australian countryside, Cameron Trost provokes the reader by ensnaring recognisable characters in disturbingly plausible situations. His writing seeks to entertain while exploring the absurdities and peculiarities of society and the human mind.

Subtropical Suspense Anthology of Suspense and Mystery Tales set in Brisbane

“Cameron Trost has brought together a dark pantry of crime stories and mysteries, and cooked up a gumbo rich and spicy enough to befit any of the world’s sultry cities… but these happen to be set in Brisbane. Sixteen short stories take the reader from Morningside to Indooroopilly, from Hamilton to Acacia Ridge. There is baking sun and flooding rains, police procedurals and criminal capers, murderous mermaids and poison pens… all give a ripple of pleasure to the reader who knows Brisbane – or wants to know it – and who has wondered why stories of murder, malice, and magic couldn’t be set here. And of course, they should be: Brisbane’s shadows are as dark and good to hide in as any in the world – and Subtropical Suspense revels in this.”

Clair and Jesse have barely been reunited when the world is plunged into its biggest crisis yet … It’s the end of the world as Clair knows it – and it’s partly her fault. A brilliant science-fiction thriller, the second in the Twinmaker trilogy. This edition includes a bonus short story.

Stranded in the desert, the last of mankind is kept safe by a large border fence… Until the fence falls.

Squid is a young orphan living under the oppressive rule of his uncle in the outskirts of the Territory. Lynn is a headstrong girl with an influential father who has spent her entire life within the walled city of Alice.

When the border fence is breached, the Territory is invaded by the largest horde of undead ghouls seen in two hundred years. Squid is soon conscripted into the Diggers – the armed forces of the Territory. And after Lynn finds herself at odds with the Territory’s powerful church, she too escapes to join the Diggers.

Together Squid and Lynn form an unlikely friendship as they march to battle against the ghouls. Their journey will take them further than they ever imagined, leading them closer to discovering secrets about themselves, their world, and a conspiracy that may spell the end of the Territory as they know it.

Arrabella Candellarbra is like no one you’ve ever met before; even though her questy thing is the stuff of legend.

Arrabella, a beautiful, flaxen-haired maiden trained in all things warrior-like by The Reginas – the most famous warriors of all – embarks on a quest to claim her birthright and to wield the power of all the lands.

The Four Adventurers soon find themselves pitted against the Evil Betty-Sue – the meanest of evil beings in all of the lands – and her scary minions: the Saw-Toothed Bunnies, the Viscous Tongued Frogs and the Barella Monkeys – to rescue The Reginas from… something!

Arrabella Candellarbra and the Questy Thing to End All Questy Things, a fairy tale for grown-ups, features love and lust, action and inaction, battles, incantations, sexual shenanigans and high-kicking sing-a-longs.

And it promises that all those epic questy things will never be the same again.

Fourteen year old Byron James wishes he’d never been dragged to Parkton.

It’s a crazy sideshow of a town in the middle of damn nowhere, and he’s stranded there. To make matters worse, his two new friends – his only friends – turn out to be class rejects with an unhealthy interest in monsters. They want to discover the truth to the infamous monster house at number 809 Jacob Street.

Joey Blue is an old bluesman who fell into his songs and couldn’t find his way out again. Now he’s a Gutterbreed, one of the slinking shifting shadows haunting the town’s alleys. When an old dead friend comes begging for help, Joey’s world is torn apart. He is forced to stare down the man he has become in order to rescue the man he once was – and there is only one place he can do that.

The house on Jacob Street calls to them all, but what will they find when they open its door?

By now you all know I’m good friends with Angela Slatter. You should also know that I’m a huge fan of her work – it’s great when one of your friends is also one of your favourite writers. One of the best books I’ve read in recent years was Sourdough & Other Stories, Angela’s collection of short stories published by Tartarus Press. Not only is it a collection of brilliant stories, it’s a beautiful artifact of a book too. Tartarus make wonderful things. Well, Angela was supposed to write a sequel collection, but being the contrary writer she is, she wrote a prequel collection instead. It’s called The Bitterwood Bible and Other Recountings. Tartarus agreed to publish it and Angela scored the amazing Kathleen Jennings to do internal illustrations for it. The result is a book even more beautiful than Sourdough, and equally chock full of amazing stories. I know that, because I’ve read it. The book’s not out til September 1st, but we’re friends, remember? So I got Angela and Kathleen to talk a bit about it and the process of its creation. You can read that below. At the end is a link to the Tartarus Press website where you can pre-order the book, and I really, really recommend that you do. And if you haven’t read Sourdough, buy that too and you can read it while you wait. I’m not just talking up my friends here, either – Sourdough was nominated for the World Fantasy Award and the Aurealis Award for Best Collection. These are books you do not want to miss. Over to Angela and Kathleen.

***

Angela:

My Author’s Note to Bitterwood goes thus:

The Bitterwood Bible and Other Recountings is intended as a prequel to Sourdough and Other Stories. It was meant to be a sequel, but the tales were determined to defy me—they insisted upon telling what had happened before, to show how the books of Murcianus came to be, how Ella came into the world, where Hepsibah Ballantyne—who appears only as a name on a headstone in Sourdough’s Lodellan cemetery—began the chain of events that are traced through the mosaic of this book. Bitterwood expands and builds upon the world of Sourdough and, I hope, makes readers feel they are coming home once again.

I’d written “The Coffin-Maker’s Daughter” in 2011 as a standalone story for Steve Jones’s A Book of Horrors anthology, and that seemed the place to start. Hepsibah had gone from being a name on a grave to a powerful presence, so that story is one that threads through the whole of Bitterwood. As I wrote the stories fell into place and I can honestly say that this collection was one of those rare things that a writer dreams of: knowing exactly what was going to happen, when, and to whom. I was able to weave together so many of the things I love: elements of history and myth and fairy tale and folklore. There are little nods to writers as diverse as Umberto Eco and Kim Newman. There are vampires, boarding schools for assassins, pirates who are being hunted to extinction, a brazen head that tells the future, bakeries and rats, transformed badgers and dreadful revenges − and books. So many books.

As the narrative came together I started to think not about a cover, strangely, but about internal illustrations. I love Kathleen Jennings’ artwork and I knew she had an ambition to do endpapers, so I asked if she would like to beta read the stories as I finished them and, if perhaps the spirit moved her, do some illustrations as she read? She said yes, which was lucky for me; luckier still the lovely people at Tartarus took both the collection and agreed to use Kathleen’s illustrations. I feel very fortunate and privileged to have drawings done that truly capture the spirit of the tales I wrote. And of course there was the absolute wicked delight of having Kathleen text me photos of what she’d done as she read a story.

It was such a pleasure to work with her and I hope I was a well-behaved author! I don’t think I was critical or asked for any kangaroos to be added to The Last Supper. I’m doubly spoiled because Kathleen also did the artwork for my limited edition collection of Black-Winged Angels (Ticonderoga Publications), which echoes the silhouette technique of Arthur Rackham, but has its own wonderful unique beauty.

Kathleen:

Angela would keep dropping hints about the most beautiful parts of her stories, often before they were written – badgers (sigh) and a school for poison girls, doors in trees, dangerous quilts… so any workload-related resolve was fairly well weakened by the time she sent me the manuscript, because now they were here! They were real stories in the world, and I could read them!

I spent a lot of time in cafes, reading and sketching, sending Angela texts with reactions and pictures – each gaining energy from the other’s excitement! We’re still doing this, if you saw our comments back and forth when Tartarus released pictures of the Actual Book.

It was a lovely way to work, actually: just a free hand to sketch my way through the book. Because the original plan was to try and sell Tartarus on the idea of endpapers, I was going for multiple small images and the individual pressure was off – I could just draw anything that caught my fancy. And then Angela would edit it out of the manuscript. But anyway.

I’m still haunted by images from this book. Images and titles (‘Now all pirates are gone’). And Tartarus did a lovely job of putting the pictures in just where they ought to be – Angela and I had to check in with each other to say, “Did you see where they put the badgers? I knowwww!”

This has come up a couple of times in various conversations recently, so I thought I’d talk about it here. Ebooks are here to stay, obviously. While there will always be print books too, even if that does eventually reduce to Print-on-Demand and collector’s folio editions, ebooks will only continue to gain strength. There’s the whole format and DRM thing to still sort out – Amazon aren’t about to give up the mobi format any time soon, and a lot of places are struggling with where they stand on DRM – but these are all ongoing teething problems. I’d like to imagine a utopia where ePub is the standard across all vendors and publishers (which it already is if you don’t include Amazon) and where DRM is a thing of the past. But regardless of how it all shakes down, ebooks are mainstream now.

I love ebooks. I dig that I can carry hundreds of books around on my phone. Honestly, how living-in-the-future is that shit? And I do read on my phone. But primarily I read from an iPad Mini. I love my Mini – it’s the perfect size and does all the things I want. Plus, I have this sweet leather cover for it that makes it look like a cool old hardback book. Here it is:

Pretty sweet, huh? I use it for internet, email, videos, TV, games and loads of other stuff as well as reading. It’s just the best thing ever, technology-wise.

But I didn’t always read ebooks on the Mini and I use several apps even now. Other people I’ve spoken to use a variety of devices and all swear by them. Some people consider dedicated ereaders a cul-de-sac technology that’ll die down to almost nothing because tablets are so much more versatile, while others love their dedicated ereader precisely because it’s just for reading and has no other distracting functions.

I got onto the whole ebook bandwagon pretty early on. For example, when I originally self-published RealmShift back in the day, it was the 376th book to be uploaded to Smashwords, as evidenced by its URL there. There are now over 300,000 books on Smashwords. I would read ebooks on my PC from very early on too. I guess I knew right off the bat that this technology was going to quickly become the norm and it most certainly did. Interestingly, that massive rush into the mainstream that ebooks made was largely encouraged along by Amazon and their Kindle device. They really saw an opportunity and exploited it with expert (some might say evil) skill.

After reading on my laptop and phone for a while, my first dedicated ereader was an old generation Kindle 3, like the one pictured on the left, and I got hooked fully into the Amazon ecosystem. I was already there really, using the Kindle app – I even converted ePub files to mobi to use on the Kindle. I didn’t mind at all at the time – Amazon always had the most content, you could buy with one click and it would roll straight onto your reader. And the battery life of the Kindle is awesome. The reading experience is great too, with no backlight and all that jazz. Apparently, the new Paperwhite is even better, but I’ve yet to see one of those in the flesh… plastic… whatever. But I don’t use my Kindle any more. My wife uses it a bit and I do actually miss it in some ways, but it became superfluous to my needs.

I used the Kindle app on my phone while I used my Kindle 3 and that was awesome. If I was out and had ten minutes to spare, I could dial up whatever book I was reading and the app would automatically sync it to the last place I’d read. But I began to get more and more disillusioned with Amazon and at the same time, more or less, got my iPad Mini. The Kindle was no good for comics and I read a lot of those, so an iPad was a great choice. I got the Kindle app for it and discovered that the backlit screen really doesn’t bother me at all. So the Kindle 3 became unnecessary luggage.

Now my phone and iPad are all I carry, and they do all I need. But I’m not all about Kindle any more. There are so many reading apps out there. Rather than buy in to the Amazon ecosystem entirely, I started looking at other options. I found that a lot of publishers sell direct from their own websites, a lot of small press use places like Smashwords as well as Amazon, and I recently discovered that the Kobo store is great. All of these use ePub, and don’t tie you to Amazon. And I particularly like ePub because I discovered a couple of years ago an app called Marvin. It’s only for iDevices at the moment, but apparently an Andriod version is in the works. It’s my favourite ereader now and I’ll always look for an ePub file that I can sideload to Marvin as my first port of call when I want a new book. If I can’t find that, I’ll shop at Kobo and use the Kobo app. As a last resort, I’ll go back to Amazon and read with the Kindle. I also still use the Kindle app to read PDFs and Word documents that I send myself using my Kindle email thing. It’s really a case of what’s best for any given situation, but always looking for ePub first.

So while I almost exclusively read ebooks on the iPad Mini now (with occasional forays on my phone), I do it with a variety of apps and stores. I don’t think I’ll ever go back to a dedicated ereader. And I read about 50/50 ebook/print, so I’ll certainly never abandon paper books. I’m an utter bibliophile and love my bookshelves. I love to get beautiful editions, especially hardbacks, of my favourite books, though income doesn’t allow me to indulge that as much as I’d like. And if I read an ebook that I really enjoy, I’ll get the paper edition for my shelves. Most recently that happened with Nathan Ballingrud’s amazing debut collection of short stories called “North American Lake Monsters”. I bought the ebook, absolutely loved it and, as soon as I’d finished reading, I flipped from the reading app to the browser on my iPad and bought the last signed hardcover from the Small Beer Press website. All without leaving my couch. There’s that living-in-the-future shit again. So brilliant.

So what about you? What’s your ereader of choice? How do you shop for ebooks? Let me know in the comments and let me know too about any great apps or readers I might have missed out on.

I’ve been going on a lot lately about Bound. It’s no surprise, really. I have a book out from a major publisher and it’s on shelves in bookstores and everything! I’m still finding it hard to believe, but I’m certainly enjoying it. However, now I want to spread the love – I’ve been going on so much lately about myself, it’s time I talked about other people a bit. Below are the books and stories I’ve been really enjoying lately and I highly recommend you check them out. Let’s go:

The Hunt for Pierre Jnr By David M. Henley (the sequel, Manifestations, is out now too.) As the blurb says, “He can make you forget, he can control you and he is only eight years old. Three months after his birth he escaped. An hour later he was lost to surveillance. No one knows where he has been for the last eight years … Now Pierre Jnr is about to return.” Sounds good, right? It is.

Last Year, When We Were Young by Andrew McKiernan. I had the pleasure of MCing the launch of this excellent debut collection of short stories. It’s fantastic and Greg Chapman sums it up nicely in this review here.

Exile by Peter M Ball. Okay, I haven’t read this one yet as I’ve only just bought it, but Peter Ball’s stuff is always good and I expect this novella to be up there as well. So I’m including it here.

The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman. I mean, really, it’s enough that it’s by Gaiman, right? But this is a wonderful book and very British in style and setting. As an ex-pat Brit, that appealed to me a lot. But whether you’re British or not, it’s well worth your time.

SNAFU: An Anthology of Military Horror edited by Geoff Brown and A J Spedding. I had the honour of writing a foreword for this collection of military horror short stories. There’s fantastic variety here and it’s a tremendous collection. You’ll be surprised at the scope.

Trucksong by Andrew Macrae. A post-apocalyptic Australia with sentient trucks fighting and fucking and stuff. I know, right? It’s written in an incredibly well-developed Australian voice and is something quite different.

Galveston by Nic Pizzolatto. This is the guy who wrote True Detective, which is some of the best television I’ve seen in recent years. This is a southern crime noir kinda thing, fantasically written. I loved it.

North American Lake Monsters by Nathan Ballingrud. Possibly the best short story collection I’ve read in recent years. Again, I reviewed it for Thirteen O’Clock, so go here to read me gushing about it.

Lexicon by Max Barry. My book of the year last year and it won an Aurealis Award. A fantastic story about the power of words and language and modern magic rolled up with science and it’s a thriller and… and… Just read it.

The Shining Girls by Lauren Beukes. A superb supernatural serial killer, crime thriller thing. This book has had loads of attention and all of it well-deserved. A must read.

And next up on my list are Guardian by Jo Anderton (which will be great because it’s book three after Debris and Suited, which were great), Broken Monsters by Lauren Beukes (after the awesomeness of The Shining Girls, I can’t wait for this one) and Dreaming of Zhou Gong by Traci Harding (which I only got yesterday, signed no less, and I’m looking forward to a lot). Very exciting reading ahead, I think.

A quick web search will reveal any of these to you, so off you go and get some good stuff. Let me know what you think. And if you’ve read something simply brilliant lately, drop a mention in the comments and we can keep this sharing of good stuff going.

You guys have heard me talk about Angela Slatter plenty before. She’s a good friend of mine, but more than that, she’s one of the best writers I know. Specialising in dark fantasy and horror, she’s the author of the Aurealis Award-winning The Girl with No Hands and Other Tales, the World Fantasy Award finalist Sourdough and Other Stories, and the Aurealis finalist Midnight and Moonshine (with Lisa L. Hannett). And that’s just a fraction of her bio. She’s the first Aussie to win a British Fantasy Award too. Check out all about her publications and awards here.

Angela has a new chapbook out from Spectral Press called Hearth and Home. It’s a great read and I’ve asked her five questions about it and about horror and her writing in general. The questions are below, but before you read them, go and get the chapbook, as it’s limited edition and there aren’t many left. You can send an email to spectralpress[AT]gmail[DOT]com or maybe get one of the last ones from Angela herself by emailing me[at]angelaslatter[dot]com

You won’t be sorry. So, on with the Qs:

1. What’s “Hearth and Home” all about and why did you write this story?

Well, it’s about a woman whose teenaged son has come home after a lengthy trial. He was found innocent but things are not as they should be, life doesn’t return to ‘normal’. Basically it’s the story of Caroline’s journey through figuring out just how far from normal things are. I wrote it because Simon Marshall-Jones from Spectral Press had said ‘Sooo, hey, how about a chapbook story?’ And I’d seen the work he’d done with other authors such as Gary McMahon in the chapbook series and thought ‘Yep, get me some of that!’

2. What’s the real draw card for you with horror?

I don’t mind gore if it’s well used and cleverly placed for maximum effect, but I really, really hate explicit shock for the sake of shock. It has a numbing effect after a while and that is not the point of horror for me. Horror is about the creeping shiver that becomes a full-blooded scream … I enjoy the psychology of that journey, that’s what wraps me up in a good horror story.

3. Chapbooks are still cool. Why?

I think they’ve never really gone out of fashion in particular, i.e. genre, quarters, and they’re now riding the wave of small press resurgence. I think that’s because small presses are in a unique position to create books that aren’t your traditional trade paperback with the imperative to sell millions. That’s not to say they don’t want to make money, but there’s definitely a place for books are collectable artefacts that remains even in an age of e-books and the throwaway paperback.

I also like to think that you can see the craft in them, they don’t necessarily look like something that’s from a cookie cutter … there’s an individuality to them that feels very human and person-made.

4. If you could organise one of those haunted house murder mystery dinners, who would you invite? And who would be the killer?

Oooooh. I’m going to ask the living and the dead, the real and the imagined! Angela Carter and Tanith Lee, Tom Hiddleston and Benedict Cumberbatch, Robert Shearman and Lisa Hannett, Mark Gatiss and Christopher Lee, Helen Marshall and Helen Mirren. And Neil Gaiman, who would be the killer and whom no one would suspect coz he always seems so nice.

5. What’s next for Doctor Slatter?

Dr Slatter has three books out this year: The Bitterwood Bible and Other Recountings (from Tartarus Press), Black-Winged Angels (from Ticonderoga Publications), and The Female Factory (written with Lisa Hannett and coming out from Twelfth Planet Press). No matter what anyone tells you, I am open to working with publishers that don’t start with the letter ‘T’.

I currently have a novel called Vigil doing the rounds; I am finishing my novella for Spectral Press, which is called The Witch’s Scale; and I’m finishing up my collection The Tallow-Wife and Other Tales, which is the result of my Queensland Writers Fellowship year; I’m working on another novel called Scandalous Lady Detective, and going back to an old novel called Well of Souls to finish it off.

In between I am occasionally offering an editing and story development service, but it’s starting to feel like a bit of a time-squeeze at this point!

My story, “Shadows of the Lonely Dead”, is coming out in the Suspended in Dusk anthology (Books of the Dead Press, due mid-late 2014) and the editor, Simon Dewar, has just released the full list of contributing authors and their stories. It’s a stellar bunch:

That’s alphabetical, of course. The final order of stories and a cover reveal are apparently coming soon. I think this is going to be a great book. A few of those stories are reprints, but the majority are original, and all follow the theme of “suspended in dusk” to some degree. Should be well worth a read. And can I just point out that I’m going to be in a book with Ramsey Campbell. Achievement Unlocked!

Issue 14 of SQ Mag is out. It’s the Australiana Special Edition and includes loads of great stuff like new stories from Kaaron Warren and Sean Williams, lots of other top stories and features, and my novelette, The Darkness in Clara.

I’m really proud of this story and I hope other people like it too. I was honoured to learn that it inspired the cover for this issue.

The best thing about SQ Mag, apart from the stellar content obviously, is that it’s all free to read online. Here’s the opening to my story:

The Darkness in Clara
by Alan Baxter

Michelle saw Clara’s feet first, absurdly suspended a meter above the ground, toes pointing to the carpet, ghostly pale and twisting in a lazy spiral. The rest of the scene burst into her mind in one electric shock a fraction of a second later; Clara’s wiry nakedness, limp arms, head tilted chaotically to one side. Her tattoos seemed faded against ashen skin. Her so familiar face grotesque and wrong, tongue swelling from her mouth like an escaping slug. And her bulging eyes, staring glassy and cold as Michelle began to scream. Light from the bedside lamp cast Clara’s shadow across the wall like a puppet play, glinted off the metal legs of the upturned chair beneath.

I bought her that belt, Michelle thought, as she stared at the worn black leather biting deep into the blue-tinged flesh of Clara’s neck, and she drew breath to scream again.

I got a wonderful surprise on Saturday when a few messages started coming in saying something along the lines of, “Congratulations on your Ditmar nomination!” I hadn’t realised the Award shortlist had been released, but it only took a moment to see social media alive with the news (at least, spec fic related social media in Australia.) It turns out that my story, Not the Worst of Sins, published in issue 133 of Beneath Ceaseless Skies magazine, has been noninated in the Best Short Story category. Thanks so much to everyone who voted for that, it’s a real honour. The Ditmars are an Australian national award decided by popular vote. Anyone active in the SF scene and fandom can nominate works, then anyone who was at the previous year’s NatCon (National SF Convention) or has a full or supporting membership for this year’s NatCon can vote for the winners.

This year, the NatCon is Continuum X in Melbourne in June. The awards ceremony will be held there. If you went to Conflux in Canberra last year, or you’re going to Continuum this year, you can vote in the Ditmars. I really recommend that you do vote, as the more people who get involved, the more the winners will reflect the opinion of the wider community. If you’re not going to the cons, but you want to vote, you can buy a supporting membership for Continuum X for just $35, which gives you several benefits including voting rights. And you can vote online in a matter of minutes. Couldn’t be easier! Voting is open now until one minute before midnight AEST (ie. 11.59pm, GMT+10), Wednesday, 28th of May, 2014.

I’ll post the full list of nominated works in all categories below, but here are a few relevant links:

So please do get involved. My own inclusion notwithstanding, I honestly think this is one of the strongest Ditmar Award ballots for years, in every category. You could do worse than getting hold of everything on this list (and anything on the Aurealis Awards list from last month) and you’d be set up with some fantastic reading of Aussie spec fic.The AAs and now the Ditmars are showing very clearly that Australian spec fic is stronger than ever.

So, get your membership and get voting (or if you went to Conflux last year, just get voting!) and if you’re going to NatCon this year in June, I’ll see you there!

Saturday was a big day. I drove down to Canberra, took part in the Conflux Writer’s Day minicon, where I did a highspeed “Social Media for Authors” presentation, then went for a quick change of clothes in order to attend the Aurealis Awards ceremony. Nicole Murphy, who organised everything that day, did a truly amazing job. The writers day and awards ceremony were both superb. We caroused and drank and laughed, and fantastic Australian fiction scored very well-deserved awards.

Here are all the fantastic nominees and winners. If you want a sampler of excellent recent Aussie spec fic, here’s your huckleberry:

The following sounds like a description of an airplane, like something you might hear from somebody like Bert Rutan:

when we addressed the wing, we started with a complicated rule, to limit what a designer could do. We added more and more pieces as we thought of more and more outcomes, and we came to a point where it was so complicated—and it was still going to be hard to control, because the more rules you write the more loopholes you create – that we reverted to a simple principle. Limit the area very accurately, and make it a game of efficiency.

But it's not from Rutan at all; it's an excerpt from Wings, the Next Generation, an article discussing the sailboats to be used in next summer's America's Cup qualification matches.

Now, everybody knows that sails, and airplane wings, actually have very much in common, so it really isn't surprising that this sounds like aerospace design. However, as Paul Cayard notes in the article, the wings on a competition sailboat have a few special constraints:

the America’s Cup rules don’t allow stored power, so two of our eleven guys—we think, two—will be grinding a primary winch all the race long. Not to trim, but to maintain pressure in the hydraulic tank so that any time someone wants to open a hydraulic valve to trim the wing, there will be pressure to make that happen.

It will be fascinating to see these boats in person, racing on the bay, but I'm glad I won't have to be one of those grinders!

Over the long weekend, a number of people seem to have picked up and commented on Mikeal Rogers's essay about Apache and its adoption of the source code control tool, Git. For example, Chris Aniszczyk pointed to the essay, and followed it up with some statistics and elaboration. Aniszczyk, in turn, points to a third essay (a year old), by Josh Berkus, describing the PostgresQL community's migration to git, and a fourth web page describing the Eclipse community's migration to git. (Note: Both Eclipse and PostgresQL migrated from CVS to git).

I find the essays by Rogers and Aniszczyk quite puzzling, full of much heat and emotion, and I'm not sure what to take from them.

Rogers seems to start out on a solid footing:

For a moment, let's put the git part of GitHub on the back burner and talk about the hub.

On GitHub the language is not code, as it is often characterized, it is contribution. GitHub presents a person to person communication system for contributions. Documentation, issues, and of course code, travel between personal repositories.

The communication medium is the contribution itself. Its value, its merit, its intention, all laid naked for the world to see. There is no hierarchy or politic embedded in the system. The creator of a project has a clear first mover advantage but the possibility is always there for its position to be supplanted by a fork, creating a social imperative to manage contributions in a satisfactory manor [sic] to her community.

This is all well-written and clear, I think. But I don't understand how this is a critique of Apache. In my seven years of experience with the Derby project at Apache, this is exactly how an Apache software project works:

Issues are raised in the Apache issue-tracking system;

discussion is held in the issue comments and on mailing lists;

various contributors suggest ideas;

someone ""with an itch to scratch"" dives into the problem and constructs a patch;

the patch is proposed by attaching it to the issue-tracking system;

further discussion and testing occurs, now shaped by the concrete nature of the proposed patch;

a committer who becomes persuaded of the desirability of the patch commits it to the repository;

eventually a release occurs and the change becomes widely distributed.

This is the process as I have seen it and participated in it, since back in 2004, and, I believe, was how it was done for years before that.

So what, precisely, is it that Apache is failing at?

Here is where Rogers's essay seems to head into the wilderness, starting with this pronouncement:

Many of the social principles I described above are higher order manifestations of the design principles of git itself.

[ ... ]

The problem here is less about git and more about the chasm between Apache and the new culture of open source. There is a growing community of young new open source developers that Apache continues to distance itself from and as the ASF plants itself firmly in this position the growing community drifts farther away.

I don't understand this at all. What, precisely, is it that Apache is doing to distance itself from these developers, and what does this have to do with git?

Rogers offers as evidence this email thread (use the ""next message by thread"" links to read the thread), but from what I can tell, it seems like a very friendly, open, and productive discussion about the mechanics of using git to manage projects at Apache, with several commenters welcoming newcomers into the community and encouraging them to get involved.

This seems like the Apache way working successfully, from what I can tell.

Aniszczyk's follow-on essay, unfortunately, doesn't shed much additional light. He states that ""what has been happening recently regarding the move to a distributed version control system is either pure politicking [sic] or negligence in my opinion.""

So, again, what is it that he is specifically concerned about? Here, again, the essay appears to head into the wilderness. ""Let's try to have some fun with statistics,"" says Aniszczyk, and he presents a series of charts and graphs showing that:

git is very popular

lots of job sites, such as LinkedIn, are advertising for developers who know git

There is no 3.

At this point, Aniszczyk says ""I knew it was time to stop digging for statistics.""

But again, I am confused about what he finds upsetting. The core message of his essay appears to be:

The first is simple and deals with my day job of facilitating open source efforts at Twitter. If you’re going to open source a new project, the fact that you simply have to use SVN at Apache is a huge detterent [sic] from even going that route.

[ ... ]

All I’m saying is that it took a lot of work to start the transition and the eclipse community hasn’t even fully completed it yet. Just ask the PostgreSQL community how quick it was moving to Git. The key point here is that you have to start the transition soon as it’s going to take awhile for you to implement the move (especially since Apache hosts a lot of projects).

Once again, I'm lost. Why, exactly, is it a huge deterrent to use svn? And why, exactly, does Apache need to convert its existing projects from svn to git? Just because LinkedIn is advertising more jobs that use git as a keyword? That doesn't seem like a valid reason, to me.

Note that, as I mentioned at the start of this article, the PostgresQL team migrated from CVS to git, not from Subversion to git. I can completely understand this. The last time I used CVS was in 2001, 10 full years ago; even at that time, CVS had some severe technical shortcomings and there was sufficient benefit to switching that it was worth the effort. So I'm not at all surprised by the PostgresQL community's decision. The article by Berkus, by the way, is definitely worth reading, full of wisdom about platform coverage, tool and infrastructure support, workflow design, etc.

So, to summarize (as I understand it):

PostgresQL and Eclipse are migrating from CVS to git, successfully (although it is taking a significant amount of time and resources)

Apache is working to integrate git into its policies and infrastructure, but still uses Subversion as its primary scm system

Some people seem to feel like Apache is making the wrong decision about this

But what I don't understand, at the end of it all, is in what way this is opposed to ""the Apache way?"" From everything I can see, the Apache way is alive and well in these discussions.

UPDATE:Thomas Koch, in the comments, provides a number of substantial, concrete examples in which git's powerful functionality can be very helpful. The most important one that Thomas provides, I think, is this:

It is much easier to make a proper integration between review systems, Jenkins and Jira, if the patch remains in the VCS as a branch instead of leaving it.

I completely agree. Working with patch files in isolation is substantially worse than making reference to a branched change that is under SCM control. Certainly in my work with Derby I have seen many a contributor make minor technical errors while manipulating a patch file, that on the whole just adds friction to the overall process. Good point, Thomas!

But there is very little else. George Trimble's homepage no longer exists, and most of the links from the existing summary pages at Wikipedia and elsewhere point to articles in the IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, which (like Bloom's original paper at the ACM site) is protected behind a paywall and can't be read by commoners.

Computer Usage Company is credited with being ""the world's first computer software company"", but it seems on the verge of disappearing into dust. It's a shame; you'd think the software industry would work harder to keep information about these early pioneers alive.

I wonder if the IEEE keeps any statistics regarding how many people have actually paid the $30 to purchase this 20-year-old, five page memoir? I would have been intrigued to read it; I might even have paid, say, $0.99 or something like that to get it on my Kindle. But thirty dollars?

It's amazing to me that Stanford are, at this point, clinging to hopes for a BCS at-large bid. Should it really be this hard to get two Pac-12 teams into the BCS? I guess that the SEC are still hoping they will field 3 teams in the 10 team BCS schedule...

The interviewer, who goes by the handle ""moshboy"", describes the intent of the project here:

all I wanted to do was get some words of insight out of a few independent videogame developers that weren’t known to put many of their own words ‘out there’. In the beginning, the idea was to interview those that had rarely or never been interviewed before.

Both reconciliation and deduplication can be abstracted as the problem of efficiently computing the set difference between two sets stored at two nodes across a communication link. The set difference is the set of keys that are in one set but not the other. In reconciliation, the difference is used to compute the set union; in deduplication, it is used to compute the intersection. Efficiency is measured primarily by the bandwidth used (important when the two nodes are connected by a wide-area or mobile link), the latency in round-trip delays, and the computation used at the two hosts. We are particularly interested in optimizing the case when the set difference is small (e.g., the two nodes have almost the same set of routing updates to reconcile, or the two nodes have a large amount of duplicate data blocks) and when there is no prior communication or context between the two nodes.

The paper itself is well-written and clear, and certainly worth your time. It's been particularly rewarding for me because it's taken me down a path of investigating a lot of new algorithms that I hadn't previously been studying. My head is swimming with

Invertible Bloom Filters (a variation on counting Bloom filters, which in turn are a variation on basic Bloom filters, an algorithm that is now 40 years old!)

Tornado codes

Min-wise sketches

Characteristic Polynomial Interpolation

Approximate Reconciliation Trees

and many other related topics.

I hope to return to discussing a number of these sub-topics in later posts, whenever I find the time (heh heh). One of the things that's challenging about a lot of this work is that it's based on probabilistic algorithms, which take some time getting used to. I first studied these sorts of algorithms as an undergraduate in the early 1980's, but they still throw me when I encounter them. When studying probabilistic algorithms, you often encounter sections like the following (from the current paper):

The corollary implies that in order to decode an IBF that uses 4 independent hash functions with high probability, then one needs an overhead of k + 1 = 5. In other words, one has to use 5d cells, where d is the set difference. Our experiments later, however, show that an overhead that is somewhat less than 2 suffices.

The question always arises: what happens to the algorithm in those cases where the probabilities fail, and the algorithm gives the wrong answer (a false positive, say)? I believe, that, in general, you can often structure the overall computation so that in these cases the algorithm still gives the correct answer, but does more work. For example, in the deduplication scenario, you could perhaps structure things so that the set difference code (which is trying to compute the blocks that are identical in both datasets, so that they can be eliminated from one set as redundant and stored only in the other set) fails gracefully on a false positive. Here, a false positive would need to cause the overall algorithm to conclude that two blocks which are in fact distinct, but which collide in the data structure and hence appear to be identical, are treated as distinct and retained in both datasets.

That is, the algorithm could be designed so that it errs on the side of safety when the probabilities cause a false positive to be returned.

Alternatively, some probabilistic algorithms instead fail entirely with very low probability, but fail in such as way as to allow the higher-level code to either simply re-try the computation (if it involves random behaviors, then with high probability it will work the next time), or to vary the computation in some crucial aspect, to ensure that it will succeed (which is the case in this particular implementation).

Most treatments of probabilistic algorithms describe these details, but I still find it important to always keep them in my head, in order to satisfy myself that such a probabilistic algorithm is safe to deploy in practice.

Often, the issue in using probabilistic algorithms is to figure out how to set the parameters so that the behavior of the algorithm performs well. In this particular case, the issue involves estimating the size of the set difference:

To efficiently size our IBF, the Strata Estimator provides an estimate for d. If the Strata Estimator over-estimates, the subsequent IBF will be unnecessarily large and waste bandwidth. However if the Strata Estimator under-estimates, then the subsequent IBF may not decode and cost an expensive transmission of a larger IBF. To prevent this, the values returned by the estimator should be scaled up so that under-estimation rarely occurs.

That is, in this particular usage of the probabilistic algorithms, the data structure itself (the Invertible Bloom Filter) is powerful enough that the code can detect when it fails to be decoded. Using a larger IBF solves that problem, but we don't want to use a wastefully-large IBF, so the main effort of the paper involves techniques to compute the smallest IBF that is needed for a particular pair of sets to be diff'd.

If you're interested in studying these sorts of algorithms, the paper is well-written and straightforward to follow, and contains an excellent reference section with plenty of information on the underlying work on which it is based.

I mostly avoid political topics on my blog, but the current events on the University of California campuses are very important and need more attention. Here is a superb essay by Professor Bob Ostertag of U.C. Davis about the events of the last week, and a follow-up essay discussing ongoing events.

Meanwhile, it's interesting that some of the most compelling and insightful commentary is being published outside the U.S., for example this column and this column in the Guardian.

I don't know what the answers are. But I do know that the debate is important, and I salute the Davis and Berkeley communities for not backing down from the questions, and for opening their minds to the need to hold that debate, now. Our universities, and our children, are our future.

Both articles are extremely interesting, well-written, and deeply and carefully considered. Here's an excerpt from the WSJ discussion:

The strategies that people use to assert privacy in social media are diverse and complex, but the most notable approach involves limiting access to meaning while making content publicly accessible. I’m in awe of the countless teens I’ve met who use song lyrics, pronouns, and community references to encode meaning into publicly accessible content. If you don’t know who the Lions are or don’t know what happened Friday night or don’t know why a reference to Rihanna’s latest hit might be funny, you can’t interpret the meaning of the message. This is privacy in action.

And here's an excerpt from the First Monday article:

Furthermore, many parents reported that they helped their children create their accounts. Among the 84 percent of parents who were aware when their child first created the account, 64 percent helped create the account. Among those who knew that their child joined below the age of 13 — even if the child is now older than 13 — over two–thirds (68 percent) indicated that they helped their child create the account. Of those with children who are currently under 13 and on Facebook, an even greater percentage of parents were aware at the time of account creation. In other words, the vast majority of parents whose children signed up underage were involved in the process and would have been notified that the minimum age was 13 during the account creation process.

And there are actually many reasons why I would want to allow her to do that. First and foremost, this is the opportunity for me to monitor her interactions on Facebook — requiring she be a friend at least for a few years. That allows me some access and the ability to educate. Second, all of her friends were on Facebook. This is where tween interactions occur. Finally, I actually think that it is the evolving means of communication between people. To cut off a child from that seems like cutting them off from the future.

I can entirely sympathise; my wife and I had similar deep discussions about these questions with our children (although at the time it was MySpace and AOL, not Facebook ).

They are your kids; you know them best. In so many ways, Facebook is just another part of life that you can help them with, like all those other temptations of life (drugs, sex, etc.). Talk to them, tell them honestly and openly what the issues are, and why it matters. Keep an eye on what they are doing, and let them know you'll always be there for them.

There are no simple answers, but it's great that people like boyd and Gans are pressing the debate, raising awareness, and making us all think about what we want our modern online world to be like. Here's boyd again:

We must also switch the conversation from being about one of data collection to being one about data usage. This involves drawing on the language of abuse, violence, and victimization to think about what happens when people’s willingness to share is twisted to do them harm. Just as we have models for differentiating sex between consenting partners and rape, so too must we construct models that that separate usage that’s empowering and that which strips people of their freedoms and opportunities.

This isn't going to be easy, but it's hard to think about anything that is more important that the way in which people talk with each other.

So don't just ""get over it"". Think about it, research it, talk about it, and help ensure that the future turns out the way it should.

This morning, the O'Reilly web site is running a condensed interview with Jonathan Stark, discussing, with the benefit of several months of hindsight, the intriguing ""Jonathan's Card"" events of the summer.

If you didn't pay much attention to Jonathan's Card as it was unfolding in real time, this is a good short introduction, with a summary of the events and some links to follow-up material.

If you have any interest at all in the software industry, you'll be absolutely fascinated to read this detailed article at the GrokLaw website about the legal dispute between Microsoft and Barnes & Noble over Android-related patents.

The Microsoft-created features protected by the patents infringed by the Nook and Nook Color tablet are core to the user experience.

and

Our agreements ensure respect and reasonable compensation for Microsoft's inventions and patent portfolio. Equally important, they enable licensees to make use of our patented innovations on a long-term and stable basis.

However, what has never been known (until now), is precisely what those patented innovations are. As Mary-Jo Foley observed more than 6 months ago, Microsoft refuses to identify the patents, and why it believes Android infringes upon them, unless a Non Disclosure Agreement is signed agreeing not to reveal that information.

Barnes & Noble apparently refused to sign that agreement, and instead found counsel to represent them, and now the information about the patents in question is no longer a secret.

According to the Barnes & Noble filings, the primary Microsoft patent which Android infringes is a 16-year-old patent (U.S. Patent 5,778,372), which patents:

A method of remotely browsing an electronic document residing at a remote site on a computer network and specifying a background image which is to be displayed with the electronic document superimposed thereon comprising in response to a user's request to browse to the electronic document.

Apparently, changing the background on your screen when a document is displayed is patented.

I understand software quite well.

I don't understand law at all, and specifically I don't understand intellectual property law.

However, I find the GrokLaw analysis of the Barnes & Noble v. Microsoft dispute absolutely fascinating.

These Internet-scale datacenters have really taken off in recent years. Last month the Open Compute community held their second Open Compute Summit, and part of that effort was the establishment of a foundation to guide the work as it moves forward; read more about that effort here. I haven't seen too much technical information flowing from the Open Compute Summit, although James Hamilton of Amazon posted his slides online here: here

Meanwhile (was this part of the summit, or independent?), the team at AnandTech have done some independent testing of the Open Compute server components; in their conclusion, they commend the Open Compute work as showing tremendous potential:

The Facebook Open Compute servers have made quite an impression on us. Remember, this is Facebook's first attempt to build a cloud server! This server uses very little power when running at low load (see our idle numbers) and offers slightly better performance while consuming less energy than one of the best general purpose servers on the market. The power supply power factor is also top notch, resulting in even more savings (e.g. power factoring correction) in the data center.

While it's possible to look at the Open Compute servers as a ""Cloud only"" solution, we imagine anyone with quite a few load-balanced web servers will be interested in the hardware. So far only Cloud / hyperscale data center oriented players like Rackspace have picked up the Open Compute idea, but a lot of other people could benefit from buying these kind of ""keep it simple"" servers in smaller quantities.

Lastly, since much of the activity in this area of computing has to do with power efficiency, let me draw your attention to this interesting work on power management in Android.

Cheaper, faster, and more power-efficient: the future of computing beckons!

This month, the IEEE's Spectrum magazine publishes its special report, Fukushima and the Future of Nuclear Power. It's an immense and detailed report, with multiple articles, multi-media presentations, and lots of material to dig through.

A good place to start is the lead article, 24 Hours at Fukushima. This article summarizes the events of the critical first 24 hours after the earthquake, with a focus on specific events and actions that seem like they represent learning opportunities.

The article has all sorts of fascinating details about the events of that day, such as the fact that it was hard to bring emergency equipment to the site when the roads were full of evacuations headed from the side; the observation that, after the earthquake but prior to the tsunami, an emergency cooling system was intentionally shut down because it was cooling the reactor too fast; the detail that, once power went out, electric security locks on building doors and fences had to be first broken before emergency equipment could be moved through them; and the observation that, when reactor 1 exploded, debris from the explosion ripped through the emergency backup power cable that had been installed to bring emergency power back to the plant.

And much, much more. There are so many small breakdowns, and decisions, and implications, that can be considered and thought about and studied.

The article notes that many of the subsequent problems arose from the fact that backup electrical power was lost, and could not be restored, and suggests several lessons that should be learned, including various ways to ensure that backup electrical power would be less likely to be lost, more likely to be subsequently restored, and perhaps even less likely to be needed; specifically, the article calls out 6 ""lessons"":

LESSON 1: Emergency generators should be installed at high elevations or in watertight chambers.

LESSON 2: If a cooling system is intended to operate without power, make sure all of its parts can be manipulated without power.

LESSON 5: Ensure that catalytic hydrogen recombiners (power-free devices that turn dangerous hydrogen gas back into steam) are positioned at the tops of reactor buildings where gas would most likely collect.

Not all of these lessons seem self-evidently obvious to me; for example, it seems like the recommendation to store backup power trucks ""very close to the power plant site"" would simply have resulted in leaving those trucks vulnerable to the same event that took out the main building power systems. As we know, the 14-meter tsunami washed away much larger and more resilient structures than backup power trucks.

Still, the lessons seem well-meant and clearly point out starting points for the discussions to come about improvements and enhancements. I love lesson 2 in particular, as it points out one of those ""obvious in hindsight"" mistakes that clearly represents an opportunity for all operators in every such site to review their similar equipment and ensure that it doesn't suffer from the same design flaw.

Engineering is hard. Things happen that you didn't expect, and you have to study your mistakes, learn from them, explore alternatives, test systems, and revise, revise, revise. As the article notes, we've learned a great deal from the tragedy at Fukushima, and we need to continue to learn more.

I'm not a nuclear engineer, but I am immensely grateful for efforts such as this one, to help us interested lay-people try to come to grips with what happened, and why, and what does it mean, and how do we make it better in the future.

Certainly, it makes me more motivated to return to my own designs, and to study them, and test them, and continue to learn from my own failures and make my future work better. I recommend this article highly; I think you'll find it interesting and well worth your time.

This is the second major release since I joined the team, and I'm quite excited about it. Although I played only a minor role in this release, I had a chance to get involved in many of the new features, and there are some really powerful enhancements in this release.

Engineers love releases (really, we do!): the whole point of writing software is to build something that gets used, and in order for it to get used, it has to get released. So even though a release is a whole lot of work, the result is that a new version of the product becomes available, and gets used, and that's always exciting!

This is the sort of book that takes you about 2 solid hours to read, if you try hard. And I'm not exactly sure why you would try hard, because it isn't really a book that rewards that. It is a very transparent book: it sets a simple goal, and it achieves it, completely:

If you've ever wondered, while browsing the web, ""Why is this weird thing popular? Who cares about this stuff? How does this thing have so many views? Why do people waste their time with this? Where did it come from and where is it all going?"" then read on.

Stryker's book succeeds: it helps you understand the concept of Internet memes; it shines a little light into the odd, strange corners of the Internet; it gives you some context for approaching some of the aspects of Internet life that probably seemed, if not downright horrifying, at least hard to comprehend:

What are memes?

Why is anonymity such a big deal on the Internet?

What are griefers, trolls, noobs?

If you've never heard of Anonymous, 4chan, lolcats, Rule 34, Star Wars Boy, or Encyclopedia Dramatica, then you should probably just pass this book by; its subject matter is of no interest.

But if you've heard of those topics, yet been slightly intimidated, and slightly unsure of how to proceed, then you might find this book helpful: it de-mystifies much of those lesser-known areas of the Internet, sets them out in plain terms and simple descriptions, and gives you at least enough knowledge to decide for yourself whether you want to know more.

As I reflected on the book, and tried to understand what I had learned, and how to summarize it, I found myself drawn to a particular passage. Stryker is describing an old (1986) computer game called Habitat, which was an early investigation of human-versus-human gaming:

One contentious game play element in Habitat was ""Player vs. Player"" or ""PvP"" killing. Experienced players were able to handily murder noobs, which made the game less fun for everyone but those who'd been there the longest. In addition, the very concept of virtual murder was controversial. It didn't take long for trolls to start randomly killing other players as they wandered around the virtual town. But if the engineers were to disallow PvP killing entirely, they would rob players of the thrill of danger and the joys of conquest. The moderators held a pool, asking if killing should be allowed in Habitat. The results were split 50/50. So they compromised. Killing would be disallowed inside the carefully manicured urban areas, but the moment you left town and headed out into the frontier, you were announcing to other players that you were down to scrap, if need be. This clever solution pleased most players, and continues to be the standard for many massively multiplayer games.

So will the Internet continue to look. Those who value safety over freedom will hang out on Facebook and other proprietary communities and mobile apps walled off with identity authentication. And those willing to brave the jungles of the open Internet will continue to spend time in anonymous IRC channels and message boards like 4chan.

It's an interesting metaphor, and I think it's insightful. In a new world, it's important to have a discussion about rules. And to have that discussion, there has to be a certain amount of discussion about where (and when) the rules apply. As Stryker notes:

/b/ is significant because it's the only board on 4chan that has no rules (the only thing prohibited is committing or plotting actual crimes, the same rules that apply to any public forum on or offline).

Actually, as it turns out, there are more rules than these, but to a certain extent in order to understand the rules, you have to be a member of the community.

The Internet is still young, and we are still learning how we want to behave in this new cyberspace. Places like 4chan, although almost certainly not your cup of tea, are still worth understanding and thinking about, and Stryker's book is a step toward opening the discussion and having those debates.

This is great news, and really emphasizes not just the excellence that is currently manifest in the top levels of chess, but also its growing spread, as the top list includes players from several countries not previously known for chess prowess (Carlsen is from Norway, Anand from India, and Wang Hao from China is in the top twenty as well).

But McClain goes on to claim:

But ratings inflation — caused in part by looser rules guiding them — makes it difficult to compare different eras.

The ratings system was actually never intended for such comparisons. It was created in 1960 by Arpad Elo, a physics professor, as a snapshot of each player’s ability and a tool for predicting games’ outcomes. The system has been tweaked over the years, but it has held up well.

McClain provides no evidence for this claim, which is a shame, as from what little I know, the evidence in fact shows entirely the opposite. As I described in a short blog post last summer, a fairly detailed study by students at the University of Buffalo recently concluded that

there has been little or no ‘inﬂation’ in ratings over time—if anything there has been deﬂation. This runs counter to conventional wisdom, but is predicted by population models on which rating systems have been based

Regardless of whether or not the ratings are being inflated, there is no doubt in my mind that today's chess players are playing some wonderful chess. As we look toward next year's World Chess Championship, there is lots of reason to be excited about the world of chess!

Gibson, of course, is one of the greatest science fiction writers ever, the man who coined the term ""cyberspace"", who gave us (so far) nine spectacular novels, with hopefully more coming.

What will you learn if you go read the interview? Well, all sorts of things!

You'll learn about Gibson's fascinating writing techniques: never planning past the first sentence, constantly re-working and re-considering his story:

Every day, when I sit down with the manuscript, I start at page one and go through the whole thing, revising freely.

...

I think revision is hugely underrated. It is very seldom recognized as a place where the higher creativity can live, or where it can manifest. I think it was Yeats who said that literary revision was the only place in life where a man could truly improve himself.

letting the work flow from someplace hard to describe:

I’ve never had any direct fictional input, that I know of, from dreams, but when I’m working optimally I’m in the equivalent of an ongoing lucid dream. That gives me my story, but it also leaves me devoid of much theoretical or philosophical rationale for why the story winds up as it does on the page. The sort of narratives I don’t trust, as a reader, smell of homework.

You'll learn about Gibson's view on whether science fiction writers are writing about the future, the past, or the present:

Nobody can know the real future. And novels set in imaginary futures are necessarily about the moment in which they are written. As soon as a work is complete, it will begin to acquire a patina of anachronism. I know that from the moment I add the final period, the text is moving steadily forward into the real future.

...

all fiction is speculative, and all history, too—endlessly subject to revision.

You'll learn what Gibson, surprisingly, finds to be the technology that is most characteristic of the human species:

Cities look to me to be our most characteristic technology. We didn’t really get interesting as a species until we became able to do cities—that’s when it all got really diverse, because you can’t do cities without a substrate of other technologies. There’s a mathematics to it—a city can’t get over a certain size unless you can grow, gather, and store a certain amount of food in the vicinity. Then you can’t get any bigger unless you understand how to do sewage. If you don’t have efficient sewage technology the city gets to a certain size and everybody gets cholera.

You'll get some great anecdotes that will totally drop your jaw:

For years, I’d found myself telling interviewers and readers that I believed it was possible to write a novel set in the present that would have an effect very similar to the effect of novels I had set in imaginary futures. I think I said it so many times, and probably with such a pissy tone of exasperation, that I finally decided I had to call myself on it.

A friend knew a woman who was having old-fashioned electroshock therapy for depression. He’d pick her up at the clinic after the session and drive her not home but to a fish market. He’d lead her to the ice tables where the day’s catch was spread out, and he’d just stand there with her, and she’d look at the ice tables for a really long time with a blank, searching expression. Finally, she’d turn to him and say, “Wow, they’re fish, aren’t they!” After electro­shock, she had this experience of unutterable, indescribable wonderment at seeing these things completely removed from all context of memory, and gradually her brain would come back together and say, Damn, they’re fish. That’s kind of what I do.

It's a thrilling roller-coaster of an interview, with so many choice bits that you'll find yourself returning to his ideas again and again.

I think that most of this blogging activity has been inspired by Ben Horowitz, who is by far the most active and best blogger of the bunch.

But the other blogs are quite interesting too, and there are some additional interesting materials on the site. If you're interested in the software industry, and more specifically in the VC-funded software startup industry, there is a lot of interesting material to see here, including blogs from:

I know from my own experience how much time and effort it takes to write a blog. I'm pleased that this group, who have lots of experience and knowledge, are investing the energy into sharing their thoughts and opinions; hopefully it will inspire others to do the same, and in the meantime it means more interesting essays to read!

Legacy software, so goes the old saying, is any software that actually works.

Of course, there is a fair nugget of truth to this aphorism, for once a system is running we start to be increasingly unwilling to change it.

Yet software is soft for a reason; it can be changed, and it can be improved.

It's always interesting to watch this process at work, for the improving of software can be a messy business, not just for technical reasons, but also because of social, cultural, and business reasons.

A major event recently was Google's decision to take a new direction with their proposed new Dart language. As Weiqi Gao observes, this has grown into quite the discussion, with some backers wanting to continue to improve JavaScript, while others feel that it's time to embark on designing a new language (such as Dart). Major discussion has ensued, and some of the emotions have been rather heated:

I respect the people involved and believe they’re for the most part making their own choices. But Dart and other unrelated Google agenda items do impose clear and significant opportunity costs on Google’s standards actiivities.

""Unrelated""? I think that is an overly strong critique. Surely Dart is strongly related.

What is the best way, then? Continue to improve the existing language, or work on building new languages? Can we really not do both? After all, Dart is not the only new language built on top of and closely related to JavaScript: consider CoffeeScript, for example. It is another new language which is designed for the web, and is implemented by being compiled into JavaScript. CoffeeScript is interesting; it pushes the envelope in other directions, such as borrowing the ""whitespace is structure"" paradigm from Python (a technique I've always found fascinating, even if I can barely manage to maintain decent indentation standards in my own code).

I think such experimentation with new languages is wonderful, which is why it's so great to see techniques such as Source Maps, which allow tools like IDEs and Debuggers that were written for one language to be used, in a semi-interpreted style, with other newer languages built atop those old languages. Clever!

So, just as Weiqi Gao does, I applaud the invention of these new languages, and I hope the experimentation continues. And I applaud the improvement of compilers and VMs and language runtimes, to enable such language experimentation and innovation. Even though I continue to earn my living coding in Dennis Ritchie's good old C language, all these new ideas and new approaches help us all think about problems in new ways, and find better techniques to solve problems.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Containment of Yosemite fire now 23% as blaze climbs record books

Firefighters capitalized on a blanket of moist air that settled over the mountains near Yosemite National Park on Tuesday night to increase containment of the Rim fire to 23%.

The blaze – now entering its 12th day – has burned 187,466 acres and is on pace to soon become the sixth-largest fire in state history. Containment was up from 20% Tuesday.

Advertisement

Overnight, firefighters continued to build and strengthen containment lines and conduct backfiring operations to slow the blaze as it rages farther into Yosemite National Park.

Authorities also ordered evacuations for residents in the fire's path south of California 120 and north of Old Yosemite Road.

The U.S. Forest Service said Tuesday that ground crews planned to work through the night to build containment lines on the northern flank of the fire. Communities north of the blaze, along the Highway 108 corridor from Tuolumne City to Pinecrest, also remained under evacuation orders.

Officials said crews on the southeast flank in Yosemite were planning to conduct extensive backfires, a dangerous tactic in which firefighters burn vegetation inside a fire line to help contain a rapidly spreading blaze.

Nearly 4,100 firefighters are taking part in the effort.

The blaze has destroyed 111 buildings, including 31 homes, and was the seventh-largest fire in California history. The fire was spewing out huge clouds of smoke that drifted into Nevada. The blaze had spread across 281 square miles.

The Rim fire, said California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman Daniel Berlant, was ""burning its way into the record books.""

A number of structures were lost in the Tuolumne Berkeley Family Camp, which includes three commercial properties and 85 tent cabins and outbuildings, the Forest Service said.

While firefighters have used the Tuolumne River and granite formations on the fire's northern edges to set up defenses, crews have found little to work with on the blaze's eastern front south of the Hetch Hetchy reservoir.

""They're in scouting mode,"" Dick Fleishman of the U.S. Forest Service said of fire crews. ""There's not a lot of real good areas to get out in there and do a lot of work.""

The Stanislaus National Forest is taking the brunt of the blaze, with the Groveland Ranger District making up most of the southern flank. The region has been hit hard by fires in the past, the most significant in 1987, which claimed the life of a firefighter.

This week's fire has brought sorrow among the district's employees, who not only recall the past devastation but also begrudge the current damage. The fire burned though an area that had a pending $1-million timber sale, said Maggie Dowd, district ranger in the Groveland Ranger District.

""The economic impacts are real, but we haven't begun to estimate them yet,"" Dowd said Tuesday from her office in a building shrouded in smoke.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

“The Tea Party: a Movement Running Out of Steam!”

by jim_worthPosted: Friday, 3/12/2010

What started out as a ‘Grass Roots’ movement is low on steam.

By definition grass roots is: ‘ordinary people regarded as the main body of an organization’s membership. Therefore, the ‘main body’ of the Tea Party is a collection of ordinary people with a common interest.

So what is the common interest of the members of this Tea Party: government spending, or taxation, or a return to the Constitution, or seeing President Obama’s birth certificate, or maybe the elevation of Sarah Palin?

Which ever it is, it is clearly evident that even the members of this ‘grass roots’ movement aren’t sure which it is.

From the moment of the first demonstrations, Tax Day, Wednesday, April 15th, it was evident that the movement was destined to struggle!

People screaming of “no more taxation” when there hasn’t been any new taxes in more than 6 years. Some were adamant about government spending which was creating a deficit that was untenable, despite the fact that the Bush administration had more than doubled government debt in his 8 years in office.

But, any party that has Sarah Palin at the heart of it’s national agenda or platform is in serious trouble. Sarah referred to the Tea Party Movement as the ‘future’ of politics. But, contrary to what the Tea Partiers believe, there is no future for any group as fragmented as this movement is.

The Tea Partiers do have one thing right. This country is ripe for revolution. But their anger is misplaced and they’re attacking the wrong target.

As I stated in an article entitled “The MadHatter’s Tea Party,” written and submitted to the Los Angeles Times on Tax Day last year, the movement has no clear direction. Nor is it a ‘grass roots’ movement when it’s organized and supported by right wing lobby organizations and Fox Views.

Those who are pushing the Tea Party movement have become more ‘grass roots’ in their attempt to affect change. Several different factions have sprouted up in an attempt to keep their varied agendas moving forward.

In order to be ‘truly’ grass roots the Tea Party needs to shed organizations like Freedomworks, Human Events, and Fox. They must avoid the talking points these self-absorbed organizations use to manipulate the message and adopt platforms and an agenda of their own.

The newest agenda of some Tea Party organizations is to promote candidates for many elected positions on the local, state, and national level. Their intent, to replace incumbent elected officials, is admirable. There is a growing nationwide desire to clean up government by removing corporate bought partisan congressional representatives and replacing them with individuals who will work ‘for the people.’ The Tea Party thinks they have the solution!

A few of the small Tea Party leaders visualize their ideals as the seeds of a third National Party. But to many outside observers they appear to be the Libertarian Party without the clear focus.

There are some pretty smart people who have joined the movement, who have some good ideas, and a ‘real’ desire for positive change. They could help the Tea Party movement survive if their ideas and plans are embraced by the members. The big question—will their voices be heard above the din? Or will the crazies drown out the voices of the sane?

The recent Tea Party Convention was an attempt to bring Tea Party factions together. But it only served to further fracture the fragile movement. Despite attempts by the organizers to declare the event a success, the low attendance and late withdrawals of featured attendees was evidence of the struggles the embattled movement faces.

Convention organizers, Judson and Sherry Philips, founders of Tea Party Nation, had high hopes for the first National Tea Party Convention, but the event ran into early troubles over fees and payments to speakers.

The low attendance, estimated at about 600, the exodus of Representative’s Marsha Blackburn and Michelle Bachman, and the disjointed speech by ex-congressman Tom Tancredo were all signs of fractures within the movement.

As the keynote speaker they chose Sarah Palin, whom, reportedly, was paid over $100 thousand for her appearance. Those deeply committed to the movement are enamored by Palin who feigns the suggestion that she is their potential leader. Her bubbly, charismatic presence clearly energizes the Tea Party base, but her star is fading outside the movement as more people realize she has little substance in her convictions.

Her speech to around 1,000 people at the convention was a series of the same tired talking points. Rarely does she advance any issue with facts. Even her charisma will not get her beyond mere talking points.

And as Palin’s leader role runs out of steam, so, too, does the Tea Party movement. Unless someone rises with a clearer platform Tea Partier’s will begin to lose interest. And if things improve in the economy and unemployment, the passion for revolt will die.

Regardless of whether they survive or not, the Tea Party movement has proved one thing. It proves there is a strong and pervasive level of unrest throughout the nation. A stirring nation that has tired of politicians who no longer represent the interests of ‘the people’; career politicians who treat their constituents with utter disdain, no longer listening to their needs.

Unless the factions of the Tea Party coalesce their ideas, narrow their scope and message, find some dynamic leaders with vision, it will lose steam. But even in failure the movement will have left an indelible mark on the political landscape.

"ABOUT US

The doctrinal standards of the Methodist Church of the Bahamas are as follows:

The Methodist Church of the Bahamas claims and cherishes its place in the Church universal, which is the Body of Christ. It rejoices in the inheritance of the apostolic faith and loyally accepts the fundamental principles of the historic creeds and of the Protestant Reformation.It ever remembers that in the providence of God Methodism was raised up by God to spread scriptural holiness throughout the land by the proclamation of the evangelical faith and declares its unfaltering resolve to be true to its divinely appointed mission.The doctrines of the evangelical faith which Methodism has held from the beginning and still holds are based upon the divine revelation recorded in the Holy Scriptures. The Methodist Church of the Bahamas acknowledges this revelation as the supreme rule of faith and practice. These evangelical doctrines to which the preachers of the Methodist Church of the Bahamas both ministers and lay persons are pledged are contained in Wesley's Notes on the New Testament and the first four volumes of his sermons.Wesley's ""Notes on the New Testament"" and ""The 44 Sermons"" are not intended to impose a system of formal or speculative theology on Methodist preachers, but to set up standards of preaching and belief which should secure loyalty to the fundamental truths of the gospel of redemption and ensure the continued witness of the Church to the realities of the Christian experience of salvation. Christ's ministers in the Church are stewards in the household of God and shepherds of His flock. Some are called and ordained to this sole occupation and have a principal and directing part in these great duties but they hold no ministry differing in kind from that which is common to all the Lord's people and they have no exclusive title to the preaching of the gospel or the care of souls. These ministries are shared with them by others to whom also the Spirit divides gifts severally as the Spirit wills. It is the universal conviction of the Methodist people that the office of Christian ministry depends upon the call of God who bestows the gifts of the Spirit the grace and the fruit which indicates those whom He has chosen.Those whom the Methodist Church of the Bahamas recognizes as called of God and therefore receives into its ministry shall be ordained by the imposition of hands as expressive of the Church's recognition of the minister's personal call.The Methodist Church of the Bahamas holds the doctrine of the ministry of all Christians and consequently believes that no ministry exists which belongs exclusively to a particular order or group of persons but in the exercise of its corporate life and worship special qualifications for the discharge of special duties are required and thus the principle of representative selection is recognized.The Methodist Church of the Bahamas recognizes two sacraments namely Baptism and the Lord's Supper as of divine appointment and of perpetual obligation of which it is the privilege and duty of members of the Methodist Church of the Bahamas to avail themselves.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

dr.young I wrote to you asking abpot my vl and tcells a month ago.thank you fore your response.I was asking you why my tcells have increased so much over the past 3 years from 240 to 1350 and my vl went from 704,000 to 200. you mentioned that the concern is that such a low viral load might lead to some resistance.I did forget to mention that in the past 3 years my cd4's have always increased but there where a few times that my vl increased also.one of my tests revealed that my vl went frome like 900 to like 2500 i dont remember the excact numbers.at that time i told my doctor i wanted a resistance test wich came back that i wasnt resistant to my meds.my next test my vl was back down again.also my latest labs where my vl went from 170 to 800 and my cd4's went from 1350 to 1170.a couple points to note: 1 I did my blood work a 7am and ii herd thet your cd4's are lower in the morning then afternoon,2 it seems to me when i do my labs after haveing been sick with the flue or a cold my numbers seem to be worse and 3 these latest labs that i gave you i did in nov of 2004 after being ill for awhile.( cold i think )and at 7am,I am retesting in feb just to see whats going on if infact these increases in vl and decreases in cd4's infact where do to being ill.so my question is what do you think about being ill affecting your numbers and about the fluctuation in vl over the years with my test saying i had no resistance?

Response from Dr. Young

Hello again, 3 years,

You're correct on all points-- there is a lot of variability to the viral load test, and illness (even something as insignificant as a cold) or immunizations can cause small increases in the measurement. The later nearly always occurs in the abscence of resistance. Such could be the case when your viral load is higher.

I certainly recommend that patients defer getting their viral load and CD4 cell counts during periods of such illness; wait a couple of weeks before getting the tests done.

That said, it's rather unlikely that you're always sick when your lab tests are done-- I still am puzzled about cases like yours, but rest assured that there are others like you.

"What do we wish most for our children? Next to being healthy, we want them to be happy, of course. Fortunately, a wide array of scientific studies show that happiness is a learned behavior, a muscle we can help our children build and maintain.

Drawing on what psychology, sociology, and neuroscience have proven about confidence, gratefulness, and optimism, and using her own chaotic and often hilarious real-world adventures as a mom to demonstrate dos and don’ts in action, Christine Carter, PhD, executive director of UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, boils the process down to ten simple happiness-inducing steps.

With great wit, wisdom, and compassion, Carter covers the day-to-day pressure points of parenting—how best to discipline, get kids to school and activities on time, and get dinner on the table—as well as the more elusive issues of helping children build healthy friendships and develop emotional intelligence. In these ten key steps, she helps you interact confidently and consistently with your kids to foster the skills, habits, and mindsets that will set the stage for positive emotions now and into their adolescence and beyond. You will discover

the best way avoid raising a brat—changing bad habits into good ones;

tips on how to change your kids’ attitude into gratitude;

the trap of trying to be perfect—and how to stay clear of its pitfalls;

the right way to praise kids—and why too much of the wrong kind can be just as bad as not enough;

New Move To open Hunting In Zambia

(posted December 17, 2001)

In a move that appears to signal a reopening of hunting next year,
the Zambia National Tender Board today officially asked safari operators
to submit bids for the control of the country's hunting concessions.
The deadline for submitting bids is January 4. ""I'm definitely
taking this to mean hunting will reopen next year,"" Mike Faddy
told The Hunting Report this morning. Faddy is head of the Zambia
Professional Hunters Association, and he has his finger on the pulse
of hunting developments.

The other good news on hunting in Zambia is, a Director General
of Zambia Wildlife Authority (ZAWA) has finally been named. We hope
to have more information on the new director as early as tomorrow.
Suffice it to say, the new director is getting rave reviews so far.
The call for tenders is directly related to his being named, according
to sources we spoke with this morning.

ZAWA, you'll recall, is the new quasi-private organization that
was slated to take over all wildlife-related matters in Zambia more
than a year ago, which is when the old National Parks Department
was disbanded. Since then, Zambia has been without any kind of game
department at all. The European Union during this period has had
millions of dollars ready to help ZAWA get rolling, but has refused
to release the funds until a director general and support staff
are in place. Presumably those funds will now be released. If so,
Zambia's wildlife programs could be on their way to a complete recovery
shortly.

To be sure, there are some open questions still. The most important
revolves around the possible impact of the presidential election,
which is slated for December 27. Will the current tender process
be acceptable to whoever wins the election? Or will still another
tender process be initiated by the winner? No one we spoke with
had any idea how to answer those questions. In fact, no one we have
spoken with for months has been willing to predict just who will
win the election. It's no secret that the closure of hunting in
Zambia was linked to presidential politics. Surely, its reopening
will be too.

The other open question at this point is the condition of Zambia's
game. With no game department in place for more than a year, and
with concessions empty of personnel for an entire summer, poaching
has been widespread.

Doubts and questions aside, the underlying news here is good. A
definitive move has been made toward the reopening of hunting in
Zambia. We're hoping for the best, and we are keeping our fingers
crossed. More details soon. - Don Causey.

"Border problem: A pipeline of children

Jul. 15, 2014

A teenage boy looks out the window of his sleeping area on June 19, 2014, at the Instituto Nacional del Migracion, a municipal shelter in Reynosa, Mexico, for child migrants that is receiving growing numbers of children caught by Mexican authorities and will be deported to their countries of origin. / David Wallace, David Wallace/The Republic

According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, more than 47,000 unaccompanied children have crossed the border into the U.S. in the past fiscal year, a number that could double in the coming months. The vast majority of these kids are coming from the troubled Central American countries of Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.

The Arizona Republic has a team of journalists reporting from Central America and the McAllen, Texas-Mexico border working on a project that will attempt to fill in this pipeline from the impoverished neighborhoods these kids are leaving, to the Mexican-Guatemala border, then the rugged journey to the Rio Grande and the raft ride across the river, where they are almost immediately picked up by the Border Patrol.

Reporter Bob Ortega and photographer Michael Chow are reporting from Central America, based in San Salvador and Guatemala.

Reporter Daniel Gonzalez and photographer David Wallace are reporting from the Rio Grande Valley, both sides of the border, based in McAllen, Texas.

Upcoming stories:

Finding shelter. Many of the kids stop in shelters before they cross into the U.S. We will paint a picture with photos and words of the scene there. Do they know where their parents are? What do they expect in America?

"Schools' actual budget becomes clearer

A final accounting shows that cuts made in December were important.

For the past year, the most important question facing the Hernando County school system has been about the health of the district's budget.

It was a year during which the district had three budget directors: one who said the sky was falling, another who said there were no worries and a third who tried to sort out the truth.

It was a year in which then-superintendent John Sanders and the School Board at times didn't know whom to believe or where things stood. Eventually, they sought a middle road, agreeing in December to cut their budget back by $2.4-million.

Now, a final accounting of the books shows that the December cuts were much-needed but that a financial meltdown feared by some never materialized. In short:

The district spent $85.5-million last year on day-to-day expenses, about $100,000 less than the revenue it took in.

Before the cuts, the board was on pace to spend about $2-million more than it took in.

The cuts not only brought the budget in line but also added $143,000 to the district's slim rainy day reserve, which now stands at $1.3-million.

Medical costs in the school district's self-funded health insurance plan outstripped the money put into the plan by $2.9-million, creating an internal debt that must be repaid with cash that could otherwise be spent on the classroom.

The new numbers bring clarity to a budget that was anything but clear in the past year.

The fog developed when budget director Vince Benedict, who resigned last summer for health reasons, and Sara Perez, his successor, came to vastly different conclusions about the district's financial state.

Benedict, a veteran who relied on his experience and his insight as much as raw data, predicted that 2000-2001 would be a tight year. But, with some routine adjustments, he predicted that his final budget would prove accurate.

Perez, who put her faith in hard numbers instead of gut feelings, said Benedict's original budget was on pace to spend $5.9-million above its expected revenues.

Carol MacLeod, a former auditor who took over the budget office in December after Perez resigned for family reasons, was asked to sort out the truth.

By then, the board had cut its budget, enacted a hiring freeze and put strict limits on new spending. The cuts weren't devastating. But they were far more drastic than Benedict's past practice of covering shortfalls in one area of the budget with surpluses from other parts.

Jo Ann Hartge, who was president of the Hernando Classroom Teachers Association last year, said cuts meant the district wouldn't pay for substitute teacher's aides when regulars were out sick, leaving teachers to fly solo in crowded classrooms.

They meant that a handful of teachers working outside the classroom, including two that taught rookie teachers survival skills and helped struggling veterans improve, had to fill teaching vacancies. Their previous jobs were simply eliminated.

For a time, Hartge said, it also meant that supplies ranging from workbook materials to art supplies were hard to get and professional training was reduced. Toward the end of the year, things eased up some. But, Hartge said, ""I don't want to repeat that again.""

MacLeod has refused to declare a winner in the Perez-Benedict debate. But she has some thoughts on the problems in the budget.

Benedict, who was on chemotherapy for bladder and prostate cancer at the time, didn't leave any clear documentation of what early adjustments Perez needed to make to the budget.

At the same time, MacLeod said people overreacted to Perez's worst-case prediction that the budget was $5.9-million out of line. Even Perez knew that routine retirements and resignations would result in less-than-expected payroll spending, she said.

In the end, MacLeod said the school district was never in a budget ""crisis."" Budgets are spending plans, she said, and they are not etched in stone. By definition, they require constant tweaking. But she agrees that a $2.4-million cut is nothing to laugh at.

""I would have hoped we would have done our front-end work better so we wouldn't have needed to do that,"" MacLeod said. ""But there is nothing wrong with that.""

The school district faces two financial audits in the next few months that are mandated by the state. And MacLeod plans to give a clearer view of where the December cuts were made.

Both should shed further light on the budget.

For now, the district has an $86.8-million budget, slightly larger than last year's. But schools have been ordered to cut back on spending money they have discretion over -- one final safeguard to keep history from repeating itself.

"This is a hybrid collective/class action FLSA/Pennsylvania state minimum wage law case arising from work in the gas fields of our region. The Court has previously written on matters related to this case, including substantial recitations of the underlying facts, so they will not be repeated here.

By prior Order, the Court authorized the mailing of notice of FLSA opt-in procedures to certain current and former employees of the Defendant related to certain of its Pennsylvania operations, and its facility in Decatur, Texas. The opt-in period will soon expire, and the Court directed the parties to meet and confer and to then submit a proposed case management order relating to further pretrial activities, including discovery. Counsel has met to do that, and while many matters relative to such an Order have been agreed upon, not all were, so the Court convened an extensive status conference with counsel in an effort to resolve those open issues. Some were, and some were not, and after consideration of the positions and proposals of each party, the Court will enter the Third Amended Case Management Order (""Order"") of this date.

The Court provides this Opinion in order to explain its rulings on some of the disputed matters, and to set out its further expectations of counsel.

Counsel for the Plaintiffs has urged the Court to permit somewhat more limited discovery followed by comparatively prompt summary judgment practice as to the application (or not) of the ""Motor Carrier Exemption"" to the FLSA in this case, contending that doing it that way would protect the material interests of the parties, would foster fruitful settlement discussions, and would minimize anticipated costs. Counsel for the Defendants, on the other hand, says that unless and until discovery as to a significant portion of the actual/potential claimants occurs, his clients cannot fairly and accurately assess the likelihood or magnitude of liability, [1] something necessary both to defend the case and to be in any position to meaningfully think about (let alone discuss) potential settlement. Defendants also point out that for quite some time now, the Plaintiffs have propounded, and the Defendants have responded to, lots of ""paper"" discovery (100 interrogatories and requests for production of documents). Without saying so directly, the Defendants seem to contend that just as they are getting into the discovery they think that they need to both size up and fully litigate or settle the case, the Plaintiffs are urging that discovery now be truncated, when doing so would be inappropriate and would materially prejudice them.[2]

Given the current status of this case, the discovery and proceedings to date, the procedural posture of the proceedings, the complexity of the factual and legal issues resolved and to be resolved, and what the Plaintiffs say may well be the amount in controversy, the Court concludes that the Defendants have somewhat the better of the argument, and that further discovery as authorized by the Order is appropriate to permit the parties to prepare and advance their claims and defenses, which will also facilitate meaningful ADR proceedings.

The currently open issues seem to come in several categories: pretty significant (location of depositions), somewhat important (the number of certain discovery requests and dates for amendments to pleadings), rather unusual (what to do if deponents just don't show up as noticed?), and essentially meaningless (must reply briefs to summary judgment motions coming months from now be filed, if at all, in 14 or 20 days?).

As to the identity and location of depositions, the Court will direct that counsel meet and confer (a teleconference or video conference is OK), and come up with a ""master list"" of all anticipated deponents for both sides. Once that is done, counsel should endeavor to group them by day/series of days to cut down on travel costs for all concerned, and also to determine whether they can be handled by video, [3] and if not, where is the most logical, fair, economical place for those depositions.

As to ""in-person"" depositions, if they are to occur, they should be done where they are most logical, convenient and cost-effective. While the Defendant is correct in the broader sense that plaintiffs should ordinarily be deposed in the judicial district where an action is pending, that is not necessarily the case here. The nature of the business and operations involved here presumed that crews will move around. While those persons that opt-in as Plaintiffs in a FLSA case are just that, ""party plaintiffs"" (to use the verbiage of 29 U.S.C. § 216(b)), if they are no longer present here, and there is no reasonable anticipation that they will be returning here in the near future, and it is reasonable to depose them along with other deponents in a single location elsewhere, that may be the ""just, speedy, and inexpensive"" thing to do.[4] By the same token, such persons are, by statute, ""party plaintiffs"", so they have some responsibility to participate in the lawsuit that they have joined. The long and short of it is that counsel should apply logic and reason to resolving such locational matters, and any thorny issue as to such matters as to which reasonable minds could differ can be resolved by the Court.

As to the number of ""paper"" discovery requests, the Court has considered the proposals of each side, and the Order issued this date strikes what is in the Court's judgment the appropriate balance of interests given the nature and context of the case.

The parties have attempted to address the circumstance of a deponent failing to appear for a noticed deposition. As the Court observed at a recent status conference, just not showing up at a deposition is a new concept for the Court, and one not countenanced by the Civil Rules. The Order issued by the Court provides what appears to be a mechanism for the parties to confirm the dates/time/attendance of depositions and deponents that is structured to avoid the incurring of unnecessary costs and preparation. In these regards, the Court would also note that it expects any party or witness of a party in this litigation to show up when and where they are supposed to be, absent extenuating, unavoidable/unexpected circumstances. That is one of the responsibilities of being a party in a federal lawsuit, and it will be enforced here.

As to the ""date"" for the filing of any motions for leave to file amended pleadings, the Court believes that prevailing Circuit law requires that it give rather wide latitude for the filing of such motions. Of course, any such motion may well be met with vigorous opposition if the proposed amendment causes real prejudice to the substantial rights of a party, would result in the avoidable duplication or delay in the disposition of the case, complication or repetition of discovery, or other issues that the law recognizes are properly considered in the grant or denial (or limitation) of any amendment effort. Should such a motion be filed, any opposing party will be given plenty of time to respond, and the Court will then rule on the merits of such motion to amend.

Finally, the Court has in the Order resolved the minor, rather meaningless differences in timelines for the filing of briefs that would be due months from now.

The Court finds and concludes that the Third Amended Case Management Order Dated this date complies with the applicable provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, does not prejudice the material interests of the parties, is consistent with the nature and context of this civil action, and furthers the just, speedy and inexpensive disposition of this action.

"Last Thursday at Comic-Con, Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Pan’s Labyrinth) announced that he will co-write and produce–and may also direct–a movie based on Disney’s Haunted Mansion attraction. He also took pains to emphasize that it will have no relationship to that hideous Eddie Murphy thing.* And thank gawd for that.

It’s apparently going to be family-oriented but “scary.” Walt Disney Studios also unveiled a new piece of artwork for the movie (seen above, with a larger version at the Disney blog), which looks promising.

I’m assuming the story will be based on the whole “phantom bride” thing that’s hinted at in Disneyland’s version of the ride and fleshed out more fully in EuroDisney’s Phantom Manor. Given del Toro’s fantastical imagery in his other movies, this could really be pretty cool.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Everyone knows there are gays and lesbians in everybodys family. And no office would be complete without a sassy gay character. And just about every other kid in high school is wresting with his sexuality. I know. I watch TV.

Except it isnt true, and the Centers for Disease Control just proved it. A new comprehensive study by the CDC with over 33,000 participants has confirmed earlier estimates; less than 3 percent of the U.S. population self-identifies as gay, lesbian or bisexual. Earlier, much smaller-scale surveys have put that number at 4 percent.

The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), published July 15 by the CDC, was the first large-scale study of its kind. Data was collected from the Census Bureau, as The Washington Post reported, and 33,557 adults between the ages of 18 and 64 participated in the study, which included in-person interviews as well as follow-up phone questions.

The NHIS study found that, while 96.6 percent of adults identified as straight, 1.6 percent identified as gay or lesbian, and 0.7 percent called themselves bisexual. 1.1 percent responded I dont know or said they were something else not listed.

That sure doesnt sound like society according to Hollywood, or the news media, which have young Americans convinced 30 percent of the population is gay.

Maybe thats because gay characters pop up in just about every product out of Hollywood. Men dress as women, give lap dances to other men and even get married in national awards shows likethe Grammys and Tony Awards. Media festivals likeSouth by Southwest and Sundance celebrate gay sex and all other kinds of relationships as completely normal. TV shows like Modern Family, The New Normal and The Fosters attempt to show that gay families are just as common and normal as any other family.

The news media does their part too. CNN has a particularly cozy relationship with GLAAD, the gay speech police. CNNs Paul Begala claimed in 2011, One out of 10 Americans is gay...At Least 10 percent of us are gay or lesbian. The media attacks businesses and churches as being out of step with reality, and calls for childrens organizations like the Boy Scouts to include gay scout leaders.

Meanwhile the media highlights stories of transgender toddlers and invokes pity for the handful of gay students who go to Christian colleges and are open about their sexuality, then complain when they are asked to abide by the schools religious rules.

Gay activists who say hateful things get a pass from the media too. Take Dan Savage, who has said all kinds of vile comments towards conservatives, Christians, and women, yet the media ignores his hate. The moment a Christian refers to the Bible on homosexuality, the media relentlessly attacks the person, their family, and tries to take away their livelihood. They did that with Phil Robertson of Duck Dynasty and Chic-Fil-As Dan Cathy.

A much higher percentage of the population believes marriage should be between man and a woman. The annual March for Marriage is the largest march of its kind yet themedia refuse to report on it each year.

I'm really getting tired of being reminded that about 3% of men like to ---- other men everywhere I turn. All the time, everywhere. Can't watch TV, can't see a movie, can't go to the store, can't go to work, can't watch a damn cartoon even!

""Have a nice day 'cause about 3% of men like to ---- other men!"" ""Would you like a free appetizer? We're having a special because about 3% of men like to ---- other men."" ""The all new 2015 POS Sedan! Because about 3% of men like to ---- other men!"" ""On the next ""All My Widgets"" Steve and Kim discuss how about 3% of men like to ---- other men."" ""And now the news. Our top story again tonight- Approximately 3% of men still like to ---- other men."" At work- ""This month is '3% of Men Like to ---- Other Men' Month.""

It's really getting aggravating. Seriously. It is now literally impossible for me to go 24hrs and not be reminded by something or someone that anal sex between dudes is a 'thing.' And I bet gay advocates think that is just peachy.

The word “gay” is misunderstood. It is a self-identifier. It is possible that the number of men that have or have had sex with another man is 10% and the number of “gay” people are still 2%. So really, it is all about how the question is asked. Young, “heterosexual” women have been having sex with each other at high rates for about 20 years. Now, young heterosexual men are doing it and that is of particular concern given the public health fallout.

Well, it would be fair to say that whatever the answer is, politics is not it.

I say that the answer is faith, which is something that goes beyond “religion” and even transcends it. I used to think people were quibbling who made a distinction between faith and religion, but now I know from experience it isn’t a quibble. Religion is all outward. It doesn’t guarantee that there is anything in the heart behind it. Faith is inward... in fact it results when you actually believe that God loves you. Religion could be a response to a conviction that either God does not care or is chiefly bent on hating you.

I don’t call them “gay”. That is a bastardazation of the word. Similar to the rainbow flag. I call them queers. And so do a lot of FReepers. The word gay and the rainbow has been usurped by the homos and is now engrained with the connection of that life style. The same way the swastija became synonomis with the Nazi party. It’s inseperable. I prefer to call them what they really call themselves, queers. And as for their use of the term gay marriage, THAT is a huge misnomer. Whatever it is, it IS NOT a true marriage.

Not a single major leaguer identifies himself as gay, but Bean is desperately needed to ""help create educational initiatives against sexism, homophobia and prejudice, presenting at annual events like the winter meetings and rookie career development program.""

It’s less than 1%. And that 1% has changed what the definition of marriage was since the beginning of recorded history. None of this degenerate, immoral garbage would would have happened if not for the election of the homosexual in the White House, wiht an assist from the spineless, worthless republicans cowering down to him like a dog in heat.

Following the independence of Bangladesh in 1971, Manabendra Narayan Larma founded the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS) on February 15, 1972, seeking to build an organization representing all the tribal peoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Larma was elected to the BangladeshJatiya Sangsad, the national legislature of Bangladesh as a candidate of the PCJSS in 1973.[4] When Larma's continued efforts to make the government recognize the rights of the tribal peoples through political discussions had failed,[5] Larma and the PCJSS began organizing the Shanti Bahini (Peace Corps), an armed force operating in the Hill Tracts area. It was formed in 1972 and fought for many years against the government.[6]

Members of Shanti Bahini in Khagrachari on 5 May 1994.

Shanti Bahini began attacking Bangladesh Army convoys in 1977.[7] They carried out kidnappings and extortion.[8][9][10] Larma subsequently went into hiding from government security forces.[8][10] Factionalism within the PCJS weakened Larma's standing and he was assassinated on November 10, 1983.[8][10] On 23 June 1981 the Shanti Bahini attacked a camp of Bangladesh rifles, killing 13 people. They later captured and executed 24 members of the Bangladesh rifles.[11] In the 1980s the Government of Bangladesh started to provide land for thousands of landless Bengali . Many Bengali were forced to move to secure regions because of the insurgency, abandoning their land to the tribal communities.[12] On 29 April 1986, Shanti Bahini massacred 19 Bengali.[13][14] On 26 June 1989 the Shanti Bahini burned down villages where inhabitants had voted in Bangladeshi elections.[15] In 1996 Shanti Bahini abducted and killed 30 Bengali.[16] On 9 September 1996, the Shanti Bahini massacred a group of Bengali woodcutters, who were under the impression they'd been called to a meeting.[17] Members of Shanti Bahini extorted some four million dollars from the local population in the name of toll collection.[18]

The Shanti Bahini abandoned militancy when the Bangladesh Awami League negotiated the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord between the government and the PCJSS on 2 December 1997.[19] Members of Shanti Bahini surrendered their weapons in a stadium in Khagrachari. The treaty saw the lifting of nighttime curfew and the return of 50 thousand refugees.[20] However, some members opposed to the peace deal formed a dissident group.[21] Some of those who opposed the peace treaty formed the United People's Democratic Front as an alternate to the PCJSS.[22] The treaty was also criticised by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party[23] and has not been fully implemented.[24] Some members of Shanti Bahini became police officers after the peace treaty. On November 2012, two of those members of Bangladesh police were arrested for stealing ammunition from the police.[25] On August 2014 Indian security forces arrested members of Shanti Bahini, two Bangladeshi and three Indian nationals, with weapons in Mizoram.[26]

The spokesman for the Shanti Bahini, Bimal Chakma alleged Indian involvement by stating that after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the removal of Bangladesh Awami League from power in 1975, [27] India provided support and shelter to the members of Shanti Bahini.[28][29][30] Members of Shanti Bahini were trained in Chakrata, India.[31][32]",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Clinton, McCain emerge as comeback winners in New Hampshire primary

WASHINGTON - Democrat Hillary Clinton pulled off an unexpected narrow victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday, dramatically rescuing her bid for the White House in a tense battle with Barack Obama.
Clinton, who's fighting to become the first woman in the Oval Office, mounted a surprisingly strong showing after bracing for a second defeat following her devastating third-place showing in Iowa.

Republican John McCain also nabbed a major comeback victory, putting him solidly back in his party's nomination race.
While Obama, vying to make history as the first black U.S. president, scored big among independents and voters between 18 and 24, Clinton attracted lower-income voters and seniors and did best among voters citing the economy as their top concern.
But a big factor for Clinton was women voters, who had gone over to Obama in large numbers in Iowa. Nearly half in New Hampshire were once again supporting her, while Obama got only a third.

You can come to Germany and see how we treat our people better with paying about the same tax rate as in some states in the USA. You all saying it is going to get bad, no matter who won or lost, the United States needs to be United.

""A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largess out of the public treasury. After that, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits with the result the democracy collapses because of the loose fiscal policy ensuing, always to be followed by a dictatorship, then a monarchy."" Make no mistake; this was a vote for more handouts by the permanently dependent. Until they finish burying the Constitution, which Obama will do as fast as he can, it's still the best country in the world.

After that, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits with the result the democracy collapses because of the loose fiscal policy ensuing, always to be followed by a dictatorship, then a monarchy."" Make no mistake; this was a vote for more handouts by the permanently dependent. Until they finish burying the Constitution, which Obama will do as fast as he can, it's still the best country in the world.

You guy make it sound like the end of the USA. It just needs politicians to meet in the middle, on all sides of the issues. I also think if the republicans would leave religion out of politics, then they would have a good chance in 2016.

I personally believe that we are well on our way, look closely at Greece; I believe that could well be us in four years.

We have a president who touts getting Bin Laden and then hangs four of our own out to dry in Libya and the media by in large gives him a pass because the mere insinuation of impropriety on the administrations part is ""offensive"" to the President. Well, sometimes the truth hurts, and here's the truth as I understand it: The consulate was denied the security forces required to protect it despite numerous requests. In spite of using the term ""terror"" in his address to the nation in the White House rose garden Obama and his surrogates spent nearly the next two weeks blaming a spontaneous ""protest"", which never happened, that had gotten out of control over some ridiculous You Tube video. As far as I'm concerned the president can be offended all he wants to but it doesn't change the facts in the matter.

Lastly, unless everyone thinks we'll be just fine going 20+ trillion dollars in debt and maintaining trillion dollar deficits over the course of the next four years, selling more and more debt to China and devaluation our own currency by simply printing more money, then we are headed for ruins IMO.

The House Speaker and the rest of the Republicans want to keep their jobs so they'll cower in the corner with their tails tucked between their legs to protect what’s left of their genitals allowing the President to run roughshod all over them being unfettered and unchecked now that he doesn't have to worry about re-election. Obama now has more ""flexibility"" to lighten up on the Iran sanctions for Putin making the world a more dangerous place. I'm not real optimistic about our country's future.

That attack in Libya was not the first attack that killed Americans at an Embassy. It happened many times before and it will happen again no matter who is President. It is sad and it sucks but if these groups, terrorist or not, want to attack us, they will.

I just see how we are too far to either the left side or the right side. If we do not get back to the middle, then we will end up like Greece. The USA does not have a ""Germany"" to bail them out so I truly believe in being fiscal conservative. At the same time though we have to pay for the things that are and have been on the books before Obama became President, the other 10t debt.

No, I do not want more debt so we should cut the social programs and put in check and controls making sure only those who really need it get it. Still though, we have to pay and I rather see the Bush tax cuts for those making more than 250k to go back up that 3%. I just do not believe the budget can be balanced just on reducing the social programs alone.

Like I said, if we do not get to the middle, then the future of the USA will not be a good one.

Agreed, but that doesn't excuse ignoring and denying the need for additional security even after several requests for it.

I agree that the approach needs to be increased tax revenue combined with spending cuts. However, this can be done by doing away with loopholes rather than raising the tax rate which has a way of ""tickling down"" to those of us making under that 250k.

...And that first ten trillion you make mention of was racked up by all the other Presidents in US history combined. The last 6+ trillion is new debt racked up by Obama in just the last four years.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Allergan Files “Free-Speech” Complaint Against Govt

The latest in the conflict between Constitutionally granted free speech and the government’s prohibition of off-label drug discussions by pharma.

Last week, Allergan, maker of Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA), announced a suit against the US government, seeking “declaratory relief” from such long-time federally mandated off-label speech restrictions.* The complaint, filed in US District Court for the District of Columbia, specifically applies to the sharing of information about Botox Therapeutic (not Botox Cosmetic) and recent requirements of the FDA’s Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) program. In its complaint, the company is represented by Paul Clement, former Solicitor General and a current partner in the DC law firm of King & Spalding.

Allergan’s suit was filed with respect to the FDA’s REMS program for botulinum toxin products. The program was instituted this year because of postmarketing reports of toxin spread after injections for off-label conditions—namely, spasticity in children with cerebral palsy and arm spasticity in adults. In the program, the FDA requires manufacturers to create a “communication plan” that provides information to physicians about the risk of the distant spread of botulinum toxin after local injection.

But Allergan argues that the FDA’s required communication plan puts the company in a double bind—effectively mandating proactive discussions about the safety of off-label Botox Therapeutic, while simultaneously prohibiting proactive off-label discussions. Allergan claims that it cannot reasonably abide by the FDA’s REMS program for Botox Therapeutic (ie, “proactively provide comprehensive information to physicians about these off-label uses [emphasis added]”) without fear of prosecution. The company writes, “Allergan seeks a judgment that would permit it to provide currently available and truthful information to doctors for common off-label uses of [Botox].”

In a conference call on Friday, Allergan’s General Counsel, Douglas Ingram, provided additional information about the complaint and fielded questions. Ingram stressed that the company’s suit applies to the provision of “truthful,” “nonmisleading,” and “comprehensive” information about the off-label uses of Botox Therapeutic. Ingram would not comment on a recent investigation of the company by the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia, which issued a subpoena in March to the California-based firm regarding the alleged off-label promotion of Botox for headache. Both Ingram and Allergan CEO, David Pyott, stressed that the company’s current complaint does not relate to alleged past activities. Ingram also declined to comment on Pfizer’s recent record-breaking $2.3-billion settlement with the government concerning off-label drug promotion.

* Mandated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. The FDCA dictates that an approved drug is “misbranded,” if it is marketed (in interstate commerce) for an unapproved use. The act stipulates that the product’s approved label, in this case, does not provide “adequate directions for use.”

"The Benefits of App-Based Mobile Research

Mobile Research: The Next Chapter

Research has certainly come a long way. From in-person interviews, to mailers, to phone centers; researchers have always been quick to harness new technologies. Yes, we still get the occasional phone survey, but research has largely relocated to the internet.

In the past, joining an online survey panel became a great way to make a few extra bucks and researchers gained direct access to respondents. But, these traditional panels aren’t without issues–

They tend to have a shallow reach, and it is difficult to fill them with a truly representative sample.

Their panelist can be “professional” survey takers, who know they are taking part in research.

Clever respondents can game the system, and commit fraud which hurts the value of your data.

To avoid these issues, many researchers are turning to mobile research. Mobile is the next chapter; and what better way to reach people than with the apps they use everyday?

Mobile research conducted with app-recruited respondents has many benefits. Here are just a few:

Broad Reach

Research done through mobile apps has been proven to reach a broad and diverse set of respondents. Everyone is plugged in. PEW research found that more than 95% of adults in the US have a cellphone, and the majority of those are smartphones.

Adults are also spending more and more time on those devices. People are spending almost twice as many hours on digital devices than they were in 2008, with more than half of that growth on mobile.

More people are spending more time on their phones, and this represents a great opportunity in research. We no longer have to rely on hand-picked or self-selecting groups of respondents that don’t represent the public’s real views. Since apps are so widely used, we can harness their broad reach to get our surveys into the hands of real people.

Professional Panelists vs App Survey-Takers

Respondents on traditional survey panels tend to take survey after survey. We all know that practice makes perfect, but with data you don’t want perfect; you want the truth. Many “professional panelists” are able to navigate questions more intelligently and manipulate the process to gain rewards. This sometimes leads to insincere results.

In comparison, app survey-takers are often new to the process and only take surveys every so often. These respondents tend to put more thought into how they answer, and are often more expressive. The experience of participating in research is still novel, and so their responses are more natural.

Virtual Rewards Means Less Fraud

Respondents taking surveys through mobile apps are awarded virtual rewards, such as in-game items or virtual currency. They are rewarded instantly, so there is no waiting for a monthly pay-out or gift card to come in the mail.

Instant in-app rewards are a great incentive, because they harness the power of useful (and sometimes addictive!) apps, while discouraging fraud. When the reward can only be spent in the app, people are much less likely to game the system.

Good News for Research

This new approach provides access to groups of people who were difficult to engage before, allows us to engage those users in a more natural way, and cuts down on fraud. This is great news for researchers who can use mobile app-recruited respondents to avoid the issues inherent in traditional panels.

Breaking Her Stunned And Traumatized Silence

Quick roundup - US initial claims continue to bounce around frenetically, but that is because of seasonal adjustment. Actual claims, allowing for the Thanksgiving delay in processing, are pretty steady. They are not very different from the prior year's. This is the current release, and with it I grumpily concede that claims are in the 380s rather than the 370s where I wanted them to be. While not dire, this is an unfavorable development.All-important inventories to sales ratios - Total business remains where it has been cycling, which obscures the unhappy fact that the reason we are seeing the slow down in production-type PMIs is that it is cycling - businesses are notching down employment in order to keep it cycling. The forward impetus you get by looking at wholesalers, and there we get news of another downward notch. Again, not dire, but again, unfavorable.Wholesalers adjust their buys so that inventory doesn't accumulate too much, which then passes through to manufacturers.Retail sales for November were okay, but not if you were a department store or a grocery chain operator. There is an obvious slowing in YoY gains for retail sales. Table 2 gives you rolling three month comparisons YoY and for the previous 3 months. The YoY is now 4.3%, but the previous 3 months is 2%. This data is not price-adjusted, of course. There is a relatively high current error in this report for each month's data, but the three-month totals should have much less variance. Grocery store sales dropped in November in comparison to October, which is a sign that consumers aren't that flush. Food spending dropped in Q4 last year as well; consumers cut their food expenditures to pay for other spending. This, btw, is the biggest single indicator that we are in a recession, and it is truly an amazing one, due to the continued expansion of the SNAP (food stamp) program. It is Table 2.3.6, real-dollar food and beverages purchased for off-premises consumption, and since Q2 2011 it has not moved. But the population has increased and our subsidy for food has increased. SNAP expenditures continue to rise by month, and they are roughly equivalent to a 1.5% payroll tax cut.

In fiscal year 2012, we spent 74.6 billion on SNAP, which is 9% of the total annualized BEA reported off-premises food consumption. (Table 2.3.5). In comparison, in fiscal year 2008 we spent 34.6 billion versus 740 billion total, or 4.7%. If this doesn't scare you witless, nothing will. Your mind is gone. You have exited the reality highway. You have achieved the nirvana of total mental drift, and you are floating in a warm sea of disassociation. There is also WIC, which at 4.8 billion in FY 2012 gets us to more like 9.5% of basic food expenditures.All this money, and the increasing population is buying less food per capita? This is Japanese-style deflation. The following BEA-generated chart shows CURRENT-dollar food trends:

It might be time to stop importing immigrants that need government subsidies to feed themselves. All we are doing is crushing the working-class population into the ground. In this context, it's easy to see why the Fed is launching a Treasury bond-buying program, which at an annual total of 540 billion, would amount to funding close to half the fiscal year 2012 federal deficit. But the reality is that any measure which does not restore the ability of the general population to buy food at at least a continuous per-capita level is doomed to fail as an economic stimulus. I do have one favorable thing to say of MMT versus current more mainstream economics - the MMTers generally do seem to really get that a theoretical increase in the money supply does not equate to an actual increase in the money supply. You can dump ""money"" into the system all day long, but without a circulating mechanism, the ""money"" does not exist in fact. Another aspect of our current future expectations is that GASB is gradually tightening up the standards for government pensions. The current change in standards will fully take effect in 2014, and it will force higher contribution levels for government pensions, which will further cramp a lot of state and local governmental budgets. Of course there is a loophole which would allow and indeed force marginally funded plans to use a higher discount rate for the first-pass calculation in order to avoid the forced low-end discount rate. But some plans don't have this option, and this should be an adventure in fiscal reality.

Well, I could write more, but I think I have come to the conclusion that the best way to proceed is to focus on real money supply in the context of theory and evidence. We can discuss what I think is happening to it, what MMT thinks it is, and what the Fed thinks it is doing to it!

We've gone to the lowest price food goods we can go...next stop is the dumpster behind the store...lol. Probably should've started there, the trip would've been shorter.I look forward to seeing your take on the MMT'ers and their (nominal versus real) financial prestidigitation. It's a neat trick, their use of operational identities as their proof of ""theory"" while unmooring the feedback between the nominal and the real economy. Global 3-card monte...AnonPA

TJ, I think you're right. Most of the people I know, myself included, are in a state of low confidence. Lots of money in CDs, MMAs, bonds, under the mattresses, and in gold/silver.

IMO, a restoration of confidence would release a torrent of investing and spending. Only one thing standing in its way - government policy. The regulations to strangle coal, tight formation fracking, and even regular oil/gas production are now ready to go.

A small businessman of my acquaintance has a big cash hoard. He's waiting for something that gives him the confidence to put it to work. Imagine that multiplied by millions of small businesses. Sure, it could cause another bubble. But that would be a nice problem to have compared to another four years of stagnation.

Jimmy - it's not clear that the Fed alone can produce inflation, but your comments point out why some of the Fed Heads are worried about inflation. Once the fire starts, at 4 Trillion in how does the Fed get out? Trying to pull that much money out of the economy could only be done over a period of years, so likely the Fed would raise rates. It would be messy to say the least, and very resistant to attempts at calibration.

Of course, our problems are not likely to clear up so one may doubt an explosion of confidence.

The biggest fallacy of MMT, I don’t even know why we are talking about this, is that all the money printing goes to bonds first to finance government spending. If money printing is so good then just print it and deposit it to the US Treasury’s bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank. That goes for all the other 12 central banks that are printing. Just think of all the world resources that go into managing all that debt (and all that trauma) that could be diverted to more productive uses.

I guess as long as the Velocity of money is not zero the more the Fed pumps in the more it should help the economy. That said I think the velocity of money may be structurally zero.

As I've commented before we've passed the tipping point with the reelection of Obama. The class warfare he preaches will do nothing but widen the gulf between the haves and have nots. Pity. As in the ""Only Nixon can go to China"" theme he could sort out spending and entitlements but he's too wrapped up in the hate the rich meme to see the light or seize the opportunity.

Obama doesn't realize that Fed stimulus actually widens the income gap. He can try to ram through tax increases for the top 10%, but if he doesn't get the budget balanced and federal regulation/control reduced (and he is incapable of such) then there will be no choice but more Fed money printing which essentially undoes any income gap compression the tax increases would enable.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Apple stores your Siri queries for up to two years

Apple keeps your Siri data in its servers for up to two years, it has been revealed.

Apple keeps your Siri data in its servers for up to two years, it has been revealed.

Apple spokesperson Trudy Muller told Wired that the company only collects Siri voice clips, which can include questions, messages and other commands, in order to improve the voice-activated personal assistant that was launched with the iPhone 4S in 2011. ""Our customers' privacy is very important to us,"" she said, adding that Apple takes steps to ensure that the data is kept anonymous.

Wired explains that, when a user speaks to Siri, the voice-clip gets sent to Apple's data farm for analysis. Apple creates a random string of numbers to represent the user, therefore keeping their identity anonymous. Each time that user speaks to Siri, the same string of numbers (which is not an Apple ID or email address) will be associated to the voice clips collected.

After six months, Apple ""disassociates"" the number from the voice recording, but can keep the file for up to 18 more months in order to carry out further testing and help improve Siri, Muller said.

""Apple may keep anonymised Siri data for up to two years,"" Muller added. ""If a user turns Siri off, both identifiers are deleted immediately along with any associated data.""

You can turn Siri off on your supported iOS device by going to Settings > General > Siri.

While its understandable that Apple would want to keep Siri data in order to improve the service, American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Nicole Ozer says that Apple should make it clear to users that this is the case in its Siri FAQ, with a link to the Siri Privacy policy. At present, users can only find the Siri Privacy policy within the settings of an iPad or iPhone, so they aren't made aware of Apple's storage of voice clips until after purchasing an iOS device.

""There is no good reason for Apple not to include information about privacy practices on their Siri FAQ page,"" Ozer told Wired, adding that, while data is anonymous, ""what you say to Siri could reveal sensitive things about you, your family, or business.""

Gigaom's Erica Ogg highlights that Apple's two years of data storage is longer than Yahoo, Microsoft and Google's, all of which retain search data for 18 months.

"Five Crazy Headlines: Babies for sale, a DUI hood ornament and a cartoon getaway van

How much is a baby worth nowadays? In China, one was enough to buy a new iPhone and a motorbike.

A young couple were arrested in China after they sold their 18-day-old baby to a man they met through the Chinese messaging app QQ. The couple planned on using the money from the sale to buy several different items including a motorbike and an iPhone.

The 19-year-old father was sentenced by a judge to three years in jail, while the underage mother of the baby received a two and a half year suspended sentence since she had not yet completed her schooling.

After hearing about the arrests of the parents, the man who bought the baby turned himself in to authorities, but it is unclear at this time if he has been sentenced to jail time. The baby is now being raised by the sister of the buyer, as the judge determined that the conditions the birth parents currently faced were too difficult for raising a child.

"Simon Cowell Just Let Slip Which X Factor Judges Are Paid The Most!

There has always been speculation about the pay packets of the panel but Simon has just added fuel to the fire.

When it comes to judges on the X Factor, it's only the best for Simon Cowell.

The talent show boss is no stranger to coughing up the cash either, with reports he was prepared to pay Mariah Carey £1 million to appear on the panel.

With just weeks to go until X Factor returns to our screens for its thirteenth series with Simon Cowell has shed light on just how much his co-judges are being paid and even let slip that some are paid more than others.

According to the SyCo label boss, Sharon Osbourne and Nicole Scherzinger and former judge Cheryl cost him the most money they paid favourably in comparison to fellow judge Louis Walsh, who is also set to reprise his role on the panel this year.

Simon believes paying his female stars more is a pioneering move and a stark contrast to the BBC, who received backlash last month after their highest paid stars were revealed to be men.

Speaking about his female co-stars, he told The Sun: “For once this is good news. Victory. Yeah, they definitely are [paid more]. I just don’t tell Louis.”

"Despite his recent legal troubles, rapper DMX received some good news yesterday (May 16), when a Maryland judge overturned a $1.5 million defamation judgment against him.

The judgment, which was handed down in January, came as a result of a defamation of character lawsuit brought against DMX by Monique Wayne.

The suit stemmed from allegations the rapper (born Earl Simmons) made during a 2006 interview with Sister 2 Sister magazine.

In the story, Simmons claimed he was raped by Wayne while staying at a hotel in Baltimore in 2003.

Simmons comments triggered a $6 million lawsuit that was filed by Wayne in Prince George’s County Circuit Court in Upper Marlboro, Md., in October 2006.

The rapper was later ordered to pay Wayne $518,400 in compensation and $1 million in punitive penalties after missing a scheduled court hearing for the case in January.

Soon after, Simmons hired The Murphy Firm, a Baltimore-based law firm, to dispute the ruling.

According to reports, the New York native was unaware that a hearing was scheduled to take place.

Despite the initial outcome, Hassan Murphy, a managing partner of The Murphy Firm, was happy to see his client vindicated by the new ruling, which was handed down by Judge Thomas P. Smith.

“Today a very large judgment was vacated by Judge Smith,” Murphy told AllHipHop.com in a statement. “The judge clearly agreed with us that Mr. Simmons was never properly notified and therefore he threw out the judgment.”

Although the overturned judgment ended Simmons’ week on a good note, the rapper is still mired in legal drama.

Earlier this month, the rapper was arrested on numerous motor vehicle charges stemming from a January incident that involved him driving 114 mph on a local highway with a suspended license.

On Thursday (May 15), Simmons pleaded not guilty to various felony drug charges and animal cruelty charges, after arriving an hour late to a court appearance in front of Maricopa County Superior Court Commissioner Lisa VandenBerg.

The court appearance followed a May 9 raid of the rappers Cave Creek, Arizona home that came after a seven month investigation into animal cruelty charges.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"WoW Tailoring Guide 1-600

This WoW Tailoring Guide details the most efficient method of leveling Tailoring from levels 1 to 600 in the World of Warcraft. Tailoring is a primary profession (of which you can only choose two at any point in the game) and allows your character to create a variety of items such as armor, bags and clothing. Tailoring probably complements the Enchanting profession better than any other, as the items that are crafted with Tailoring can be disenchanted to provide materials for Enchanting.

Updated for WoW patch 5.2

This guide focuses on making the training path easier by using patterns that can be learned from Tailoring trainers and patterns with the most easily obtained materials.

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, Metabolic syndrome, Obesity, Insulin resistance, Liver fibrosis, NAFLD treatment Sažetak: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has, although it is a very common disorder, only relatively recently gained broader interest among physicians and scientists. Fatty liver has been documented in up to 10 to 15 percent of normal individuals and 70 to 80 percent of obese individuals. Although the pathophysiology of NAFLD is still subject to intensive research, several players and mechanisms have been suggested based on the substantial evidence. Excessive hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation resulting from insulin resistance is the first step in the proposed 'two hit' model of the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Oxidative stress resulting from mitochondrial fatty acids oxidation, NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory cytokine expression and adipocytokines are all considered to be the potential factors causing second hits which lead to hepatocyte injury, inflammation and fibrosis. Although it was initially believed that NAFLD is a completely benign disorder, histologic follow-up studies have showed that fibrosis progression occurs in about a third of patients. A small number of patients with NAFLD eventually ends up with end-stage liver disease and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Although liver biopsy is currently the only way to confirm the NAFLD diagnosis and distinguish between fatty liver alone and NASH, no guidelines or firm recommendations can still be made as for when and in whom it is necessary. Increased physical activity, gradual weight reduction and in selected cases bariatric surgery remain the mainstay of NAFLD therapy. Studies with pharmacologic agents are showing promising results, but available data are still insufficient to make specific recommendations ; their use therefore remains highly individual.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"I don't have personal experience to contribute but after talking to a friend who's been through the cloth diaper routine a few times, I changed my planned ""all pre-fold all the time"" stance to a combo of prefold and pocket diapers.

Apparently the pockets are great for overnight, since you can stuff them with extra inserts or more absorbent inserts or whatever. She also directed me towards http://jilliansdrawers.com/ , which has a trial set where you can try out a bunch of brands before committing. As far as I can tell, brand loyalty is basically a religious issue and babies vary in how they fit a given brand, so I'm a little scared to buy a lot before trying them.

for us, pockets at night were great when i changed him during the night, but now, its all about how much stuffin i can get on his bottom at night, and layers of prefolds are more effective, and i throw a sheet of microfleece over it to act like the stay dry of a pocket. Of course i couldn't shell out for the hitech pocket stuffin, and just stuff my pockets with prefolds. that said, they are my diaper bag, out and about diapers, all three of them.

For out and about I really like my Bummis wet bag - I have a size small, which is 10"" x 12"" and just right for about three medium sized prefolds, but you can get bigger ones if you use pockets or want it to hold more. I like it because it has a zipper, and the handle unsnaps so I can hang it on something if I need to.

I got wet bags from SnuggyBaby on Etsy, but they have their own website you can order from, too. Here are the wet bags. I haven't used them yet (stillllllllll pregnant), but they seem really well made and come in some super cute patterns (which is kind of pointless, but I'm a sucker for cute fabric).

I have a diaper sprayer, but again: haven't used it yet. I don't know why I keep posting in this thread when I don't actually have anyone to diaper yet.

i have that exact diaper sprayer. i didn't worry too much about breastfeeding poops since they were pure liquid, but once he started eating solids it came in handy. the only thing is the pressure is REALLY touchy, and if you aren't careful you're going to get backsprayed with poo water...

_________________Gwyneth Paltrow: ""I'm superstitious. Whenever I start a new movie I kill a hobo with a hammer.""

I saw (but didn't actually read) an article about the dangers of diaper sprayers. I think because of strangulation risks. If you have one or plan to get one I would read it. I think I saw it on the diaper junction blog. I am not saying not to use one but I see the potential hazard, so make sure you have the bathroom door baby proofed.

Oh my! I love it! I'm of huge fan of fabric and paper for that matter with design. I actually have the fabric for the ""Tranquil Leaves Wet Bag"" as a camera bag that I bought on Etsy.

i don't have a sprayer- i dunk diapers in the toilet or shake of more solid poops into the toilet. I used to use a scraper, but in the last move, it disappeared (it was a golden cake scraper i picked up at a thrift store, i could replace it, but i'm to cheap and lazy). as they said, until they start solids, you don't need to worry about it. I also figure it keeps me washing my hands, which i should do anyway.

oh, and on the cheap and lazy note, for diapering out and about i keep a couple plastic shopping bags in the zippered compartment of my backpack for wet bags.

What is your night time set-up? I've been using Nature's Best disposables at night, because they're easier when I'm half asleep and because, now that he's sleeping for more than 2 hours at a time, I don't want a wet diaper against his skin. But lately it seems we have a poop leak every night--poop goes up his back, through his pajamas, and onto my sheets. I never have leaks when he's in cloth, so disposables are actually turning out to be more work. Plus they smell bad. I want to make the switch to cloth at night, so I ordered some fleece-lined hemp doublers. Most nights he's not pooping until 4 or 5am (I think) so if he's in the same diaper 10pm-4am, he's not sitting in poop. Green Mountain Diapers recommends wool for overnight, but obviously I'd like to avoid that. Do you have special covers for nighttime, or do you just use your regular covers with extra absorbency inside?

I only had two covers that were Nikky brand. I always saved them for night time because they were bullet proof and fully breathable poly. They run about $14.00 new and worth ever single penny. Nikkys have been around since the early 80's and rival any of todays brands. I would highly receommend trying one for nightime.

my two sons never pooped during the night, but they pee'd twice as much as my daughter and nursed every 1-2 hours untile the bitter end. I swear I birthed little piggies. The nikkys were great.

I noticed turd through the window of the front-load washer while I was running a load of diapers last night. My husband kindly disposed of it. I guess I need to start making sure all the disposable liners have been flushed. I don't know how that one got past us. ;p

Hahaha! I couldn't help but get a mental picture of Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo from South Park when I read this. Not helpful at all, but it gave me a hearty laugh...On a more helpful note, I really love my Maxwell Designs Diaper Bag, Wet Bag and Changing Pad. My wet bag sounds exactly like what Poopie B described. Also, if you are interested, the Maxwell Designs chic will match your changing pad, diaper bag and wet bag, if you are into that sort of thing. Linky http://tootsntots.com/main/shop/categor ... l-designs/I got the XL and to be honest, I could have gotten by with the L or M.

Like Mel I have the Maxwell gear - bag, change pad and wetbag. Mine match because I am into that sorta thing ;) I do love that it zips from a mess containing perspective, but I actually like one of the other bags I have from http://www.applecheeks.com better (it's drawstring style) because I find it easier to load diapers into without getting my hands messy. And maybe it's just me, but I've found having more than 1 wetbag to be pretty beneficial, as sometimes we have crazy weekends and I don't have time to wash one or wait for it to dry before we have to head out again.

For overnight, we actually put one of our applecheeks inserts into one of our BumGenius AIO diapers and have never had a leak. We were getting all kinds of leaks with every other combination we tried (we have pockets, the Bumgenius, and a bunch of fitteds with covers - were never into prefolds) but I think we have hit the jackpot.

I thought this was a useful page: http://www.esbaby.net/whatdoineed.htm I am still pregnant myself but just spent a good part of the weekend navigating this and interrogating my cloth diapering friends!

Things I have learned:- one-size diapers are great, and eventually if I like them I plan to use a mix of one size Fuzzibunz and Flip system. (with flip cloth inserts most of the time and maybe disposable inserts when we travel).. HOWEVER, even my friend with giant babies finds that her kids don't fit well into ""one size"" diapers until they're a little over 10 lbs, so it's good to have some newborn or small diapers to span that 7-12 lb range. (Assuming you plan to have big babies - my mom and MIL churned 'em out in the 7.5-10+ range so I'm not too worried about fitting a 5lber myself!) From reading around it does sound like the Flip diapers can possibly be used with larger newborns, but I've decided to get plenty of NB options just in case.

- count on using about 12 inserts or all-in-one/pocket diapers per day for a newborn, larger babies go less frequently. So then you multiply by how often you want to do laundry, and you probably don't want to go over 3 days because things will get rank. If you plan to air dry, leave time for that! So personally my plan is to have 3 days' worth of diapers, so that means 36 changes.

- For all-in-one/pocket diapers, that means one per change for the most part

- For prefolds (those are pieces of cloth sewn on the side that you have to put inside a cover) or fitted diapers (these look a little like all-in-ones and have snaps or velcro to hold them together, BUT they're made of non-waterproof material so if you go out or baby moves a lot you need a cover on that), you'll need one prefold or fitted per change PLUS a certain number of covers (that site recommends 5-9 total for a 3 day supply). The covers are just a waterproof shell that go over the diaper.

- Personally I've been mulling the tradeoff between nice matchy-match commercial system vs. collecting a little of everything and seeing what I like. After talking it over with the husband and doing some research I've decided that with newborn diapers I'm going to get a few each of different things. All babies are shaped differently and even the same TYPE of diaper can fit very differently between brands! I guess this is why some people RAVE about one brand while others hate it, and vice versa with another brand. So I'm preparing to be flexible! But after doing gobs of research, here's what my newborn shopping list is:

[ ] Small Fuzzibunz in various colors: 6-8 (these are pocket diapers, so very convenient for nighttime!) Zulily has these on sale for >1/2 off every once in a while so I'm planning on waiting for the next sale. Already have a couple, they seem very soft and well-made.[ ] Fitted newborn diapers: 6 (lots of options on etsy with cute fabrics! my friend says that if you're just at home with baby still immobile, you don't necessarily need a cover. If you go out, you do. I figure these will be almost as easy as the fuzzibunz at night[ ] Small size indian prefolds - 24 (they're cheap)[ ] Snappis - 2 - these hold the prefolds in place if you don't want to use diaper pins. You need to replace them every 6 mos and need 1-2 of them.[ ] NB/small covers - need 5, ordered 8 of a couple types - Bummis with snaps and the suspiciously cheap Real Nappies with velcro[ ] One Flip system one-size day pack - 2 covers + 6 inserts. I don't know if these will fit a young baby but I'm going to try.[ ] Pondering getting a few newborn all in ones, since there are cute inexpensive ones on etsy.

I also am planning on the husband not wanting to do elaborate prefold securing in the middle of the night (nor will I probably!), so I'm hoping to find what works for us among pocket diapers, all-in-ones, and fitted diapers.

It sounds like some brands of velcro are easier to remove by older babies than others. I'm not worried about this for NBs, and planning on going with snaps personally because I don't like velcro, but it does sound like it's slightly easier to put on (and, thus, take off).

Oh I forgot to mention: one important thing with newborns is that the umbilical cord shouldn't be covered/bothered by a diaper. So for example these newborn fitted diapers (again, these aren't waterproof so they need a cover with them), have a little notch where it's lower to accommodate that: http://www.etsy.com/listing/66693480/tiny-flowers-newborn-tt-fitted-cloth?ref=v1_other_2 Now I don't quite understand exactly what is and isn't compatible, but apparently you can adjust prefolds a little so they're folded under, and some diapers seem to have a setting where the front can be put lower.. The frustrating thing is that talking to people it seems like the cord can come off anywhere between a couple days after birth to weeks and weeks! so it's tough to say how much you need to accommodate this. Maybe the expert diaperers can chime in about this. I'm pretty sure, though, that for example the small fuzzi bunz I bought might not be usable the first few days because of this issue. I've heard of friends just sticking with disposables until the cord is gone and healed, to avoid the issue entirely.

And so my backup plan is to just have a pack or two of disposables, honestly. I also considered just going with those until the baby is big enough to fit into one size because the amount you'll spend on newborn cloth diapers can pay for itself if you have a preemie, but if your baby is larger they might be in newborn sizes just a few weeks! For a cost comparison, It looked on diapers.com that Pampers Swaddlers for newborns worked out to about $3/day.

Also, EVERY brand seems to have different sizing, so be careful about that, but it sounds like weighs are also just guidelines and you'll need to adjust the fit and even how much absorbent material you stuff in the diaper to suit your particular baby! ACK! I hope all this gets a lot more obvious once I have a baby in diapers.. I agree that it is incredibly confusing! I feel like I spent most of the weekend on this and it's still a mystery.

I bought newborn prefolds and covers from Green Mountain Diapers. Prefolds are just squares of quilty cotton fabric that you either pin around the baby or fold in thirds and hold in place with a waterproof cover. Prefolds and covers are the cheapest option, and I've found them very, very easy. My husband only changes one or two diapers each day and always says he can't believe how easy they are. I have pins but I like the snappis fasteners.

Green Mountain Diapers has a newborn starter package that lets you try a sampling of different brands of covers. That's a good idea, because you just don't know what you'll like until you try it. I thought I would like velcro, but then it curled under and scratched my son, so now I only use covers with snaps. The covers I thought were adorable had leg holes that were way too small for my kid, so I'm glad I waited before ordering lots of covers in larger sizes. I like thirsties duo covers--size small fits birth through about 15 lbs., size large lasts 15 lbs. until potty training (or so they say). You should just try several brands, see what is easy for you and what fits your kid best.

How many diapers and covers you need for a newborn depends on how big your baby is and how fast he/she grows, which is impossible to know now. Walter was out of newborn covers in 3 weeks, so those were kind of a waste of money. But if he had been tiny for a long time, the next size up would have been too big and leaky. So yes, you may end up wasting money on diapers that are too small. An alternative is to just use disposable until the baby grows into size smalls. We used disposables about half the time the first 2-3 weeks. It just felt easier; I was overwhelmed and didn't feel like figuring out a washing routine. Now I think cloth is easier than disposable, but just tossing the diapers in the trash made the first weeks (esp. nighttime) go more smoothly.

You're not the only one who finds this all confusing; I spent DAYS reading cloth diapering websites trying to figure it out. The good news is, once you're actually doing it every day, it'll seem easy.

You're not the only one who finds this all confusing; I spent DAYS reading cloth diapering websites trying to figure it out. The good news is, once you're actually doing it every day, it'll seem easy.

Ha ha. No kidding. I remember being really confused and concerned about it.

We went with prefolds and covers (the Thirsties Duos, which are two sizes... which for us were basically newborn and post-newborn) with the plan of moving on to AIOs as the Emperor got older/we could afford them. But I actually found that AIOs aren't a good match for us. They take forever to dry, for one thing, and we don't have a dryer. We ended up sticking with just prefolds etc and I expect that's what he'll be in for the duration.

I think there's no real way to know what's going to work for you and your baby til you've got the kid. Alas...

By the way, mitten, our nighttime diaper is pretty simple. We use super huge prefolds (toddler sized maybe?), tri fold them, then fold the front over so it's doubled up. So he's got basically six layers of prefold in his pee area overnight. It works really well now that he's older-- we barely every have nighttime leaks.

It's really hard to diaper babies so they don't leak some substance when they're younger. We didn't have poop leaks, but we did often have pee leaks when he was younger.

I'm another hardcore prefold fan (I love the thirstie duo covers and my husband likes the bummi super brights). We've tried AIOs and pockets, but they've always leaked on us or seem way too baggy. Turns out the cheapest route was the best fix for us! (love when that actually happens!)",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"You are Bigger than Your Anxiety

Today’s article is brought to you by AG contributor Bryan3000. Bryan and I have been exchanging ideas for weeks and I’ve enjoyed those conversations. I think that you’ll enjoy his perspective as well.

— Paul Dooley

So, it’s another Sunday afternoon and I’m lucky enough to be spending some time at home, playing with my little four year old girl and watching football. Life doesn’t get much better. That said, as I sat there… I had some of the usual slow-boiling anxiety that seems to just hang around some days for no particular reason. Attempting to use the things I’ve learned, I did my best to simply accept the symptoms and go about my day.

My little girl also was dealing with her own health issues that day. She had another cold, which seem to come on an almost weekly basis at this age. Her forehead felt a little hot, her nose was runny and she occasionally looked up from her toys to cough a few hacking coughs. As I sat dealing with my own discomfort, it dawned on me that she must have been dealing with a good deal of her own. Her outward symptoms surely weren’t the only ones.

These colds almost always come with a host of uncomfortable effects on our heads, bodies, moods, etc. Sure, she seemed a little crabby at times, but she kept right on focusing on the little play-set and animal figures she had set up… mouthing words for them to talk to each other, and creating her own little fictional world. She was completely immersed in what she was doing.

All of those symptoms, and yet no complaining from her. It appeared to be the furthest thing from her mind. Now, a cynical mind might look at this situation and assume that she’s just a child. She doesn’t know the real dangers of health issues. She’s too young to have developed an actual sense of self-awareness with regards to her health.

But, there’s another way to look at this. This child of four years has certainly dealt with sickness before. She’s been to the doctor. She’s gotten shots. (She just loves those!) She’s aware of medication and sometimes even claims to need it. (Likely because it’s cherry-flavored and sugary.) She’s not oblivious to the concept of illness. Instead, she’s just simply not that impressed with it. Of course, at some point… she’ll have a rough flu or illness that does slow her down. It’s part of growing up. But right now, she’s got a view of her illness that just might be one we can all learn from.

Now, I’m certainly not the first to suggest that we’re larger than our afflictions. This is a well-covered topic. However, it may be a concept that we need to remind ourselves of, and on a regular basis. The reality of my daughter and I sitting in that living room that day was that her illness was likely a much bigger threat to her than my simmering anxiety was
to me.

In fact, by this point if you’ve read or listened to enough material from this very website, you know anxiety symptoms aren’t dangerous at all. Yet, there I was doing my best to accept and flow with my symptoms,struggling at times as she sat care-free playing with her toys and urging me to do the same.

The problem with panic and anxiety is that by its very nature, it feels so much larger in scope than it really is. The symptoms come on in such a way that it affects that very brain mechanisms that estimate a perceived threat. It’s function is to convince us that we are in trouble. As we all know, that is its biological purpose and is part of all of our make-up. Yet, if you’re reading this, you also probably know that anxiety itself is not a real threat. As Dr. Claire Weeks put it, “don’t be bluffed by a thought.”

You are bigger than anxiety. The reality on a short-term basis is that anxiety is probably far-less dangerous than the common cold and certainly less dangerous than the flu. (No, you shouldn’t be afraid of the flu, either!) We all need to remind ourselves every day just how big we are and just how small anxiety really is.

Think of your body, mind, spirit, and all of the things that comprise your being. Think of what you’ve accomplished and want to accomplish. Think of the mind you’ve been blessed with and the positive attributes you’ve been given, physically. We all have them, regardless of our conditions. Think of the complex tasks your body completes every day without any effort on your part. Think of all the illnesses your body has defeated over your lifetime. We’re all giants in so many regards. Anxiety pales in comparison.

No one else sees your anxiety. It doesn’t even make your nose run! People see you, the giant entity that you are. We all need to give ourselves this daily reminder so the picture becomes (and remains) crystal clear. If we can all view ourselves as bigger than the problem, perhaps we can eventually deal with anxiety as easily as a child deals with a cold.

As for me, I did manage to work through the symptoms and enjoy much of the day. I’ll now remember that Sunday as a special time spent with my child, not for the bothersome physical symptoms. I have my struggles like we all do, but life only offers so many of those moments. I don’t intend to let anxiety take them away from me. I hope you won’t, either.

Comments

Bryan, I agree 100%. I have a four yr old of my own and that guy could care less about feeling bad for too long. He really does have better things to do. And although it is partly ignorance on his part, the bottom-line is that if you don’t focus on the negative, that negative issue shrinks in size. It’s when you sit and worry that the trouble starts. Great article.

Hey Emily, thanks for thinking of me. Bryan is right, if you go to the home page and click on the Anxiety Superhero article you’ll find highlighted links to the book title that will take you straight to amazon.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"How do I stop my dog lunging at traffic?

(Q) I have awful trouble walking my dog because she lunges and barks at traffic, and she almost has me off my feet. She especially does this with lorries and buses.

(A) Jackie Drakeford says: First you need to restore control for your own safety, and I recommend getting a harness that has the lead attachment on the chest. Walk your dog from a lead on her collar, but have a second lead on the harness. It's a lot easier than it sounds to work with two leads, and the beauty of this arrangement is that when your dog lunges, the chest fastening means that as the harness lead comes into play, it turns her towards you.

Next you need to look at your dog's motivation. Most dogs who do this are trying to scare the traffic away, because there is a big element of fear involved. Not only is there the size to consider, but the noise, vibration, and the diesel fumes at dog height make these vehicles a very unpleasant experience for the dog as they go by. And of course the traffic does go away, so your dog thinks her actions have succeeded, which is rewarding her.

Her imagined success brings with it a big rush of excitement hormones, which are highly addictive, and so prompt her to repeat this behaviour for the thrill of it. Thrill and fear are very closely linked in the mind. If your dog is a herding breed, then she is also genetically programmed to dive at moving things and get them moving faster, so there is yet another another huge reward in this.

Every dog has a reaction distance. Right now, you are too close to the traffic, so find places where you can both observe it while being far enough away that your dog doesn't feel the need to react. Sit together watching the traffic going by, while rewarding calm behaviour with a few treats, a toy or a game. If your dog reacts, you are still too close. Go to places where large vehicles are parked, and walk by at a sufficient distance that your dog doesn't react, and reward as before. Don't rush this, but be happy with small victories, and keep lessons very short — five minutes is ample to begin with. These are training sessions, and she will still need to be walked, but away from traffic so she can enjoy a calm time out exercising.

At home, concentrate on giving your dog an occupation that makes her think, such as puzzle toys, stuffed Kongs, and scattering some of her food about the garden for her to search out. This will satisfy the reward centres in her brain to replace the high she gets from attacking traffic.

Using these methods together, you will gradually desensitise her to traffic, but it will take time and you must go at her pace. Your aim is to stop the lesson before she reacts rather than pushing her to the point when she does.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"CLARK — A park in Clark that will host this weeks’s Union County MusicFest, expected to draw tens of thousands of spectators this weekend, has been sprayed for mosquitoes after health officials discovered an insect carrying the West Nile Virus there last week.

A mosquito pool, used by health officials to trap insects for testing, tested positive on Aug. 31, the county said. The pool was located in Oak Ridge Park, the site of the county’s annual free concert festival.

“It is not uncommon to find West Nile Virus in mosquito pools throughout the county, and the state of New Jersey as a whole,” Sebastian D’Elia, a county spokesman, said in an e-mail Thursday afternoon. “When it is found, the site is immediately treated.”

The state Department of Health and Senior Services, as well as local health offices throughout New Jersey, regularly test mosquitoes for the virus. Hundreds of insects regularly test positive, state reports show.

But cases of humans contracting the disease are rare, both the state and county said. In the past several years, there has been only one confirmed human case of the virus in Union County, D’Elia said.

MusicFest started earlier this week but will host its featured acts this weekend. Bands include headliners Train and Spoon, as well as OK GO, Soul Asylum, Suzanne Vega, The Bravery and The Zombies.

D'Elia urged those planning to attend the concerts to take common precautions such as wearing long pants and applying mosquito repellent.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"King Kong to Open on Broadway

The long-anticipated musical of King Kong, itself based on the 1932 novel of the same name by Merian C. Cooper, will finally be coming to Broadway, complete with the titular mammoth ape. Set to open on November 8, 2018 at the Broadway Theatre, the musical will utilize an innovative mix of robotics, puppetry, and stagecraft to bring this character to life. The production will be directed and choreographed by Oliver Award-winner Drew McOnie (In the Heights).

“Based on the 1932 novel, the stage production of King Kong is a contemporary take on the classic tale of beauty and the beast. The story follows a young actress and a maverick filmmaker as they voyage from the bustling streets of 1930s New York to an uncharted island to capture the greatest wonder the world has ever seen. At the center of this 21st-century reimagining: a 20-foot high, 2,000-pound gorilla brought to life by a team of seamlessly integrated artists and technicians. King Kong is a larger-than-life encounter with a legend that’s always been too big to contain.”

King Kong’s book writer Jack Thorne won the 2017 Olivier Award and the Evening Standard Award for Best Play for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which is poised to make its Broadway premiere this spring. The musical features a score by composer and music producer Marius de Vries (the films La La Land, Moulin Rouge, and Romeo + Juliet) who is a four-time Grammy nominee. Eddie Perfect (songs) is a Helpmann Award winner and composer and lyricist of the Broadway-bound Beetlejuice, Strictly Ballroom The Musical and Shane Warne The Musical.

The design team for the Broadway production of King Kong will include Peter England (Set and Projection Design), Sonny Tilders (Creature Design), Roger Kirk (Costume Design), Peter Mumford (Lighting Design), Peter Hylenski (Sound Design), Gavin Robins (Aerial and King Kong Movement Director). Casting will be announced at a later date.

Interesting mix of various terrain, with sections between the Pinawa Heritage Dam site and the suspension bridge just recently cut and still somewhat soft. This trail is part of the Trans Canada Trail and is well marked and should be well maintained. This is a multi use trail so priority and curtesy should be extended to hikers/walkers. Trail winds also through the town of Pinawa with more users there so be careful with joggers/hikers etc. Shield terrain between the suspension bridge and the town but nothing more than intermediate ability needed and maybe less if you are willing to walk a few limited sections.

"Celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day in the Classroom with these Resources

Celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ Day in the Classroom with these Resources

Since just last year, four new major American cities (Seattle, Grand Rapids, Minneapolis, and St. Paul) have followed an example set by Berkeley, CA and renamed Columbus Day as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. In addition to being a landmark decision for long marginalized Native American communities, Seattle’s resolution extends all the way to their classrooms. The city’s resolution strongly encourages schools in Seattle to teach students about the history of indigenous people and to use the day to celebrate vibrant Native American cultures.

Many states, cities, and local communities have opted to celebrate Native American history and culture in lieu of Columbus Day, and the trend is certainly growing. To help educators celebrate this new and inspiring holiday, here are some ideas for teaching about indigenous peoples as well as educational resources on the topic.

Challenge Native Americans Stereotypes

Stereotyping is a problem for many communities. Often Native Americans are depicted as a single homogenous group, when in reality there is huge diversity between tribes, or they are shown as an anachronism from the past, even though they have contemporary lives in thriving communities. Here are some resources that can help deconstruct these and other stereotypes:

• Unlearning “Indian” Stereotypes – This short video teaches students about racial stereotypes and the history of Native Americans through the eyes of a young person. This resource is available for purchase through Rethinking Schools.

Teach the Entire Story of Columbus Arriving in America

Most people learn in school that in “1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue”, but what is often overlooked is that Columbus started the enslavement and genocide of the Taíno. The details about Columbus’ treatment of Taíno are upsetting, but there are resources for teaching students of all ages about this topic:

• Morning Girl by Michael Dorris and Encounter by Jane Yolen – These two books tell the story of Columbus’ arrival from the perspective of Taíno children. Morning Girl is for grades 4-6, and Encounter is for grades 3-5.

• The Columbus Controversy – This video, by the Zinn Education Project, tells the history of Columbus’ arrival in American and his enslavement of the Taíno. This resource is appropriate for grades 6 and up.

Celebrate Native American Contributions and Culture

There are over 560 federally recognized tribes and many more that are not officially recognized. Each tribe has its own culture, tradition, and identity. Not only do Native American tribes have vibrant cultures, but they have also contributed greatly to everything from modern medicine to the theory of American democracy. Here are some resources for teaching about the rich culture and contributions of indigenous peoples:

• Native Stock – This website contains over 150,000 stock photos and videos of Native Americans. Images show Native Americans wearing both modern and traditional clothing and engaging in a variety of activities – everything from weaving to skateboarding.

• Pre-Columbian Native People and Technology – This lesson from Teaching Tolerance, for grades 6-12, has students explore the generally accepted belief that before Christopher Columbus arrived in America, the indigenous people were “primitive” or “lacked technology”. Through this lesson, students learn that, in reality, Native Americans created sophisticated buildings, culture, and medicine before the arrival of Europeans.

Hi Laura. The organization, Teaching for Change, has a great list of books about American Indian. Here is a link to that section of their webiste [https://socialjusticebooks.org/booklists/american-indians/]

"Nigeria election body declares official vote results

Nigeria’s electoral commission has announced the official results of the country’s presidential election, declaring opposition leader Mohammadu Buhari the winner of the polls.

Buhari, a 72-year-old former military ruler from the All Progressives Congress (APC) Party, won 15,424,921 votes or 53.95 percent of the 28,587,564 total valid ballots cast, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) said on Wednesday.

“Muhammadu Buhari… having satisfied the requirement for the law and scored the highest number of votes is hereby declared the winner,” INEC Chairman Attahiru Jega said.

Jonathan had conceded defeat to Buhari and congratulated him in a statement released on Tuesday.

The vote was the eighth election since Africa’s most populous country won independence from Britain in 1960. It is the first time in Nigeria’s history that a challenger has defeated a sitting president.

Buhari ruled Nigeria from January 1984 until August 1985 following a military coup in December 1983.

In the recent election, he received more votes in Nigeria’s northwestern states, hit hardest by the acts of violence committed by Takfiri Boko Haram terrorists. In Borno state, for instance, he won 94 percent of the votes. Many had criticized Jonathan’s handling of the violence.

Boko Haram extremists have claimed responsibility for a number of deadly shooting attacks and bombings in various parts of Nigeria since the beginning of their militancy in 2009, which has so far left over 13,000 people dead and 1.5 million displaced.

People in the oil-rich West African country turned out en masse to vote on Saturday. The election was extended to Sunday, on the account that ballot papers arrived late or imported card readers failed to recognize the fingerprints of the voters.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Adventures in being a volunteer advocate to fight poverty while raising children. My insights are seen through the lens of motherhood and a desire to help moms uplift each other to make a better world for our kids.
By Cynthia Changyit Levin, @ccylevin

Wednesday, February 18, 2009

When my wife and I slipped into our theater seats to watch Slumdog Millionaire, we braced ourselves for a journey into urban slums, a world inhabited by over one billion people globally.

But unlike the movie-goers in the theater that night who pinned their hopes for one chai wallah (tea seller) escaping the horrors of the slums of Mumbai, India, on the long-shot odds of his winning the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, we knew that right now there is a tool that has helped not just one movie character but more than 100 million of the world’s poorest people actually begin to escape the worst devastations of poverty. That opportunity is not a game show but microcredit—small loans to start or expand businesses like selling tortillas or cell phone time to your neighbors. And if there was an Oscar for assisting beggars, thieves, and prostitutes to find a dignified route out of the slums, I’d know where to look for the winner.

I wouldn’t look in the cool dark of a movie theater, but in the bright, hot sun of Nairobi where you can see the success of entrepreneurs in the urban slums, Jami Bora’s “slumdog entrepreneurs.” Jamii Bora, which means good families, is a Kenyan microfinance institution that has grown from lending money to 50 women beggars ten years ago to serving more than 200,000 members today. One of those entrepreneurs is Joyce Wairimu. Wairimu was one of the 50 women beggars who started Jamii Bora with founder Ingrid Munro in 1999. Munro calls Wairimu one of the fast climbers out of poverty. How fast? In ten years Wairimu has built six businesses and employs 62 people.

Another of the fast climbers is Wilson Maina. Before Jamii Bora, Maina was a thief, one of the most wanted criminals in Mathare Valley slum. Starting with a loan of $20, Maina has built four businesses and a new life for himself and his family. Along the way, he has convinced hundreds of youth to get out of crime. Now that’s a “lifeline” that really matters.

Munro didn’t stop at proving microcredit to help the poorest slum dwellers. She decided to build a town with decent housing and business space for her entrepreneurs. “Every poor person’s dream is to move out of the slums,” Munro says, “not patch up the slums.” On January 30th, that’s exactly what happened when the first 246 families moved out of the slums and into the newly created Kaputiei town with nearly 1,800 families to follow. For the same monthly mortgage they had paid for their one-room shacks, each family now lives in a home with two bedrooms, a bath, a kitchen and a living room. But this is ultra sub-prime lending that works because in order to qualify for a mortgage the residents have to have successfully repaid three micro-business loans.

Where does Munro’s capacity to innovate and defy conventional wisdom in the microfinance field come from? It started 20 years ago when she and her husband adopted three street children. It was in the fertile ground of Munro’s relationship with the mothers of her sons’ friends in the streets—women who were beggars— that her profound insights would grow. When Munro, a Swedish trained architect and urban planner, retired from the African Housing Fund in 1999, she thought she would also retire from the little group of 50 beggar women with whom she had been working. But when the women pled with her not leave them, Munro agreed to stay and insisted that they must lift themselves out of poverty. For Munro that meant the women had to start developing the discipline of saving on a regular basis.

She had them come every Saturday with about 50 cents in savings. When they deposited their 50 cents she would give each of them two scoops of corn and one scoop of beans for free. She admits now that for those first two months she was tricking them into saving with the lure of free corn and beans. After two months, the bags were empty, but the beggars continued to save and the free corn and beans never returned.

Another of Munro’s breakthroughs is that all Jamii Bora staff are former members, previously destitute themselves.

Winning the war against poverty won’t come from summoning the right “final answers” to a handful of trivia questions to strike it rich on a game show. Winning the war against global poverty will come when we realize that we have one of the answers—microcredit—and summon the political will to lift up those microcredit programs that have figured out how to reach the world’s most destitute people. This is a final answer we can stand behind.

"Successful communication hinges on keeping track of who and what we are talking about. For this reason, person reference sits at the heart of the social sciences. Referring to persons is an interactional process where information is transferred from current speakers to the recipients of their talk. This dissertation concerns itself with the work that is achieved through this transfer of information.

The interactional approach adopted is one that combines the ""micro"" of conversation analysis with the 'macro' of genealogically grounded anthropological linguistics. Murriny Patha, a non-Pama-Nyungan language spoken in the north of Australia, is a highly complex polysynthetic language with kinship categories that are grammaticalized as verbal inflections. For referring to persons, as well as names, nicknames, kinterms, minimal descriptions and free pronouns, Murriny Patha speakers make extensive use of pronominal reference markers embedded within polysynthetic verbs. Murriny Patha does not have a formal 'mother-in-law' register. There are however numerous taboos on naming kin in avoidance relationships, and on naming and their namesakes. Similarly, there are also taboos on naming the deceased and on naming their namesakes. As a result, for every speaker there is a multitude of people whose names should be avoided.

At any one time, speakers of the language have a range of referential options. Speakers' decisions about which category of reference forms to choose (names, kinterms etc.) are governed by conversational preferences that shape 'referential design'. Six preferences - a preference for associating the referent to the co-present conversationalists, a preference for avoiding personal names, a preference for using recognitionals, a preference for being succinct, and a pair of opposed preferences relating to referential specificity - guide speakers towards choosing a name on one occasion, a kinterm on the next occasion and verbal cross-reference on yet another occasion. Different classes of expressions better satisfy particular conversational preferences. There is a systematicity to the referential choices that speakers make. The interactional objectives of interlocutors are enacted through the regular placement of particular forms in particular sequential environments. These objectives are then revealed through the turn-by-turn unfolding of conversational interaction.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Las Vegas - Mercedes-Benz has
created an unconventional presentation idea under the heading
“Tuner Challenge”. Ahead of the equally unconventional SEMA Show
in the gaming hotspot of Las Vegas, the Stuttgart company
announced a competition for tuning firms. The object of desire –
the compact GLK-Class. The distinctively styled automotive
character with an edge seems predestined to arouse a wide range
of tuning fantasies.

Tuning operations were tasked with
highlighting the possibilities presented by the GLK’s
wide-ranging talents through their ideas and designs. The four
most convincing concepts were selected and the winners given the
opportunity to implement their proposals. This process saw the
creation of GLK models that are as leading-edge as they are
unorthodox, and that now take centre stage in Mercedes’
participation at this year’s SEMA Show.

“Our GLK is a character bursting
with expressiveness, and a new model for us within a young
market segment in the U.S.,” comments Mercedes-Benz Head of
Design Gorden Wagener. “We selected SEMA in Las Vegas as the
backdrop for its first appearance in North America because we
want to take advantage of the show’s glamour and to underscore
the highly individual character of the GLK. An SUV with an edge
that is so refreshingly alternative, demands a somewhat
alternative setting.”

“Widestar”, “The GLK Urban Whip”,
“The GLK Pikes Peak Rally Racer” and “The GLK Rock Crawler” will
attract attention even at SEMA, which is not exactly short on
highlights and is becoming increasingly important as a
trendsetting springboard for the European tuning scene. This
presentation also represents the GLK premiere on the North
American market, where sales are scheduled to begin in January
2009.

Good market prospects are being forecast
for the compact GLK in the U.S. The visual appeal and functionality of
its exterior design make the GLK a distinctive and versatile vehicle, as
do its exceptional handling and excellent safety characteristics
combined with superb comfort both on and off-road.

GLK-Class freely interpreted four times

Four fundamentally different rebuilds make
one thing abundantly clear – the GLK-Class is one of the most
multi-faceted SUV models ever, and one that retains its distinctive
character, even in the face of somewhat unconventional modifications.
With each respective tuner fantasy and the help of some exotic
ingredients, the SUV has been turned into an exclusive specialist for
the road, beach, city or rally stage. “We wanted to see what kinds of
interpretations were inspired by our GLK and how they would further
sharpen this very strong character. The tuners opted for completely
differing approaches, demonstrating the potential of our GLK concept,”
continues Gorden Wagener.

With its GLK Pikes Peak Rally Racer,
RENNtech from Lake Park, Florida has created a motorsport vehicle
inspired by the unlimited class of the legendary Pikes Peak Hill Climb
in Colorado. The drivetrain of the RENNtech GLK is complemented by a
hybrid module that guarantees excellent acceleration figures.

BRABUS, based in Bottrop, Germany,
represents the German element of this tuning fraternity and presents the
Widestar, a production-ready, high-performance on-road vehicle that also
pays tribute to the distinctive refinement of vehicles bearing the
three-pointed star.

GLK Urban Whip is the name given by
Boulevard Customs from St. Petersburg, Florida to its creation, which
makes its entrance with a significantly widened bodyshell, massive 26
inch wheels and a mighty on-board entertainment system that, according
to the figures, is likely to have an impact at full blast of
seismological proportions.

The team at the Legendary Motorcar Company
from Ontario, Canada, which is more commonly associated with the
restoration of American muscle cars, created The GLK Rock Crawler. The
exotic design for snow and sand includes a winch system that can provide
wakeboarders and snowboarders alike with the necessary impetus.

The base vehicle for Boulevard Customs,
Legendary Motorcar and RENNtech is the series production GLK350 with a
3.5 litre V6 engine generating 200 kW/272 hp, while BRABUS opted for the
diesel-driven GLK 320 CDI 4MATIC. The base versions of all models are
equipped with the 7G-TRONIC seven-speed automatic transmission.

Show vehicles with public voting

Mercedes-Benz is combining a voting
program for the North American public with its appearances at SEMA and
the subsequent Los Angeles Motor Show, where the customized GLKs will
also be presented. At either show, or in the internet at www.mbusa.com,
visitors can cast their vote for their favourite model. The winner of
the “Tuner Challenge” will be announced on 2nd December.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Sleep Apnea

Sleep Apnea
In people who have sleep apnea (also referred to as sleep-disordered breathing), breathing briefly stops or becomes very shallow during sleep. This change is caused by intermittent blocking of the upper airway, usually when the soft tissue in the rear of the throat collapses and partially or completely closes the airway. Each breathing stop typically lasts 10 - 20 seconds or more and may occur 20 - 30 times or more each sleeping hour.

“I have sleep apnea. In the past, I used to arrange my schedule around whether I’ve had enough sleep. Now I don’t worry about that.

Starting on continuous positive airway pressure and medication have changed my life - now I’m excited to wake up and face each day after a night of restful sleep.”ANNE COLLINS

If you have sleep apnea, not enough air can flow into your lungs through the mouth and nose during sleep, even though breathing efforts continue. When this happens, the amount of oxygen in your blood decreases. Your brain responds by awakening you enough to tighten the upper airway muscles and open your windpipe. Normal breaths then start again, often with a loud snort or choking sound.

Although people who have sleep apnea typically snore loudly and frequently, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea. (See “Is Snoring a Problem?”)

Because people who have sleep apnea frequently arouse from deeper sleep stages to lighter sleep during the night, they rarely spend enough time in deep, restorative stages of sleep. They are therefore often excessively sleepy during the day. Such sleepiness is thought to lead to mood and behavior problems, including depression, and such sleepiness more than triples the risk of being in a traffic or workrelated accident.

The many brief drops in blood-oxygen levels can be associated with morning headaches and decreased ability to concentrate, think properly, learn, and remember. In sleep apnea, the combination of the intermittent oxygen drops and reduced sleep quality triggers the release of stress hormones. These hormones in turn raise your blood pressure and heart rate and boost the risk of heart attack, stroke, irregular heart beats, and congestive heart failure. In addition, untreated sleep apnea can lead to altered energy metabolism that increases the risk for developing obesity and diabetes.

Anyone can have sleep apnea. It is estimated that at least 12 - 18 million American adults have sleep apnea, making it as common as asthma. More than one-half of the people who have sleep apnea are overweight. Sleep apnea is more common in men. More than 1 in 25 middle-aged men and 1 in 50 middle-aged women have sleep apnea along with excessive daytime sleepiness. About 3 percent of children and 10 percent or more of people over age 65 have sleep apnea. This condition occurs more frequently in African Americans, Asians, Native Americans, and Hispanics than in Caucasians.

More than one-half of all people who have sleep apnea are not diagnosed. People who have sleep apnea generally are not aware that their breathing stops in the night. They just notice that they don’t feel well rested when they wake up and are sleepy throughout the day. Their bed partners are likely to notice, however, that they snore loudly and frequently and that they often stop breathing briefly while sleeping. Doctors suspect sleep apnea if these symptoms are present, but the diagnosis must be confirmed with overnight sleep monitoring. (See “How Are Sleep Disorders Diagnosed?”) This monitoring will reveal pauses in breathing, frequent sleep arousals, and intermittent drops in levels of oxygen in the blood.

Like adults who have sleep apnea, children who have this disorder usually snore loudly, snort or gasp, and have brief stops in breathing while sleeping. Small children often have enlarged tonsils and adenoids that increase their risk for sleep apnea. But doctors may not suspect sleep apnea in children because, instead of showing the typical signs of sleepiness during the day, these children often become agitated and may be considered hyperactive. The effects of sleep apnea in children may include diminished school performance and difficult, aggressive behavior.

It's easy to make a financial decision based on what you need right now, but making an informed choice will benefit you in the long run. Meet a former Red Sox pitcher who picked security over an uncertain future",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Can Dehydration Affect Creatinine Level in Blood

2014-09-09 18:13

Creatinine level is one of the indicator of kidney disease, it can reflect the degrees of kidney damaged, but high creatinine level not always means kidney damage, there are many factors may affect the creatinine level, such as high fever and cold. Then can dehydration affect creatinine levels in blood ? If you want to know it directly, you can chat with our online doctor now.

Dehydration is one of the symptoms of Chronic Kidney Disease, just like weakness, swelling. It can reflect your kidney has been damaged in some degree but it will not affect the creatinine level in blood for a long time. In the following i will share you some reasons which can increase the level of it. There are two main reasons, they are non-disease factors and pathological factors. Non-disease factors including high fever, cold and eat too much foods with high protein in a short time. After eliminate those factors, you can make sure your kidney has been damaged. Serum creatinine level can reflect the damaged degrees of kidney, but it is not the sensitive indicator, only after the GFR declined to 50% the level of creatinine will increase. That is mean when your creatinine level is higher that the normal level and accompanied with other symptoms such as vomit, nausea, dizzy.

From the above we know that dehydration is a kind of symptoms of kidney disease just like vomit,so it will not affect the creatinine level in blood for a long time. If your creatinine level is higher than the normal level, at the same time, occurred dehydration, that means there are something wrong in your kidney.

"Marvel VS Marvel: The MCU Films, Second Only to Their Television Counterparts

With Captain America: Civil War dominating the box office and raking in a nauseating amount of money for Marvel and its parent-company Disney, it’s clear that the superhero genre is one that people won’t be tiring of anytime soon. Since 2008’s Iron Man, Marvel has had success after success with its ever-expanding film franchises as new and old fans flock to the theaters to see their favorite heroes battle with a seemingly endless list of foes. While DC, Marvel’s main competitor, has also begun to crank out these beloved hero flicks, they’ve yet to meet the quality and quantity of Marvel films.

Marvel has been releasing at least two films per year, with its Phase 3 schedule extending into 2020, and, perhaps most importantly, the company has been releasing at least two successful films per year. The company has yet to have a flop on its hands, due large in part to the fact that the, “It’s all connected,” motto links each of the standalones to the larger ensemble flicks in one way or another. Critics as well as fans have continued to sing Marvel praises, making it clear that the company is certainly #1 in the superhero franchise game.

Despite being at the top of the field (the alleged showdown between Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Captain America: Civil War unsurprisingly ended with the latter winning in the eyes of critics and audiences alike) there is one thing that the MCU has almost embarrassingly dropped the ball on: diversity.

Gender diversity. Racial diversity. Diversity in nearly every regard.

With Captain America: Civil War (the twelfth MCU film since Iron Man) Marvel has managed to increase the number of its central black characters to a whopping three.

THREE.

Let’s give a slow-clap to Marvel for providing as many African American actors as white Chrises.

That was sarcasm by the way. Don’t clap for that. Do you realize how absurd it is that if another Chris joins the MCU the white Chrises will outnumber the non-white subsidiary leads?

Until Civil War the Chrises did outnumber the non-white members of the ensemble cast!

That coupled with the fact that, until Black Panther hits theaters in 2018, there won’t be a non-white lead in the MCU is further indicative of Marvel’s glaringly evident lack of ethnic diversity.

Similarly, the lack of women in the MCU is a bit disappointing considering the women that are present are almost universally beloved and, let’s be honest, tend to kick more physical and intellectual ass than their male counterparts.

I mean, sure, Ant-Man was a fun movie, but are you honestly telling me you’d rather team up with Scott Lange over Natasha Romanoff? If your company is failing will you really call up the face of Stark Industries, or Pepper Potts, the one running it? If you’re in a tense situation, do you really want to call on the Hulk for back-up over Scarlet Witch?

No!

And yet, there have been zero standalone films centered around a female hero. (Point for DC and Wonder Woman)

With women making up over 50% of the world’s population, it seems patently ridiculous that we still only have two women, “worthy,” enough to be deemed Avengers.

Lucky for Marvel, its television shows are picking up the MCU’s slack.

While a Black Widow standalone is still seemingly a pipe dream, and the Captain Marvel film has already been pushed back in favor of another male-led flick, shows like AKA: Jessica Jones, Agent Carter, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. are putting women and non-white characters in the forefront.

Agent Carter has gotten a bit more flak for its diversity than some of the other Marvel shows, due large in part to the fact that the show is trying to emphasize how prevalent this issue was during the time period that Margaret Carter was fighting off discrimination as frequently as bad guys. In terms of racial diversity, the show still isn’t quite up to par, but its 1940’s setting likely makes it a bit difficult to integrate non-white characters in an appropriate and respectful manner. The setting isn’t really a great excuse, something that the Agent Carter writers likely picked up on considering Season 2 introduced Jason Wilkes as a certifiable genius. Peggy Carter is clearly a female role model, who proves time and time again that she is just as capable, if not more so, than many of the men she is forced to deal with in the SSR.

While the male to female ratio of Agent Carter isn’t necessarily as progressive as it perhaps should be, that’s kind of the point. Peggy is fighting sexism and striving to prove that she is an agent, full stop. She isn’t a female agent, she’s just an agent. She can fight with the best of them, banter with the lot of them, and tends to save the day more than any of them. And while there may be less women in Agent Carter than shows taking place in present-day, the women who are present are as far from, “damsel in distress,” as they come. We’ve seen Black Widows, cunning geniuses, and sharp-witted actresses who easily fool men without blinking an eye. Agent Carter does a tremendous job of ensuring that all women portrayed in the show are as strong, intelligent, and funny as the gender is in real life.

Jessica Jones, a show whose titular character is in fact a woman, is coming off a recent Peabody win and has received praise across the board for its depiction of a strong, independent, and capable individual. AKA: a woman. The show doesn’t glamorize Jessica in any way. It doesn’t try to put her on a pedestal for men to lust after and women to emulate. Jessica Jones simply takes a character who has endured more hardships than most, and shows you how she is struggling to deal with them. There are consequences and repercussions, good decisions and bad, and, most importantly, there is a woman at the center of them all who is trying to navigate them as best she can. Equally important to note is the fact that the most important person in Jessica’s life is not a boyfriend but a best friend. There’s no dude coming in to save the day and rescue Jessica from Kilgrave. Sure, a couple of guys try, but in the end it’s the bond between women that gives our hero her victory. IMDb’s, “Top Series Cast,” spots go first to Krysten Ritter, second to Rachael Taylor, and third to Eka Darville.

Not a Caucasian dude in the lot.

Better yet? Jessica Jones introduced us to Luke Cage, whose show is set to air in 2017… a full year before Black Panther hits screens.

And now we reach the crowning glory of diversity in Marvel television.

Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is, from what I can see, inarguably the most progressive of the Marvel productions.

While everyone has been giving S.H.I.E.L.D. grief for not being more like the movies, it should be pointed out that the show is actually surpassing the movies where diversity is concerned. All of the people who gave up on the show in Season 1 because they were (for one reason or another) expecting a show called Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to be rife with Avengers cameos, in addition to failing to grasp the actual premise, failed to realize that the characters on S.H.I.E.L.D. are infinitely more reflective of a world comprised of more than white men.

The much talked about Secret Warriors were introduced not long ago and were evenly represented by characters of Chinese/American, American, Colombian, and Mexican origin (the actors portraying said characters are Chinese/American, Australian, Colombian, and Mexican). Compare that to the two of twelve central characters in Civil War who aren’t Caucasian and it makes Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. the clear victor in terms of diversity. In fact, not only are multiple ethnicities celebrated, S.H.I.E.L.D. actually makes a point of calling out its own characters when they become a little too Western. When Daisy somewhat irritably requests that the foreign members of her team speak in English, Elena immediately replies, “Aren’t you a spy? Learn Spanish.”

It’s such an eye-opening moment because, yeah Daisy, you are a spy and you should learn some Spanish. (Perhaps a little Russian as well?) English is not the majority language of the world and S.H.I.E.L.D. reminds viewers of that fact in a very real and self-aware way.

Couple the focus on varying ethnicities with the fact that half of this new team of Inhumans is comprised of women, and the actual leader of said team is agent-extraordinaire Daisy Johnson, and the Secret Warriors are already 100% more diverse than their Avengers counterparts.

Best yet? At no point in the show is it even questioned that these women are just as capable, and oftentimes more capable, than the men. Joey, Elena, and Lincoln follow Daisy because she is a leader. Period. She has the most experience with S.H.I.E.L.D, has gone on more missions than anyone else on the Inhuman team, and is in the best position to make the tough calls. Everyone else knows this and are competent enough to realize that those facts are the only ones that matter.

And this isn’t something that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. has just started emphasizing.

Since it first premiered, S.H.I.E.L.D. has been a show centered around an even number of male and female characters, with a third of the core 6 characters being of Asian descent. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t as cookie cutter as the Marvel films and strives to put all characters on a relatively even playing field regardless of race or gender. There are some men who are forces to be reckoned with in the field, and others who much prefer being in a lab. And it’s exactly the same situation for the women of the show. The skillset of some lies in dissecting dead bodies, while the skillset of others involves punching baddies in the face. In fact, until recently, the vast majority of the stunt-work on the show has been done by its female field-agents.

Lastly, while I’ve read many an article about the lack of diversity in Hollywood, and particularly in the superhero genre, I’ve not seen much on the topic of disabilities. While the MCU briefly touched upon Tony Stark’s post-Battle of New York PTSD, Hawkeye’s hearing impairment is still noticeably absent, as are many of the more obvious issues that Bucky has faced as a result of his role as the Winter Soldier. Sure, there are some subtle hints and a few brief mentions, but, for the most part, the issue that plague the characters in the MCU are often overlooked or perceived through subtext by observant viewers.

Cut back to Marvel’s television franchises and you see a wide spectrum of very real issues being openly discussed and highlighted. Jessica Jones focuses on a woman who was mentally and physically abused to the point where she developed paranoia, severe depression, and less-than-advisable coping mechanisms. Daredevil focuses on a man, blinded as a child, who used every resource in his possession to train himself to become the protector of Hell’s Kitchen. Agent Carter is a show that, at its heart, focuses on a war vet who is slowly but surely readjusting to life and doing her utmost to take things one day at a time.

And Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D?

Leo Fitz suffered from severe brain damage post-Season 1, Melinda May has been dealing with PTSD since the start of the series due to the incident in Bahrain, Phil Coulson has experienced PTSD since his resurrection as well as the physical loss of a limb, Jemma Simmons has had clear signs of PTSD, depression, and anxiety since returning from her involuntary trip to alien planet Maveth, Daisy Johnson has had to deal with the mental and emotional challenges of physical transforming into an Inhuman, and Grant Ward, though certainly a villain, is another character whose abuse led him down a terrible path. And those are just original characters! Lincoln is a recovering alcoholic, Bobbi underwent psych evals and physical therapy after her run-in with Ward, and (prior to becoming and Inhuman-murdering psycho) Andrew Garner was visible enough to indicate that all Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. were being evaluated in some way.

S.H.I.E.L.D. has done better than most at not shying away from the reality of an unrealistic show. As black-ops agents, these characters will undoubtedly experience things that will permanently change them forever. But, rather than completely dismissing such changes, S.H.I.E.L.D. does what it can in the allotted time-frame to address them. We’ve seen legitimate therapy sessions, both physical and mental, and have at no point been forced to believe that everyone is perfect and A-ok.

So far, the MCU has been very much, “One step forward, two steps back,” while approaching this problem of diversity. Yay for a Black Panther film with Chadwick Boseman starring, boo that in a sea of white-male-driven films it was Captain Marvelthat got pushed back to make it happen.

The MCU is essentially a web of carefully implemented films that can be linked together in order to provide some semblance of congruity. And while the films themselves connect fairly seamlessly, they unfortunately do not connect with many of the audiences that are viewing them. It’s hard to remember in places like the United States, where companies like Marvel and Disney are based out of, that white men do not make up the majority of the world and are therefore not the only people who should be represented in these film franchises. There are far larger markets that, for some odd reason, are inaccurately being considered the minority simply because their skin color or gender isn’t what Hollywood and the Western culture have deemed worthy of being reflected onscreen.

Considering the next 4+ years of Marvel films have already been planned and scheduled, it seems pretty unlikely that the MCU will make any significant improvements in diversifying the characters it chooses to portray onscreen.

Until then, we thankfully have equally exciting, character-driven, action-packed, shows to watch instead.

Amicus Therapeutics Provides Full-Year 2019 Strategic Outlook and Financial Guidance Full-Year 2018 Galafold Revenue of ~$91M Exceeds $80M-$90M Guidance 2019 Galafold Revenue Expected to Nearly Double – with Guidance of $160M-$180M Pompe Phase 3 PROPEL Study Expected to Complete Enrollment and Additional Phase 2 Pompe Data in 2019 Additional 2-Year Data from Phase 1/2 CLN6 Batten Disease Clinical Study Anticipated Mid-Year 2019 Ongoing Phase 1/2 CLN3 Batten Disease Study Expected to Complete Enrollment in 2019 Preclinical Proof of Concept for Fabry and Pompe Gene Therapy Programs Expected in 2019 Strong Balance Sheet with $500M+ Cash CRANBURY, NJ, January 7, 2019 – Amicus Therapeutics (Nasdaq: FOLD), a global biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing and delivering novel medicines for rare metabolic diseases, today provided unaudited preliminary Galafold revenue for the full-year 2018 and introduced its full-year 2019 strategic outlook and financial guidance. During 2018 Amicus met or exceeded all five key strategic priorities: • More than doubled global revenue for Galafold (migalastat). Revenue grew from $36.9 million in full-year 2017 to approximately $91 million (preliminary and unaudited) in full-year 2018, exceeding the high end of the full-year 2018 guidance range of $80 million to $90 million. • Successfully secured approvals for migalastat in the U.S. and Japan, with strong initial adoption. As of December 31, 2018, 149 patients in the U.S. have been prescribed Galafold since the August launch. • Achieved clinical, manufacturing and regulatory milestones to advance AT-GAA toward global regulatory submissions and approvals. Highlights included positive 12- and 18-month data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study, manufacturing scale up (1000L), and first patient dosed in the PROPEL pivotal study. • Pipeline expanded to include 14 new gene therapy programs, including two clinical programs in Batten disease, exceeding target of least one new clinical program in 2019. Target enrollment has been achieved in the Phase 1/2 study in CLN6 Batten disease, and the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 1/2 study in CLN3 Batten disease. • Maintained and strengthened the balance sheet. The current cash position of approximately $505 million (preliminary and unaudited) at December 31, 2018 is expected to fund ongoing operations into at least mid-2021. John F. Crowley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. stated, “During 2018 we advanced several steps closer to our 2023 vision to treat at least 5,000 patients and achieve $1 billion in global revenue. Following the new approvals for our Fabry precision medicine Galafold in the U.S. and Japan, and continued growth momentum in international markets, we have exceeded our 2018 guidance. Patients are also now being treated in multiple Amicus clinical studies, including our Phase 1/2 and pivotal studies of AT-GAA for Pompe disease, as well as Phase 1/2 studies of our investigational gene therapies for CLN3 and CLN6 Batten disease. Today we are in a stronger position than ever to become a leading global biotechnology company focused on transforming the lives of people living with these rare, life-threatening conditions and creating significant value for our shareholders.” Amicus is focused on the following five key strategic priorities in 2019:

• Nearly double again annual revenue for Galafold (FY19 guidance of $160M-$180M in worldwide revenue) with 1,000+ Fabry patients on Galafold by year end • Complete enrollment in pivotal study in Pompe disease and report additional Phase 2 data • Report additional two-year results from Phase 1/2 clinical study in CLN6 Batten disease and complete enrollment in ongoing CLN-3 Batten disease Phase 1/2 study • Establish preclinical proof of concept for Fabry and Pompe gene therapies • Maintain a strong financial position Mr. Crowley will discuss Amicus' corporate objectives and key milestones in a presentation at the 37th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference on Tuesday, January 8, 2019 at 8:30 a.m. PT (11:30 a.m. ET). A live webcast of the presentation can be accessed through the Investors section of the Amicus Therapeutics corporate web site at http://ir.amicusrx.com/events.cfm, and will be archived for 90 days. Full-Year 2018 Financial Summary and 2019 Guidance Amicus recorded approximately $91 million (preliminary and unaudited) in full-year 2018 revenue from commercial sales and reimbursed expanded access programs for Galafold. For the full-year 2019 the Company anticipates total Galafold revenue of $160 million to $180 million. Prescription growth in 2018 was largely driven by EU and other countries outside the U.S. and Japan. Growth in 2019 is expected to be driven by continued growth in EU markets, further geographic expansion, and further success from the first full year of launch in the U.S. and Japan. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled just over $500 million (preliminary and unaudited) at December 31, 2018. The Company expects to end 2019 with approximately $300 million in cash on hand. The current cash position is anticipated to fund ongoing operations into at least mid- 2021. Program Highlights Galafold (Migalastat) Oral Precision Medicine for Fabry Disease Galafold is an oral precision medicine for Fabry disease approved in the EU and other geographies to treat Fabry disease in patients 16 years or older who have amenable genetic mutations. The U.S. FDA approved Galafold under Subpart H for the treatment of adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease and an amenable genetic variant. An estimated 35% to 50% of the global Fabry population may be suitable for treatment with Galafold on the basis of their genetic mutations, or variants. For patients who are not suitable for treatment with Galafold on the basis of their genetic mutations, or variants, Amicus is advancing a next-generation gene therapy. Global Galafold Updates: • 650+ patients (naïve and ERT-switch) on reimbursed Galafold worldwide as of December 31, 2018. • Approvals secured in eight geographies including Australia, Canada, EU, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and United States and pending in Taiwan and several additional markets. • U.S. launch exceeded internal expectations with 149 new patient prescriptions, also known as patient referral forms (PRFs), as of December 31, 2018. Time to shipment was up to 60 days, limiting 2018 revenue impact but providing a strong foundation for 2019. • Pricing and reimbursement secured in 24 countries. • Registry and other Phase 4 supportive studies underway. AT-GAA for Pompe Disease AT-GAA is a novel treatment paradigm in Phase 3 development that consists of ATB200, a unique recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) enzyme with optimized carbohydrate structures, particularly mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), to enhance uptake, co-administered with AT2221, a pharmacological chaperone. Positive results from a global Phase 1/2 clinical study (ATB200-02) have shown consistent and durable responses across key measures of safety, functional outcomes and biomarkers in both ERT-switch and ERT-naïve Pompe patients following up to 18 months of treatment with AT-GAA. The Company’s strategy is to enhance the body of clinical data for AT-GAA in ongoing clinical studies, including the pivotal study (PROPEL, also referred to as ATB200-03) to deliver this potential new therapy to as many people living with Pompe disease as soon as possible. Based on regulatory feedback from both the U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA), the PROPEL study is expected to support approval for a broad indication, including ERT-switch and treatment-naïve patients.

Pompe Program Updates: • 1000L scale material released for pivotal PROPEL study. • Dosing initiated in PROPEL study. • WuXi partnership strengthened with 5-year supply agreement. Anticipated Pompe Program Milestones in 2019: • New data from the Phase 1/2 ATB200-02 clinical study, including final 24-month data in Cohorts 1-3, and initial 6- month data in additional ERT-switch patients (Cohort 4). • Retrospective natural history study data in approximately 100 ERT-treated Pompe patients. • Additional supportive studies, including an open-label study in pediatric patients. • Full enrollment in Phase 3 PROPEL study. • Advance agreed upon CMC requirements to support BLA. Gene Therapy Programs for Rare Metabolic Diseases During the third quarter and early fourth quarter of 2018, Amicus expanded its pipeline and future growth platform [link here] to include 14 new gene therapy programs and future growth platform for rare metabolic diseases, including 10 preclinical and clinical stage adeno associated virus 9 (AAV9) programs (intrathecal delivery) for neurologic lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs). Together these 10 programs have the potential to address 10,000+ people living with these neurologic LSDs and represent a $1 billion recurring revenue opportunity. Amicus is also developing four next-generation AAV gene therapies for Fabry disease, Pompe disease, CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) and one additional undisclosed rare metabolic disorder. In Batten disease, compelling proof of concept has been demonstrated in preclinical studies in CLN6, CLN3, and CLN8, as well as initial clinical safety and efficacy in a Phase 1/2 study in patients with CLN6. The Company has also shown early proof of principle for Amicus DNA constructs for optimized gene therapies for Fabry and Pompe diseases. Gene Therapy Program Updates: • First patient treated in CLN3 Batten disease Phase 1/2 study with no serious adverse events reported to date. • Target enrollment achieved in CLN6 Batten disease Phase 1/2 study, with 12 patients receiving a single administration of gene therapy (exposure ranging from ~1 to 34 months). Anticipated Gene Therapy Pipeline Milestones in 2019: • Additional two-year data from CLN6 Batten disease Phase 1/2 study. • Full enrollment of ongoing CLN3 Batten disease Phase 1/2 study. • Preclinical data for next-generation gene therapies for Fabry, Pompe and CDD. • Preclinical work across additional neurologic LSDs. About Galafold Galafold® (migalastat) 123 mg capsules is an oral pharmacological chaperone of alpha-Galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) for the treatment of Fabry disease in adults who have amenable GLA variants.

"Morocco Replaces Turkey as New Co-chair of GCTF | MAP

Morocco, already a global leader in the fight against violent extremism, is taking over the co-presidency of the Global Counter Terrorism Forum (GCTF):

The transfer of the co-presidency of the Global Counter Terrorism Forum (GCTF) from Turkey to Morocco took place here on Wednesday on the occasion of the 9th meeting of the GCTF’s coordination committee.

Morocco and Netherlands will co-chair the GCTF replacing Turkey and the US.

Speaking on this occasion, Minister Delegate to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Nasser Bourita said that the Moroccan-Dutch co-presidency is the culmination of a fruitful collaboration through the Working Group on foreign terrorist fighters.

”Assuming this responsibility shows the clear, determined and constructive involvement of Morocco in the fight against terrorism,” he added, noting that the Kingdom is set to strengthen the values of openness, dialogue, cooperation and sharing of experiences and good practices.

Bourita highlighted efforts made by Morocco at the working group on foreign terrorist fighters and within the joint initiative with the US on border security.

The Dutch foreign minister, Bert Koenders, said that the recent terror attacks, including the ones targeting Ankara, Istanbul, Lahore and Brussels, require the strengthening of counter-terrorism efforts.

Koenders stressed, in this context, the importance of strengthening the exchange of information in the prospect of establishing a long-term approach including prevention of radicalization.

Anthropogenic habitat modifications don't scare off marsh harriers

Over the past several decades, a growing number of studies have linked declines in biodiversity and abundance--especially of birds--with intensification of agricultural practices. Replacement of uncultivated areas with farm fields, use of pesticides, increases in monocultures, and earlier harvesting dates have all been associated with reductions in the quality of hunting/nesting habitats, reproductive failure, mortality of individual birds, and increased heterogeneity of bird communities.

However, as has been discussed in previous posts, not all animals respond to anthropogenic disturbance in the same way. Thus, it is likely that some species might not be negatively impacted by agricultural practices--in fact, they might benefit from them. For instance, species that depend on wetlands might thrive in agricultural areas where the use of irrigation has created artificial ponds and wetlands that either generate new habitats or replace those that were previously lost to agricultural expansion.

(Hunting marsh harrier, Circus aeruginosus)

This appears to be the case among marsh harriers (Circus aeruginosus) in the Catalan Ebro basin, an agricultural area in the Iberian Peninsula. The harriers declined in Europe between 1960 and 1980 because of pesticide contamination, hunting, and heavy drainage of the wetlands where they breed. Harrier populations have been recovering in recent decades, to the point where they are actually increasing their geographic range in some locations. These improvements appear to be linked with the birds' use of artificial ponds/reservoirs created by local farmers.

(Map outlining the Ebro Basin area of the Iberian Peninsula. Traditionally, agriculture here included extensive cultivation of cereal crops separated by field margins; fallow grounds were allowed to rest for one or more years, during which time they were used for grazing of livestock. During the 20th century, however, farming practices changed: A variety of alternative crops became popular, irrigation systems were established, and both the fallow system and field margins were eliminated. Currently, the region is an ""agricultural mosaic"" composed of arable, non-irrigated cereal crops, irrigated fields, dry fruit trees, and irrigated fruit trees.)

To investigate this hypothesis, researchers from the Universitat de Barcelona, the Estación Biológica de Doñana, and the Universidad Pablo de Olavide monitored breeding marsh harriers from 1997-2008 and measured habitat variables within and around wetlands where the birds were found nesting. Parameters of interest included type of habitat (e.g., artificial pond vs. reservoir vs. river, etc.), amount of vegetation in the wetland, shape of the wetland, amount of open water, type of agriculture associated with the wetland, and proximity to anthropogenic structures such as villages and roads.

Of the 617 total wetlands in the study area, only 51 had the minimum requirements that made them suitable for marsh harrier breeding. Of these, 68% were artificial water bodies associated with agricultural irrigation. Approximately 69% of these wetlands were occupied at least once during the study.

(Marsh harrier in flight)

Features of both the immediate (within-wetland) and extended (within a 3-km radius of the wetland) environment were associated with chosen breeding territories: Marsh harriers seemed to strongly prefer habitats with higher areas of aquatic vegetation; they were also drawn to wetlands near agricultural fields with highly irrigated herbaceous crops. The importance of these two levels of habitat features--both near to, and far from, the nesting site--suggests that the birds are satisfied not only with the apparent safety of the breeding ground, but also with the likelihood that they will find sufficient prey in the nearby fields. The fact that they are particularly drawn towards heavily managed cropland indicates that the birds are not being scared off by anthropogenic activities. Even better, the researchers did not find any relationship between habitat attributes and productivity. In other words, harriers in agricultural areas are not suffering reduced breeding success because of their fondness for artificial wetlands.

The scientists suggest that one of the reasons harriers may thrive in anthropogenic areas is the constant wetness due to influx of water from irrigation; in natural environments, wetlands often dry out during spring and summer because they are not continually supplied with fresh water. The authors also point out how the current results support previous findings suggesting that marsh harriers are able to find an abundance of prey in ""agriculturally intense"" habitats. However, neither study was able to document specifics related to harrier hunting practices, so more data will need to be collected--how far the birds fly, which areas of the habitat they use, what species they are eating--in order to explain the mechanisms behind their apparent success in anthropogenic areas.

Raptors such as the marsh harrier are often used as bioindicators--species whose population trends reflect the health of an ecosystem--because they are at the top of the food chain. This study shows that at least some raptors can adapt to the presence of humans; thus, this group of animals may not uniformly be good at providing early warnings of habitat degradation. However, the researchers point out that ""finer cues"" such as individual health and survival might indicate forms of ecosystem degradation that were not studied here--including water pollution and pesticide use. This is another possibility that will require attention in future studies.

Who is the ""Anthrophysist""?

I am a biologist who studies the ways in which anthropogenic disturbance impacts animals (especially birds). I hope that the results of my work, and the work of other researchers like me, can help humans learn how to coexist more peacefully with wildlife. I am also interested in the role that nature has played in shaping human cultures around the world and over the centuries. Although this blog will predominantly focus on scientific research, I hope to occasionally profile some anthropological work as well, in order to better highlight the interconnectedness of humans (""anthro"") and nature (""physis"").",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Malaysian Mandate of Heaven

Currently Ku Li is in a bit of an embarrassing strife because of an unsigned Stat Dec, but it won't matter much because I suspect Najib really doesn't give two figs about Ku Li being mentioned or involved in a document as an alternative PM, as he only wanted Ku Li's public declaration of support for him (a gimmickry as it has been) to show the Heartland that other than an unhappy unpleasant and unreasonable old man, everyone in UMNO supports his PM-ship.

In UMNO there's always all kinds of Machiavellian manoeuvres, all of which we can indeed assume to be surely Machiavellian wakakaka, and where the only difference is only in each's degree of intensity (the Machiavellian nature, that is), wakakaka again.

Ku Li had once tried to move democratically against UMNO Baru on a Semangat 46 platform but alas, he found out that fighting from outside against UMNO was near impossible. UMNO had/has the resources (very very deep pockets), the political infrastructure and network, control of the so-called apolitical (but very political) government institutions, and control of the media - it's only in recent times some media outlets have broken free of UMNO's control but this phenomenon may be short-lived.

Thus, more so for an UMNO man, erstwhile, former or ex, he or she must get back into UMNO to be able to ascend to where he wants to be, particularly if he/she aspires to be PM.

Would Mahathir have become PM if Razak (Najib's dad) didn't invite and accept him back?

Would AAB (previously aligned with Ku Li) have become PM if he didn't kuai kuai kowtow to Mahathir and return to the Mothership?

Thus Ku Li returns to UMNO, to wait and wait and wait for his chance to become PM. But he was both too cautious to take opportunistic chances and also too much of a proud aristocrat to kowtow kuai kuai to the demands and conditions of a commoner like Mahathir.

Yes, poor Ku Li was not as sly and as quietly kuai-laan as AAB and Najib who both acted as if they would 'tremblingly hear and obey' but gave Mahathir the two fingers once they become PM, wakakaka.

Alas, but it has to be said that AAB didn't fare too well in this regard though Najib seems to be resisting Mahathir's multiple attempts to dislodge him, wakakaka.

Anyway, there is no denying Ku Li has always wanted to be PM, which explains the SD the DAP has shown in an attempt to chip away and undermine the perceived support Ku Li has declared for Ah Jib Gor - see MM Online's Zahid can corroborate Ku Li’s role in SD, says DAP man.

However, this time I suspect Ku Li might have finally abandoned his 35 years' dream - one which sadly for him couldn't be realized only because he had foolishly given way to Mahathir as Hussein Onn's deputy because he had wanted to first sort out UMNO's financial business (Ku Li had the highest support compared to the other 2 UMNO VPs), and eventually as Malaysia's 4th PM, and only because he also foolishly believed Mahathir would keep his word to have him as DPM.

Sigh, he doesn't have the Mandate of Heaven, wakakaka.

Mandate of Heaven

In this regard, yes, we could say Mahathir had been treacherous to Ku Li in not keeping his words, an agreement to make the latter as his DPM as Ku Li had willingly given way to him to be deputy president UMNO and of course the PM, but then what do you expect when that's UMNO, a veritable nest of vipers.

Nonetheless, why has he (Mahathir) complained about AAB and Najib not keeping their word to him? Didn't he set the example vis-a-vis Ku Li for them to follow?Ain't karma such a bitch? Wakakaka.

But wait, I apologise for boring you with this sense of outrage at the blatant double standards because I kept forgetting that's UMNO, wakakaka.

And that's why, to reiterate, UMNO is a nest of vipers with mucho Machiavellian activities and schemes, wakakaka, which BTW should also include Anwar's attempted move against Mahathir back in 1998.

And to show my argument is true that UMNO blokes like Ku Li and Anwar (and indeed even Mahathir himself) prefer to be within UMNO than outside, let's see what Anwar did after he was out-manoeuvred by Mahathir following the failed attempt to oust the Old Man in June 1998.

OK, let's hear what he said just a mere two months later, on 12 August 1998, during the opening of the then-new Penang UMNO building. That was when the UMNO jungle drums were already beating away that Anwar was going for broke for the presidency of UMNO because of the virtually irreparable rift between the two UMNO top leaders, wakakaka. Anwar said:""I have said this many times, but it has all been for nought, but right here in front of my Penang friends, I want to announce my full support and loyalty to Datuk Seri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed for him to remain as party president.""

""Dr. Mahathir is not a new leader. He has vast experience in all matters. If you compare me to him, I am just a student. I can never go against my mentor, much less my father. We may have some differences but it is impossible to believe that these petty differences will split us up. When it comes to important matters, including economic issues, we stand united.""

Well, … mentor-student, vast experience in all matters and father-son ... what do we make of those sweet endearing words?

Hmmm, Anwar had said this of Mahathir during AAB's time when the latter was encountering mucho problemo with His Imperial Maharaja, wakakaka, that Mahathir was suffering from delusion about his stewardship of the country:

“He is surrounded by tok ampu (apple polishers) who never tell him the real picture. That is why he never gets the real truth. In that sense, I pity the man.”

Now, when Anwar lavished those sweet syrupy words of … mentor-student, vast experience in all matters and father-son ... for Mahathir on 12 August 1998, wasn't he also one of those tok ampu he complained surrounded Mahathir? Wakakaka.

And we all knew his tok ampu-ness' sweet honey-laced words cut no ice with an already furious fuming Mahathir.

Yes, Anwar knew the near insurmountable difficulties of becoming PM when outside UMNO, which was why he fought tooth and nail to get back into the Mothership, even unto suing Mahathir and the government in 1998 for unconstitutional dismissal of him from his DPM and Finance Minister's positions - my late Bhai was his lawyer. Utusan reported:

He also sought a declaration that his dismissal as from 5.30pm on Sept 2 1998 is null and void, inconsequential and of no effect.

Anwar, who is also seeking a declaration that he is still a minister in the cabinet, is also asking for cost and any further or other relief deemed fit and proper by the court.

But as I mentioned it's not easy to fight 'city hall' from outside for reasons listed above - naturally he lost and Mahathir triumphed over him once more in that court case.

But he still didn't give up because when he was released by AAB in 2006, we were told by a Malaysiakini news report on 10 August 2006 that he sought out Ku Li for advice on his political future.

This was what I had blogged a day after the Malaysiakini report:

Tengku Razaleigh (Ku Li) has confirmed what I have been averring all along – that Anwar Ibrahim yearns and plans to return to UMNO.

I had stated that once a person has experienced power at the very top, as Anwar Ibrahim had before he was ousted on the eve of his prime ministership, that person would find it extremely difficult to accept being at a lower political position, like say, a mere opposition leader.

And in Malaysia, there is only one avenue to the top of the political hierarchy, via UMNO, full stop!

After Anwar was released from prison, he went to see Ku Li. Ku Li advised him that there were only two parties for Anwar to reach the top, rejoin UMNO or join PAS to become its head and transform the Islamist party into a modern attractive and powerful alternative party. If he was able to achieve the latter he could even be the first PAS PM. Ku Li also advised him to stop mucking around with loser PKR.

But obviously UMNO is the easier path of the two. Ku Li said: “I advised him if you want to get back to mainstream politics, or want to be prime minister, you should go back to UMNO. How? He has to work it out. I am not to advise him [on that].""

Ku Li told Anwar: ""Your wife (Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail) only won because it was your (previous) seat in Permatang Pauh"".[recall in the 2004 GE how Wan Azizah scrapped through after a couple of recounts (losing in the first two counts), winning with 21,737 votes to UMNO Pirdaus Ismail's 21,147, a scary majority of only 590 votes which in practical terms translated into a win by only 296 votes - and that was what must have influenced Ku Li's words]

However, Ku Li told Malaysiakini he doubt whether Anwar will win if he (Anwar) were to stand again in Permatang Pauh - unless he stands on either PAS or UMNO ticket.

According to Ku Li, Anwar agreed to his advice.

But alas for him, he couldn't batter down the shut-very-tight UMNO gates, wakakaka, despite his attempts to charm AAB, on which I have a couple of posts, wakakaka.

Hmmm again, I wonder whether it was a coincidence that GAN (Gerakan Anti Najib) or as it's known today by its English acronym ANC, started around that time in which a poor and already dead Shaariibuu Altantuyaa was repetitively 'murdered' by Malaysian politics (extracts):

By sheer speed of their computation of advantage

What to extract, exploit, extricate from my name

Squeezing the very last speck of desiccated blood

From my hyper cold shattered fragments of bones

Eager hands raided the ossuary for me to be laid

As stepping stones for the progress of a demigod

On Ardha-Matanga, 4 tasks & seven white trunks

Saluting Brahma, walking to Amarawati by a lake

As the pseudo-pious pirouetting pachyderm crushesWhat little good left of my name, what trust existsIn my family’s hope for requital of my cruel murderI realize those raucous battle cries were not for me

Oh, what filial piety PKR had shown to Altantuyaa

Even in 2008 when Pakatan Rakyat was riding a political tsunami and performed its best, it was still short of 30 seats for a majority, testifying to the difficulties in (not impossibility of) dislodging a 50-year old established 'city hall'.

The BN's majority of 58 seats in 2008 (140 vs PR's 82) meant that Pakatan was short of 30 seats, a charming round figure, to depose BN from majority rule, but alas Anwar didn't couldn't wait until GE-13.

His impatience led to the shameful 916, a sickening best-forgotten attempt to subvert the supremacy of the ballot box, and an event which saw ONLY my Bhai speaking out angrily against the sleazy slimy sickening frog-ology-to-majority-rule, a trademark of tadpoles hatched in the cesspool.

But I wonder whether the new charming 'de facto' (wakakaka) PKR leader, will play the game that AAB and Ahmad Zahid Hamidi had played quite successfully?

We had the pleasure of participating in the FBAA National Industry conference in the last week of November. As always it’s an outstanding event bringing together an 800 strong mix of brokers, celebrities, gurus and experts. Here are our highlights.

Speakers

While we work in the finance industry there’s much we can learn from other industries and take back to our day jobs. Hearing from Allan Pease on the art of body language was an eye opener, Graeme Edwards from the Queensland Police showed us the importance of cyber security for while Adam Franklin showcased his guru credentials with a masterclass on social media marketing - a must for any broker looking to build their business. The headline act was Mr Mark Bouris of Yellow Brick Road and Apprentice Australia fame and he didn’t disappoint delivering his keynote in typical charismatic and confident style.

Race to the finish

At our very own stand we hosted delegates who lined up against each other on our racing simulator. Things were competitive through the day but our clear winner (if not of an actual race) was Peter White of the FBAA!

Gala dinner and awards

Festivities at Movie World are always fun and the 2016 edition didn’t disappoint. Capping off a great evening, big congratulations to the winners of the 2016 FBAA awards:

"Single Moms Are Like Real-Life Wonder Women

“The number one thing moms never discuss are the days that are really hard.”

Let’s be honest; being a single mother is hard.

Going through the ups (and many downs) of pregnancy, painfully pushing through childbirth, and then putting everything you have into raising a child is no easy feat, and when you have to face all of it alone without a partner to battle along with you, life can be even more difficult.

To help cope with the flood of emotions and new life experiences being thrown at her, she started The Single Mum Diaries, a blog which would allow her to write about all of the things she was learning, and as a support network for other women who might find themselves pregnant, alone, and without a clue what to do next.

Stead is honest, taking a no-holds-barred approach to single-motherhood on her blog and in life, and isn’t afraid to give her real thoughts on being a stand-alone parent, not needing a man in her life to ‘save the day’, and feeling like Wonder Woman at the end of a long day of parenting and doing it all on her own. I spoke to Stead about what she’d learned being a single mom, and why it’s empowering as hell for her…

When you found out you were pregnant, what things went through your head?

“When I found out I was pregnant I was really excited, but it was definitely unplanned. I was more of a ‘career’ type of person and my partner at the time had actually suggested having a baby and I told him it was not really something I wanted to do at that point in time. It was only a couple of days later that I thought “Oh, my period hasn’t come…” so the whole pregnancy was really quite a shock to me. Obviously, life had other plans for me and decided to send me down a completely different path”

What is some advice you give to women who have been left while pregnant?

“It’s such a difficult and emotional time. I think the main thing for me, whether it’s being left pregnant or an emotional relationship that’s fallen apart, is you’ve really got to get to a place in your mental state where you can start to use your pain as your power to move forward. That’s one of the mantras that I’m always telling women in these situations; use your pain as your power and go from looking at him as an ex-partner to looking at him as the father of your child, and try really hard to differentiate the two. Which, honestly, hasn’t gone too well for me but I’ve definitely done everything in my power to keep thinking about it that way.

I think that’s definitely my biggest piece of advice is to try to change your mindset about the situation, as hard as it can be. Because while you might want to just mope around and be really upset, I think when you’re pregnant, you’ve got that other person that you’re starting to think about as well so it isn’t as hard as a regular breakup, in my opinion, because you’ve got that force behind you.

So many of the women who I speak to that have been left pregnant are married, which shocks me because I just didn’t think that would be so common. I remember when I first fell pregnant and he left, I thought “We should have got married first and we could have worked through this situation,” but then I met all of these women saying their husbands just couldn’t handle the responsibility and left. And now these women have gone on to buy homes or start businesses and I look at them and I think they’re amazing.”

What are some things you’ve experienced as a single mom which have surprised you the most?

“Obviously, there are single moms out there who have the financial support of having an ex-partner who actually contributes, but then you’ve got people like me who are doing it all on their own. And we’re actually not as rare as I first I thought at the start. I thought to be a single mom was a really embarrassing thing but it actually happens to people every day. But the financial side of it was quite a shock to me.

That, and I think the other most surprising thing is the level of guts that it really takes every day to be everything that you need to be for two people. You really have to dig deep inside yourself to give yourself to your child when you’re going through something so big and don’t think you have the energy to get up and be a mother. You’ve really got to try hard to make sure you can get through every day and I think that’s been one of the most surprising things is just seeing myself get to a point where I’m so exhausted but then I get that second wave of energy where I realize I have to be a mom and I get up and do it.”

What’s the highest point of motherhood for you?

“Just seeing this little person grow up into someone that you’re proud of. That’s definitely the highest point for me. I just love seeing their little mannerisms come out and noticing the ways that they’re so kind. Ever is very much a caring little person who’s always hugging other kids at daycare and kissing people. She’s very caring towards them. So I think seeing their little personalities grow as they start to form into a person is definitely the highlight.”

What are some of the ‘unspoken’ negatives of being a single parent?

“I think the number one thing that moms never discuss are the days that are just really hard, and the days where you’re really struggling. I think they feel that if they share these bad feelings they’re going to be frowned upon. Privately, among mothers, we definitely talk about “Oh my god, I said this horrible thing today,” or, “I screamed at her,” or “I shouted at him,” and things like that which you’d never openly discuss. I try and do as much as I can of that on the blog without opening myself up to unnecessary negativity and be as honest as possible. I definitely think you need to be open about the days where you’re having a really tough time and not try to make it a joke. I think some moms try and sugar-coat the bad times as if they’re funny, and I think that can make other mothers feel a bit worse.

And the amount of mother-shaming you experience is such a crappy surprise as well. Online, yes, but even in public people will shame you because you’re not parenting the way that they would have. That’s a really big shock too. You’ve just entered motherhood and doing the best you can and strangers start saying to you “I’d have a sweater on that child,” or “Have you wrapped that baby up enough?” when they’re a newborn and the baby has 4 layers on and looks like it could be in the Antartic and you’re just thinking “yeah, I’m pretty sure it’s wrapped enough…”.”

How does being a single mom make you feel empowered?

“I think being a single mom is empowering because of the fact that you’re doing the roles of two people when most people have that other person. So I think you do sort of get an air about yourself like, “I can do anything because it normally takes two people to do this but I can do it all on my own.” That’s definitely something that I take a lot of pride in.

A lot of people write to me and say, “Oh my god I don’t know how you do it as a single mom. I have a husband or serious partner and I couldn’t imagine doing what you do.” When those comments come in I feel really proud of myself. Because I’m so knee-deep in single parent life I sometimes forget not everyone has to do it all on their own. I don’t really have anything to compare it to because Ever’s father was never in the picture. For me, I think you just need to give yourself a pat on the back and know that you are doing a great job and generally it takes two people, plus a whole entire tribe, so it’s pretty good to be coping on your own.

Everyone has their own path, that’s what I always say to people. Not many people are picked to travel such a hard road and I think people forget that. I think these kinds of things are not a coincidence; you were picked for this and the lessons that come from it, you were chosen to learn those. That’s what I believe anyway. Whether it’s starting something like the ‘Single Mum Diaries‘ and helping people all over the world, or buying your own house, or discovering how to be strong on your own, you’ll eventually learn why this has happened to you and it will all become clear to you.”

"“The Six Million Dollar Man” was one of the most memorable episodic TV action dramas of its day back in the early- to mid-1970s; but, strangely, it has rarely been seen since the long-running series was suddenly cancelled in 1978 after a successful run of five seasons and four TV movies. The show detailed the exploits of ex NASA test pilot turned secret agent, Steve Austin (Universal contract player Lee Majors), who worked for the Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI) under the ever-watchful eye of his best friend, Oscar Goldman (Richard Anderson) -- the Washington-based Governmental agent who sent him on his varied missions every week, involving everything from robotic replacements to Cold War telepathic spies and crime magnates, not to mention the odd towering, alien-created Bigfoot cyborg. Austin stood out as an ordinary guy made especially unique by science through having had his right arm, both his legs and his left eye replaced in pioneering work developed by Dr Rudy Wells (played by several actors across the run, but made iconic by Martin E. Brooks from series three onwards), after an near fatal plane crash left him nothing more than ‘a man barely alive’. At Wells’ secret Government funded Colorado research facility, Steve Austin was brought back from the brink, sporting new artificial limbs with ‘bionic’ components that gave him superhuman strength and enhanced 20:1 vision, to make him ‘better than he was before’.

Lee Majors quickly became a handsome 1970s sex symbol in polyester thanks to this show, which turned into a showcase for his trend-setting side-parting and his relaxed approach to the art of ‘raised eyebrow acting’, rivalling even the great Roger Moore for effortless charm. The actor was a true American hunk and as the show went on to become more and more popular, all those dynamic running poses with bell bottoms flapping, and the gigantic bionic leaps that so entranced impressionable viewing youngsters in 1970s playgrounds, were joined by an increasing awareness of Majors’ sex symbol status for young women -- with the actor often seen sporting unbuttoned shirts that exposed his copious chest hair at every opportunity from season four onwards; although the moustache he grew that year was always to be viewed as a big mistake by anyone with even a modicum of taste!

Majors’ impossibly model-beautiful wife of the time, Farrah-Fawcett Majors, appeared frequently as a guest star on the show in a manner that flagrantly courted the couple’s celebrity star status without shame before she became equally famous in her own right on “Charlie’s Angels”; and when the fresh-faced Jaime Sommers (Lindsay Wagner), the bionic woman, was introduced in a captivating two-part love story near the end of Season Two, bringing family atmosphere to the fore like never before, the series really caught the imagination: for this was suddenly an action show for all the family, one that also boasted a warm, folksy humanity in the midst of its otherwise way-out tales of Mabuse-like criminal masterminds with off-the-wall adventure plotting. The producers very cleverly were able to weave the series’ progressive can-do attitude regarding the potential achievements of technology and progress, into stories that also functioned as traditional homilies promoting an ethic of home-grown fortitude and fairness, and above all, humanity. To catch up with the show again after well over thirty years, thanks to this comprehensive boxed set ,which contains every single episode and TV movie ever made, including the reunion films of the 1980s and mid’90s and all the cross-over episodes of “The Bionic Woman”, soon proves to be something of a spur to some serious Proustian-style involuntary recall for those of us of a certain age, a flood of childhood experiences and feelings, tastes and sounds rushing back at the first sight of the cybernetically enhanced astronaut and all-round handsome hunk that was Steve Austin back then, in all his full-blown, slow motion, action posed prime, accompanied as always by Oliver Nelson’s brilliant swelling theme music sting and the unmistakable metallic-twang that constituted Austin’s famous ‘bionic’ audio sound effects.

The word bionic became entrenched in the modern vernacular as a result of this series and remains so today, and even despite the fact that watching back now what at the time always appeared to be a super-slick piece of high quality action drama, in hindsight often reveals a show that was clearly suffering from its impossibly tight six day shooting schedule and struggling to hold itself together coherently as a result with the help of Universal’s stock footage library and the studio’s standing sets, the show still works more often than not. Though it sometimes has to make do with relying on rudimentary, get-the-job-done, point-and-shoot camera work and rushed and awkward-sounding dialogue, nevertheless many of these episodes cause a tingle down the spine and produce a thrill of recognition to this day. The show still sports one of the great title sequences of all time, unbeaten for setting the scene and evoking the required atmosphere. Majors, Wagner and Anderson were perfectly cast to play enhanced versions of their own natural personas, developing a rapport that made every clumsy line and daft storyline resonate despite the silliness and cost-cutting fast production. These mono audio episodes vary in the quality of their surviving prints, generally getting better as the years pass, although all are perfectly acceptable. The episodes of “The Bionic Woman” included here for some reason look the most vibrant.

The collection comes utterly jam-packed with extras in the form of a multitude of featurettes which can be found on special supplementary discs dotted throughout the forty disc set. Each series has its own dedicated disc of extras, the centrepiece of which is an in-depth interview with one of the cast or crew, titled “OSI Debriefing”. The first one up is a one-hour-and-seventeen minute interview with executive producer Harve Bennett. Bennett tells how he was charged with turning the original premise, as featured in Richard Irving’s movie of the week (which had been adapted from a novel by Martin Caidin called Cyborg), into an initial series of thirteen episodes, with only six weeks’ notice from Universal; and he relates the pressures of shooting each of the episodes in just six days: a full one day less than was normal for most drama series at the time. He talks about how he went about portraying the character of Steve Austin differently from the way he had been envisioned in the previous two movies, playing more on Lee Majors’ ‘cowboy’ persona rather than the tuxedo-clad Bond figure he was being moulded into. And he lays emphasis on how the series focused on the character’s humanity in contrast to his superhuman capabilities. Bennett talks about the creation of the famous title sequence, the bionic sound effect created by Jim Troutman, and how Steven Bochco (who ghost wrote the pilot movie) played a key role in finding writers for the series -- many of whom created some of its most famous episodes. Bennett then talks at length about the campier elements of the show in later years, which started to appear as the way-out sci-fi themes began to play more of a part in the stories, particularly when concerning the frequent appearances of the ‘Bigfoot’ character. There’s also discussion of the spin-off series “The Bionic Woman” and the casting of Lindsay Wagner, plus the many crossover episodes, which were designed to carry over the audience from one show to the other. Bennett also talks about the relationship between Lee Majors and Farah Fawcett.

After Kenneth Johnson wrote the two-part episode “The Bionic Woman” for season two, Harve Bennett employed him as a producer-director on the following season, which included a Bionic Woman sequel which led to a spin-off series, and which he ended up producing at the same time as working on “The Six Million Dollar Man”. The extras disc for season three includes a 90 minute interview with Johnson which covers in great detail his entire career and includes a great many anecdotes concerning his development of and involvement with “The Incredible Hulk” TV series, as well as his work on the two bionic shows. This is a fascinating talk, covering just about every imaginable aspect of the show, made all the more compelling from the fact that Johnson has a good memory and a lively mind, and is able to talk non-stop without hesitation about a variety of related subjects, from his determination to inject some humour into the show (which he felt could sometimes come over as being a little over-earnest in its first season) to the sexism inherent in the Bionic Woman doll which was marketed, against his own wishes, with an emphasis on make-up and fashion. As well as recounting in much detail the making of his most famous stories, such as all the ones involving Jaime Sommers (a character he created from scratch) and the two-parter called “The Secret of Bigfoot”. Johnson talks about the particular type of realism-based escapist fantasy which marked out 1970s TV drama, and he even gives his own opinion on why the attempted re-boot of “The Bionic Woman” didn’t take off despite the continuing affection many people have for the original series. One really gets a great sense from this extensive interview of what it was like to produce episodic TV drama under high pressure conditions in the 1970s, and of the kinds of short cuts that so frequently were required just to get the show on the air in the time allowed. Amusingly, while commenting on the unusually close relationship between Oscar and Steve, Johnson reveals that he and writer James D. Parriott used to imagine that the two might be lovers and even (for their own amusement) often wrote scenes for them that ended with the two kissing!

Oscar Goldman, aka Richard Anderson, appears in a fifty-five minute interview in which he talks about the series in general, starting with how he first learned he’d got the role on the night before shooting began on the second TV movie. After staying up all night to get up to speed on the script, Anderson decided to wear shaded glasses for his first scene, to hide the inevitable bags under his eyes from the late night. Subsequently he developed a bit of business which became quite famous among fans, which was inspired by his hero Gary Cooper, in which he removed his glasses whenever he needed to underline a dramatic pause in the script. The veteran actor talks about the importance of the chemistry between himself and Lee Majors and how it gradually developed more and more the longer they worked together. Since his role in the series was mainly to provide set-up and exposition for whatever mission Steve Austin had been given on any particular week, it was important that the relationship between the two be believable. Anderson also talks about how the heroism evoked by the series had a great impact on audiences watching during difficult times in the 1970s. He mentions how different in tone “The Six Million Dollar Man” became from “The Bionic Woman”, with the former becoming more and more macho as it went along, while Lindsay Wagner’s influence militated more towards finding ways of avoiding overt violence to solve problems on her programme. He explains his famous tan as being a way of avoiding having to go into make-up, which he loathed; and he remembers the Oscar Goldman action figure, which came with its own toy office set! The soft-spoken actor is still an enthusiastic advocate for the programme, and he explains how it was he who got the reunion movies off the ground in the 1980s.

Martin E. Brooks takes part in a 63 minute interview about his three years on the show, recalling how he took over the role previously played by Martin Balsam and Alan Oppenheimer, of Dr Rudy Wells, after his long-time tennis partner Harve Bennett offered him the role as a ‘one shot’ job at the beginning of season three. In fact it turns out that both the actors who played the role before him were close friends of Brooks’. After starting out in the role by trying to grey his hair and make himself look more physically like Oppenheimer, Brooks eventually started playing the role ‘as himself’, after he was cast full time in the role. Brooks remembers the set as being full of good-natured male bonding based on practical jokes and humour, thanks largely to the influence of Lee Majors. He remembers Lee as being very athletically inclined and always eager to perform as many of the show’s stunts as he possibly could himself. Richard Anderson he remembers as someone who was obsessed about topping up his tan between takes, but he’s impressed about how Anderson developed the relatively thankless role of Oscar Goldman and made him into such an iconic part of the show. He talks about coordinating his role as Rudy Wells in both “The Six Million Dollar Man” and “The Bionic Woman”, and sometimes getting confused about which lines he was meant to be delivering, since he would sometimes be moving from set to set in the same day. He sees it as being a mistake to end the show after five seasons and is mystified as to why there were so few reruns once it was cancelled. Brooks looks back at some of the many guest stars who appeared, including a young Sandra Bullock, and recalls his favourite episodes of the show during his three year stint.

Finally, Lee Majors talks for 83 minutes on his career and his time on the show, recalling the changes made to the character between the TV films and the series to make it more child-friendly, especially since there was an emphasis on making Steve Austin more of an approachable, human character and on not having him constantly killing the baddies at the end of every story. He mentions working with Lindsay Wagner and Richard Anderson and particularly recalls the episodes involving Andre the Giant. He remembers the huge amount of running he had to do on the show (not always easy when wearing flared bell bottoms!) and his love of on-set practical jokes (which didn’t go down well with executive producer Harve Bennett), and recalls his insistence on doing as many of his own stunts as possible. His favourite episode is the football-themed one (which he also directed himself) and he mentions the dreadful song he wrote and sang for the Bionic Woman episode as well! The fight scene involving John Saxon in season 1 is a favourite memory, and we find out here that the moustache of season 4 was really a rebellious form of practical joke aimed at the executives who tried to enforce a certain look on him in order that episodes from different seasons might be mixed and still be screenable in any order. The executives in what Majors calls ‘the black tower’ only saw the moustache in dallies, by which time it was too late to do anything about it.

Much of the above extensive interview footage crops up again edited into other featurettes throughout the set, such as one that provides a fascinating look at the science of “Real Bionics” (11 minutes). Here, writers and producers on the show talk about how, at the time it was going out, they frequently received letters from real amputees, wanting to know where they could go to get bionic limbs fitted for them-selves. This could be particularly heartbreaking when the letters were from children; writer and producer Kenneth Johnson tells how he often had to try and gently break the news in his replies that no such bionic limbs existed in reality at that time. But in that curious way in which life so often imitates art, many of the technical experts who work in the field of bionics today (interesting that they actually do use that word as well!) were originally inspired to get into it by the series, and this featurette also demonstrates the cutting edge of the current technology being created for some of the veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan -- including the latest high-tech artificial leg that can match its gait with that of the person it’s attached to after being hooked up to a laptop that runs special software which helps the limb reprogram itself.

Meet The Cast featurettes: again, mostly composed of clips from the full-length interviews, these profile pieces for Lee Majors, Lindsay Wagner, Richard Anderson and Rudy Wells feature the actors, and various producers and directors discussing how each actor got the role originally, and what made them so special in the parts as they developed their characters across the seasons. Each one runs for between 10 and 15 minutes.

“An iconic Opening” (18 minutes) looks in detail at the thinking behind and the actual craft that went into the creation of the iconic title sequence. Jack Cole was an experienced director of title sequences for US TV drama in the 1970s and he and Harve Bennett talk about how they took footage from the original pilot movie and remoulded it to make the dramatic intro which became world famous. Looking at how they selected and combined images, the layering of sound and the way in which the title sequence created a particular visual quality and set up the texture and tone of the show for the episode that came after it, this is a really enlightening documentary on an important aspect of the creation of a TV series that is so often overlooked, even though it quite often ends up being the one thing fans remember the most vividly.

“Season VIPs: The Six Million Dollar Man Guest Stars” is, naturally enough, a light-hearted look at the careers of some of the actors who have appeared as guest stars, which examines the characters they played with the help of various fans and classic TV experts who feature as talking heads. Each season comes with its own featurette in which the guest stars for that particular collection of episodes are noted and their performances commented upon. These come dotted throughout the collection and run for around 10 minutes each.

“Bionic Breakdown” is really just a collection of clips from across the entire five series run, which demonstrate the capabilities and the uses to which Steve Austin puts his bionic limbs during the series’ five year history. The writers would quite often add new bionic features on a whim for that week’s specific episode it seems, so if you thought it was all about the exercising of terrific strength etc., think again: the eye can be anything from a heat wave detector one week to an infra-red sensor the next, as well as the 20:1 magnifier it’s mostly used for; and when he’s not using it to bend iron bars and snap locks, the arm also doubles as a radiation detector and even a power supply unit.

“Bionic Sound Effects” relates how the distinctive synthesised clanging noise, christened ‘the singing sword’, which became so associated with the use of Steve Austin’s bionic powers along with the slow motion effect, was gradually introduced into the series. In fact, all of the famous sound effects were not fully and consistently in place until well into season three of the series.

“The Six Million Dollar Man Fans: So Loyal, So Bionic!” is a light-hearted 13 minute featurette in which fans recount their memories of watching the show when growing up, and tell what it meant to them at the time. Also various directors and crew members, as well as Lindsay Wagner, talk about their impression of the fans and their dedication to the show.

“The Six Million Dollar Man’s Best Villains and Fights” is another light piece in which fans and production members list some of the most memorable episodes in terms of providing formidable foes for the bionic man to battle against. John Saxon’s robot Major Sloan, Monte Markham’s the Seven Million Dollar Man and the unstoppable death probe machine are some of the main contenders, along with various aliens, the Fembots and, of course, the ever-popular Bigfoot. This lasts for 17 minutes.

“TV Goes Bionic: The Origins of the Six Million Dollar Man” is a featurette in which fans, producers and actors talk about how the series got going initially as a TV movie based on a series of novels by lecturer, teacher and pilot-turned sci-fi novelist Martin Caidin, and how it took something of a wrong turn when ABC tried to mould the character of Steve Austin as a James Bond hero in the follow-up movies.

“The Bionic Age of TV: The Success of the Six Million Dollar Man” takes up the story again when Harve Bennett takes over control of the TV series for its first season and collaborates with Lee Majors to emphasis the humanity of the character. The show’s success was consolidated when Bennett brought in new writers such as James Perriott and Kenneth Johnson who then created Jaime Sommers, leading to a spin-off show and many cross-over episodes. The featurette goes on to track the main highlights of all five seasons, including the Bigfoot episodes and the introduction of the campy Fembots. Kenneth Johnson talks about how the production was constantly under the Universal cosh, with the emphasis always being on churning the episodes out on time and without overspending.

“Top Secret: OSI, NASA and Bionics” is a short featurette looking at how the show dealt with technology, secret services, and how NASA often gave the show the opportunity to film at some of their rocket facilities, such as Cape Canaveral.

“The Reunion Movies: Life after the Series” talks to the producers, writers and directors behind the three reunion TV movies shot for NBC and CBS in the ‘80s and ‘90s. The projects got rolling at the insistence of Richard Anderson and after initial reluctance by Majors and Wagner to get involved, the resultant films did at least bring the relationship between a now much chunkier and wrinklier Steve Austin, and a more mature Jaime Sommers, to its inevitable slushy and romantic conclusion.

“The Pop Culture Effect” looks at the elements which came together to make the show iconic in a TV landscape of medical dramas and cop shows: the memorable music, the use of slow motion, the bionic sound effects. In later years these helped provide the substance of a great many references and parodies in other films, from “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” to “Family Guy”. (12 minutes)

“Bionic Action … Figures!!” An enjoyable 30 minute documentary about all those toys and action figures and the other merchandising such as lunch boxes and puzzles the show spawned. Everyone remembers the Steve Austin action figure with its detachable bionic arm, complete with roll-up skin so that you could see his bionic components; but the series also gave rise to a host of other figures and appliances: from Steve’s rocket/revival capsule to Oscar Goldman’s exploding briefcase; from Bigfoot to Maskatron, the ultimate robot foe -- this film looks at them all again with the help of the cast themselves (Lindsay Wagner ruefully recalls her excitement at getting to see her doll for the first time, only to realise that it looked more like Farrah-Fawcett Majors!) and dedicated fans of the show.

“The Stunts of the Bionic Age: Pushing the Envelope” is a 28 minute documentary in which Lee Majors and his stunt double Vince Deadrick recall perfecting the backwards jump and talk about the most dangerous stunts in the shows history, including one in which the stunt coordinator almost died and another in which Majors found himself teetering, suspended two-hundred feet from the ground on greasy cable car wires, because the stunt double was too ill to take his place. Rita Egleston also talks about doubling for Lindsay Wagner on “The Bionic Woman” and having to have her skirt weighed down at the hem in order to stop it ruining the backwards jumping effects by flairing upward!

The two-part episode “The Bionic Woman” is the first in the set to get a commentary, and it’s a typically well-prepared one from the episodes’ writer (and later producer of both “The Six Million Dollar Man and its spin-off “The Bionic Woman”) Kenneth Johnson, as he goes into lots of detail about the development of the original idea and the storyline, and also how Universal wanted a romantic episode with a death at the end to cash in on the success at the time of the movie “Love Story”. The episodes mark a distinct change in tone for the series, but such was the popularity of the character of Jaime Sommers and her rekindled romance with childhood sweetheart Steve Austin that the producers were soon working on a way to bring her back. Johnson makes clear the constraints these episodes were made under, and although his idea of a low budget would’ve seemed like spectacular luxury to many British TV producers at the time, the crew were still attempting to shoot an hour-long film in just six days when a movie would take six times that much time under normal circumstances. Johnson remarks on the perfunctory, flat TV lighting style and the unadventurous point-and-shoot directing aesthetic so common in TV at the time, and emphasises just how much of the popularity of the show came down to the chemistry and performances of the actors who often had to sell some pretty hastily written material through charisma alone.

Johnson also provides a commentary on season three’s pinnacle and probably one of the most memorable stories from the entire series, the two-part “The Secret of Bigfoot”. Once again, the producer/writer has done his homework and is able to provide extensive filmographies and biographical information about every guest player seen here, including of course the striking performer who played Bigfoot himself, Andre the Giant: a former wrester who spoke only French and who stood 7 foot six inches tall. We learn some unlikely facts about Andre’s life, including that he lived next door to Samuel Beckett as a child and that the great playwright used to drive him to school! Johnson reveals how the story was written to take advantage of the Universal tour’s ice tunnel ride, but is quick to point out the dated aspects of the production caused by the need to shoot quickly and also because each episode ran at least five minutes short, which forced him to pad them out with lots of stock footage from the Universal archives. He also reveals how the striking white contact lenses used by Andre as part of his Bigfoot makeup gave Johnson the idea to use the same makeup effect when he came to make “The Incredible Hulk” TV pilot movie. Johnson talks about the importance of finding writers who could work quickly and come up with usable ideas, and how the executive producer credit was often used as a means simply of keeping good writers on-board, since once you found someone who could supply what you needed to keep the show on the air, you did anything you could to hang onto them! Johnson is clearly frustrated by some of the limitations he had to work under and is quick to point out the kinds of flaws in episodes that make them ripe these days for Mystery Science Theatre treatment; but despite Kenneth Johnson being strongly associated with the more science fiction elements on the show, especially after his subsequent involvement with shows such as “The Incredible Hulk”, the original “V” and “Alien Nation”, it becomes clear that it is the human element which is indicative of many of his best episodes on the series, especially the ones involving Steve’s relationship with Jaime Sommers, and which makes them continue to endure in fans’ affections.

Director Cliff Bole is remembered for his work on “Star Trek: The Next Generation” and “The X Files”, but he started as an assistant director on “The Bionic Woman”, and while working as such on an episode of “The Six Million Dollar Man” entitled “The Blue Flash” found himself promoted after the original director quit the project over objections to the script, three days into a six day prep. In the commentary for the episode, Bole, like Kenneth Johnson, emphasises the pressures and time constraints involved in making the show back in the ‘70s, and points out how some warehouse scenes were varied by simply moving some boxes around and leaving the camera in the same spot to try and make it look like they were shooting in a different part of the set! He also talks about how the zoom lens had recently come into vogue and that everyone was using it way too much, something especially noticeable when you re-watch these episodes today. He talks about the professionalism of Lee Majors and also how he liked to play practical jokes on the crew. He was also good with children apparently -- a much needed skill in this episode, which featured child star Rodney Allen Rippy, then known in the US for some now-forgotten TV commercials, but who didn’t otherwise have much experience of acting and would tend to lose concentration under the hot lights.

On his commentary for the episode “Vulture of the Andes”, Bole reveals that to save money sometimes entire storylines were written around stock footage. In this case the production had fifteen minutes of documentary footage of gliders in the air, which they matched up with similar looking planes for the ground scenes. There was no second unit on the show; the whole thing had to be shot in six days. Bole compares the schedule to a later show like “The X-Files”, where he had fifteen days to finish an episode and a second unit as well! He also reveals that the reason Lee Majors disappears from the episode for about fifteen minutes of screen time, Steve’s place taken by another OSI agent while he recovers from a mishap with his bionic arm, was because Majors had to make a personal appearance elsewhere for the network in the middle of the shoot, a fairly common occurrence when the series was at the peak of its popularity. By this time, all Majors’ costumes were being designed so that his shirts were unbuttoned to mid-chest, since the actor was ‘popular with the ladies’ and by season four, his sex appeal was being spotlighted in a way it hadn’t been since the early TV movies which had tried to pitch the character as a kind of superhero James Bond. Bole looks back on the show with fond memories and recalls a level of camaraderie he’s not experienced again since on any other show, and he was surprised but gratified to learn that the series still retains a large fan base.

The set also features the padded out two-part versions of all three TV movies and, finally, each series comes with a photo gallery of production stills from the episodes making up that particular season. With all the TV movies (including the attempted pilot “The Bionic Boy”), spin-off episodes, reunion movies and five-years-worth of episodes the viewer will be detained for quite some time by this diverting trip down memory lane, and that’s before we even consider the hours and hours of documentary and featurette material also included across forty discs. Without doubt, this is worth saving up for if you’ve ever had any interest in classic action adventure TV. Highly recommended.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

How Video Games Made Me A Better Person

First, a disclaimer: I have a lot of privilege. I code as white (ethnically I'm from a group that has had its whiteness revoked and been the target of genocides, but most people don't know that unless I tell them). I'm a guy (kinda). I'm not straight but I have spent most of my life under the umbrella of straight privilege. Raised middle class, although I'm now poor on paper. Able-bodied except for some neurodivergence. Those marginalized statuses I have, you probably couldn't tell by looking at me, so I pass, out in the world. These experiences are from my point of view, and they may be somewhat sophistic to people who experience marginalization and systematic oppression every day.

I tend to be a bit outspoken when it comes to social justice issues. When I say ""tend to"" and ""a bit,"" you understand that I mean most of my friends (even those who agree with me) have gone through at least one or two moments on Facebook where they said, ""Chris, please shut up. Please for the love of God, just stop posting. Just for a few minutes. Just this once. Please!""

From time to time, however, someone manages to pin me down for a lunch date or corners me at a party where I'm being reserved, shy, and not at all like my online persona, and they often end up wondering about how I came to care so much about the issues I talk so much about. Formative experiences about speaking out against injustice involve my mom, and no small amount of my bravery can be attributed to my idolization of Luke Skywalker. But those experiences set a tone. They laid the foundation for wanting to be morally good. They don't themselves help me parse the thicket of discourse to determine what the right thing is.

That comes from video games.

When I was young, video games were pretty simple. The first game I ever played involved a square picking up an arrow to go look for a chalice, and my favorite game required you to run to the right until you died three times. (You could run to the left, but the crocodiles were easier to jump going right.) And of course there was an inexplicable hostility that a certain airplane had for the river it was raiding.

Boss fight. Circa 1979.
Shit just got real, yo.

As I grew up, video games got better and their objectives improved. There was plenty of rescuing princesses, of course, and stopping alien brains, and terrorist organizations who apparently had the money to build giant fighting mecha but didn't think to put some motion detectors outside their death fortresses, but we also started to see more complex machinations. Villains didn't always just twirl their mustaches or go by names like Sinistar–some of them even thought they were the good guy.

As we reached the turn of the century, and video games began to come into their own as a complex and nuanced art form, we gamers began to take on the avatar mantle of heroes in much more complicated dramas. Sometimes we were on the wrong side when we started out. Sometimes the villains lied. Sometimes complicated political dramas were unfolding with no moral protagonist.
Of course, these days, in video games, we can even choose to be complete epic seepage dripping assholes, adding a whole new layer of choice and complexity to the journey of the gamer.

Like COMPLETE seepage dripping assholes.

And as weird as it might sound, all this nuance and flexibility has helped me to be a better person. We can all figure out how to be a good guy when evil aliens show up to destroy Earth. We can all make the ""right"" choice when some eight-foot-tall fucking BDSM turtle kidnaps a woman who's begging for help. But as things get more complicated, and everyone is just looking out for their own interests, it becomes a little tougher to figure out whose side of the story to listen to.

That's where video games come in.

Imagine you fired up a video game and entered in the starting city of a modern (yet steampunk because steampunk is awesome) town. You're probably going to talk to a bunch of people and find out what's going on because you've played enough video games to know that's what you do. And unless you're very impatient, you will probably start by talking to everyone. You won't skip the ""Falcons"" group and only ever talk to the ""Razorbacks."" They've all got stories. You won't ignore someone who lives in the bad part of town. You know (as any good gamer knows) that there may be vital information in the hands of basically anyone.

You don't value any stories more than any others.

Now imagine the first people you talk to are kind of bitter and mean. They treat you with some hostility. They don't trust you. They don't like you. But they do talk to you, and when they do, they tell you of terrible things happening to them from the government. Every single one of them has a story about how their experience isn't fair. They don't get enough steam for their punks in their part of town. They are powerless. Poor. If any of them protest their unfair conditions, they are often the subjects of violence. This isn't just a coincidence either. They aren't randomly the poor people. They are HELD DOWN because of some immutable factor of their birth. They may even ask you to help them. They have definite perceptions about the injustice in which they exist. They say it is all around and permeates their lives. Their ancestors were very badly treated, and even though things are better, they still aren't equal.

As you move on, you discover a second group. They are much nicer and friendlier. They like you. They treat you well. They flirt with you (unlocking romance options far more easily). This group lives in a better part of town. They are, by and large, richer and much more powerful. They have all the steam they need and their punks are well stocked. Almost everyone on the TV shows is from the second group and they control the voice that comes over the city-wide PA system telling everyone what a fine equality-loving society they all live in. Almost everyone in political power is from the second group. Almost every notable person in this city's history seems to be from the second group.

Group Two will tell you at length about how the first group is making things up. Sure, they were an unfair society long ago in the before time, but that's all ancient history (the ancient history of one generation ago). Now it's laughable that things aren't totally equitable. Certainly there aren't any deep-seated inequalities to overcome.

They tell you that the first group just wants to put them down. The first group is lazy. The first group won't work to pull themselves up. They say the first group is simply playing the victim because of the benefits they hope to get from pity. In some cases they acknowledge that some *VERY MINOR* injustice still exists, in a detached and intellectual way, but they insist that it is self correcting, often dismiss specific claims of Group One, and firmly believe that any attempts by the first group to right the injustice are ""far far worse than the inequity itself."" They really discourage you from listening to the first group's stories. Not overtly, of course––at least not at first––but by explaining that they are better able to see injustice than group one, and there isn't any. Of course, if you keep talking to group one, they'll stop being so nice, stop flirting with you. Stop treating you so well...

Laws exist that make it extremely difficult for the people in Group One to advance themselves into the worlds of Group Two (though technically it is possible and a few have done it to much fanfare and are often touted as evidence that everything is better now). Further, a few people in Group Two are quite overt about how they are superior and should be in a better position. They blame most of the Group One's troubles on the actions, culture, behaviors of Group One, often suggesting that if they would just be less hostile, work harder, and accept their lot, they would probably be in a better situation. There are many theories about why the first group is disadvantaged and they are all discussed by the second group with a sort of intellectual detachedness. Many in Group Two talk at length about what they would do to have better lives if they were in Group One.

It is considered uncouth to voice the opinion openly and directly that Group One is inferior, but when it happens (and it seems to strangely often), such opinions are merely considered impolite and part of living in a free society where people can say what they want. They are not immediately censured and aggressively repudiated in the same way as Group One's cries of injustice are....always. Still, it seems that in whispers and through double speak, Group Two is really allowed to speak as horribly as they want about Group One.

Group Two has nothing to gain and everything to lose from even the acknowledgement of the injustice. Group Two's elite enjoy a vast and inexhaustible supply of cheap labor from Group One. And you even discover that there are actual laws and regulations (on top of social consequence and effect) that make it much much harder for anyone from Group One to rise up. Plus Group One is secretly treated worse in virtually every situation––financing, employment, payment...you name it. And Group Two is blaming them for bad things that have begun to happen and looking to make life even worse for them.

Now here is my question to you as a gamer.

Would you, playing this game, have even the SLIGHTEST difficulty realizing what was going on in this scenario? Would anyone not know which group to support to get the ""good"" ending and which would get the ""evil"" ending?

Video games helped me to realize that most people look around our world from the inside. We've been here our whole lives. We're used to it. We're desensitized. WE ARE THE NPC's! We are the status quo. But as soon as we look at our world from the perspective of someone who just turned the game on five minutes ago, it becomes shockingly, absurdly, spectacularly easy to realize what is really going on.

When we take the time to listen to the stories of different people, as we would if we were walking around a game world trying to figure out what was going on (and instead of listening to who was in power), we immediately get a sense that our world is not just haphazardly and randomly unfair, but is systematically oppressive. Instead of letting the group in charge tell us that it's fair or as fair as it can be or any unfairness is probably the fault of those suffering, we can go and get the stories from the people themselves and listen to them. The minute we listen to everyone as if they have something vital and important to tell us (and they do) about this world, the truth is laid bare. When we value all the stories around us as equal instead of letting those in power explain away inequality it is almost comical how apparent the injustices are.

In my world (as distressingly unsteampunk as it is) I have a choice to listen to one group–the group in power (a largely male, white, heterosexual, able-bodied, cis group)–who insists that nothing is really wrong that couldn't be fixed if people would just try harder instead of complaining. Or I can seek out other voices and other narratives and let the people best equipped to describe their own situations describe it for themselves. Women who've experienced harassment and sexism. People of color who've experienced racism and xenophobia. Disabled people who've found difficulty accessing the same services as the able-bodied. Gender-variant folks who have a world of difficulties that cis folks do not. I can find those folks and I can listen to their stories and see that they paint a very VERY different picture than those overwhelming the mainstream. And once I have bothered to listen to the stories of those who are not in control of the narrative–and treated those stories as equal to the ones who are–it's only a matter of deciding whether I want to be Luke Skywalker or a seeping asshole.

my FNSI results

Here is what i made last night for FNSI. A purdy spring bag made from the Shoulder Tote pattern by Quilts Illustrated. i made a few different adjustments, but its always been one of my favorite ""easy"" bags to make. have you all tried the patterns from quilts illustrated? This bag was 16x16 before sewing. its a great daily bag to use for work etc.

A friend of mine had asked me awhile ago for a pinks and greens bag. After digging through my stash, the best fabs i could come up with were Woodland Bloom. See my quilt hanging next to it using the same line? I still love woodland bloom.

I had to get creative and move around the house to get a decent photo. Ive been on the go and forgot to take daytime photos!!! grrrrrr.

last night i locked myself in my MOM CAVE and sewed away. I drank iced tea, ate pretzels and cheese, listened to some nice mellow music.....it was a perfect night for FNSI.

These fabrics are so cheery.....

Because the outside was so busy, i made the inside very simple with linen and some fab pockets.

Remember to check HEIDIS blog tomorrow for the FNSI winner. im going to spend my night surfing at all of your projects. (oh how times have changed.....my saturday nights are so boring now--LOL)
I always get some cute ideas from you gals.

I've seen some cute quilted bags recently - here on your blog and all around my town - I think this would be a great idea for next month's FNSI! I'll have one month to pick out fabric and a pattern :-) Thanks for the great idea! Mary Ann at www.rocknquilts.blogspot.com

Love the bag! So cute. I kind of double booked my Friday night. I signed up with good intentions and then realized that a wedding I was helping with was the next day. I had a lot to do. But because of you and Hiedi's motivation, I did keep in mind to do something this week. So I crocheted 5 red dishcloths!!!!",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"BLM Wild Horse Roundup Set for Oct. 15

The Bureau of Land Management has announced that operations will begin Saturday, Oct. 15, to round up excess wild horses from public lands in northwest Nevada, about 40 miles east of Cedarville, Calif.

The BLM said about 1,300 wild horses will be gathered and about 1,090 removed from the range to bring populations to within the appropriate management level range of 258 to 451 animals. Wild horses removed from the range will be taken to the BLM's short term Litchfield Corrals near Susanville and the Palomino Valley National Wild Horse and Burro Center north of Reno. They will be made available for public adoption after receiving vaccinations or other needed veterinary care.

Horses that are not adopted will be held in large Midwestern pastures to live out their lives.

“Our goal is to manage healthy wild horse herds on healthy rangelands in balance with other authorized users of the public range,” said Nancy Haug, manager of the BLM’s Northern California District, which oversees these wild horse herd management areas. “To keep the herds and the land healthy, we need to keep populations at levels the range can sustain, while meeting needs of users such as wildlife and livestock.”

In addition to removing excess animals from five herd management areas collectively referenced as the High Rock Complex, the 1,090 horses removed will include nearly 400 horses that are living outside of herd management areas. These removals are required by the federal Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act.

Members of the public are welcome to observe gather operations from vantage points at each capture site.

Anyone interested can meet with the BLM staff at 5:30 a.m. daily, at the BLM Surprise Field Office, 602 Cressler St., Cedarville, Calif. They are responsible for their own transportation in a high clearance four wheel drive vehicle, beverages and food for the day. The BLM will maintain an informational telephone line at (530)279-2816 to provide daily updates on observation opportunities.

Details about the upcoming roundup are available in several environmental documents posted online at www.blm.gov/ca/surprise.

Wild horses and burros are protected by the Wild Free Roaming Horses and Burros Act which requires the BLM to manage wild herds as part of a “thriving natural ecological balance on the range.” The law mandates the removal of excess animals when populations exceed established levels.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"IMO ... We need to knock the repuplicans and democrats around at LEAST one year and vote for a third party ... Found this guy after 60 seconds of searching, and already seems like a better candidate than either Obama or Romney.

Maybe then, we'll have some actual decent competitors that know what the hell is going on in our country. Not the 1% that doesn't know about the other 99%, or the black guy that was going to ""change the world"" but has barely changed his own smirk in 4 years.

Oh, and my Facebook response to my old co-worker that posted it and turned it into a debate. I was being sarcastic btw...

I feel he would just take the tax breaks and use the money to finish his house and continue his lavish lifestyle instead of growing his business and create more jobs. Rich hoard; while it can be argued that the things bought and his house being built in and of itself stimulate the economy and create jobs, I can't but help feel more New business and jobs would be created if the money was put in the hands of the middle class; the middle class is on a mission to survive not be complacent with content like a wealthy person. If you're wealthy why would you work harder for your next bill, but if your poor or middle class wouldn't you ramp up production to meet the demand of a outstanding bill ?

I feel he would just take the tax breaks and use the money to finish his house and continue his lavish lifestyle instead of growing his business and create more jobs.

This is what history tells us always happens when you put more money in the hands of the wealthy and jack up corporate profits. And why would it do anything else? There's no market pressure to increase wages or hire.

Just look at our last corporate profit repatriation holiday, for instance. It was all hyped up as going to create jobs, increase wages, etc. What did it actually do? CEO bonuses.

Why do people continuously fall for this supply side bull****? Wages go up and businesses hire when they're forced to by competition for workers (And collective bargaining), increased demand (Ultimately from consumers), and similar pressures in the job market. Nothing else.

I feel he would just take the tax breaks and use the money to finish his house and continue his lavish lifestyle instead of growing his business and create more jobs. Rich hoard; while it can be argued that the things bought and his house being built in and of itself stimulate the economy and create jobs, I can't but help feel more New business and jobs would be created if the money was put in the hands of the middle class; the middle class is on a mission to survive not be complacent with content like a wealthy person. If you're wealthy why would you work harder for your next bill, but if your poor or middle class wouldn't you ramp up production to meet the demand of a outstanding bill ?

He did. When he started this house he fired 22 people in one day. Then 10 the next, 15 the next so on and so forth.

I think the employers call is clear. His taxes go up he will take peoples job to maintain his lavish lifestyle. It may be selfish but its legal and fair.

On the other hand if he were getting a tax incentive for hiring more people, he'd do that and everybody would win.

Exactly, the guy doesn't know squat about macro economics.

Haha, nice. Make it about his lifestyle and not his business. He is clearly evil because he cares about himself more than his employees, right? Why does anyone start their own business? If you say anything but ""to make money"" you are wrong. Companies started for any other reason do not succeed.

Tax incentives wouldn't do anything. There is no way to create a tax incentive for hiring people unless you do away with medicare/caid, payroll tax, Unempl. ins tax, etc that are direcrly related to hiring. The only way to increase hiring activity in any business is to allow the business to keep more of their revenue, period. This means lowering the marginal tax rates as well as the employment taxes to incentivitze growing the business. Business owners will not hire more people if it doesn't make monetary sense for their business.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Plot

Today is the day a princess gets chosen to host the Royal Prep Tea Party. Sofia tells everyone that before she was a princess, she and her friends would spread blankets on the ground and borrow tea cups from their mothers. But Amber, Hildegard, and Clio tell her that the Tea Party is a big deal because the whole class goes including the Fairies, and they hosted bigger parties. When Sofia is chosen to host the next Royal Prep Tea Party, Hildegard and Clio tell her that she needs to do better than borrowed tea cups.

At the castle, Sofia shows Amber and James that she wants to host one of the tea parties she used to have with Ruby and Jade, only this time, they get to use the castle tea cups and get to paint them. While James likes this idea, Amber doesn't because she thinks it's too small. She tells Sofia that she's her secret weapon for throwing a fabulous party, and she convinces her that bigger is better. Baileywick gives Sofia a planer to plan her party. Sofia decides on a swan themed tea party with swan shaped cookies and cakes. Ruby and Jade come over to have tea with her. She takes them to her hideaway: a secret garden. While the three of them have tea and biscuits, Sofia tells Ruby and Jade about the tea party for Royal Prep and wishing she could throw a party like the one she's having with them but feels she has to be considerate of her guests and Amber says her guests want a big and fancy party.

Sofia is selecting the plates and wants the plain white plates but Amber takes over and picks the shiny gold ones. When Sofia is picking the goblets, Amber takes over again and picks the biggest ones. Sofia is starting to feel overwhelmed and says this is starting to look more like a feast instead of a tea party but Amber says you can never have too much of a good thing. When Amber finds out the size of the cookie samples after James ate them all, she insists that they be as big as possible which Sofia, out of consideration of her guests, reluctantly agrees to despite James's protests. Cedric agrees to make the tables float. Sofia asks the swans to help with her party and they agree. Amber decides to add a ice swan to the mix. Sofia is dismayed by how big Amber made her plan her party and James is annoyed that Amber didn't let Sofia make her own decisions. Sofia finishes by getting a new dress prepared for the party.

The next day, Miranda comes out to see the party and notices how overwhelmed Sofia is. Suddenly, disaster strikes: The ice swan is accidentally sent into the swans pond. The spooked swans crash into Cedric, causing him to lose control of the floating tables, causing a mess and making them fly away. Sofia is upset because the party is ruined and she doesn't have time to plan another big party. Miranda asks her if she even wanted to throw a big party and Sofia says she didn't but only did so because she wanted to be considerate of her guests. Miranda tells Sofia that she's the host and it's what she wants that matters. Sofia decides to throw the party she wants in her hideaway and the guests declare it the best tea party they ever attended.

"Chinese party cadre jailed for taking bribes

BEIJING (AP) — A court in southern China sentenced a former Communist Party cadre who gained notoriety last year for amassing a large number of properties to 11 years and 6 months in prison on Thursday.

Cai Bin, formerly a party official at a local urban management bureau, was convicted of taking 2.75 million yuan ($450,000) in bribes, and the illegal gains were turned over to the state treasury, the party-run People’s Daily said on its news site.

Investigations against Cai began after online reports alleged Cai and his family owned 22 properties and questioned how a government official could afford them in a country where a working family struggles to buy one apartment in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.

China’s web users gave Cai the nickname “Uncle House,” and a following online movement exposed several more government officials with excessive real estate holdings, including a bank official who had 41 properties in Beijing.

Members of the Chinese public have resorted to the Internet, especially social media, to expose corruption, but Chinese authorities are wary of having to respond to public demands.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Question No: 51

You are developing a test case that must be run multiple times with different input values for a specific field each time. You have a list of values that will be used for the input.

You need to modify the test to enter each value into the field.

What should you do?

Insert a parameter into the Action column of the test step and enter the input values into the Parameter Values pane.

Insert a parameter into the Expected Results column of the test step and enter the input values into Parameter values pane.

Insert a parameter into the Action column of the test step.

Create test steps for each input value in the Action column.

Answer: A

Explanation: Add parameters to a test case

Create a parameter by typing a name preceded by quot;@quot; in the actions and expected results of your test steps.

Note: When you write a manual test, you often want to specify that the test should be repeated several times with different test data. For example, if your users can add different quantities of a product to a shopping cart, then you want to check that a quantity of 200 works just as well as a quantity of 1.

To do this, you insert parameters in your test steps. Along with the test steps, you provide a table of parameter values.

Reference: Repeat a test with different data

Question No: 52

You are using Microsoft Test Manager (MTM) to manage test cases. You want to review all test cases with shared steps.

You need to build a direct links query that will generate a list of all test cases in the team project that use a shared step.

Which three actions should you perform? (Each correct answer presents part of the solution. Choose three.)

Set the linked work items filter to Work item type = Shared Steps.

Set the main query to Team Project = @Project AND Work Item Type = Test Case.

Return all top-level work items.

Return only items that have the specified links.

Return only items that do not have the specified links.

Answer: A,B,D Explanation:

Q: How do I link test cases, shared steps, and test results?

A: The link types, Tested and Tested By are used to link test cases to work items, and Test Case and Shared Steps are used to link Shared steps to test cases. Using Microsoft Test Manager, you can create test cases and test plans which define and manage these associations. Also, Test Manager creates and manages the associations of test results to test cases and test plans.

Question No: 53

You are managing test cases by using Microsoft Test Manager (MTM).

You plan to test a part of your product on a specific configuration you create.

You need to ensure that new test cases in a specific test suite default to use this configuration without impacting other test suites.

What should you do?

Create a new test plan for testing with the specific configuration.

Select all test cases in the test suite and select the specific configuration.

Select the specific configuration as the default configuration for the test plan.

Select the specific configuration as the default configuration for the test suite.

Answer: D

Explanation: At any time when you are planning what to test, you can add test configurations and set them as the default configurations for your test plan. When you next add test cases to the test plan, a pairing of each default configuration with the test case is added to the test plan. When you run the tests from the test plan, these pairings called test points are shown and each can be run individually. Test results are saved for each test point.

You can also override the default test configurations for the plan and set different default configurations for a specific test suite. When test cases are added to these test suites, a pairing of each default configuration for the test suite with the test case is added to the test plan as shown in the following illustration.

Reference: How to: Select Different Test Configurations For a Test Plan or a Test Suite

Question No: 54

You are using Microsoft Test Manager (MTM). You plan to reduce the maintenance of test suites.

What are two possible types of test suites that achieve this goal? (Each correct answer presents a complete solution. Choose two.)

Exploratory-based

Static

Query-based

Requirements-based

Answer: C,D

Explanation: C: Query-based suites show the results of a query that you define. For example, you could select all the test cases that have Priority = 1.

D: Requirements-based suites are derived from Product Backlog Items, User Stories, or other requirements. The suite contains all the test cases that are linked to its requirement. This type helps you track how well each requirement has been tested.

Question No: 55

You are using Microsoft Test Manager (MTM) to perform exploratory testing.

You need to ensure that any bugs or test cases created during an exploratory test session are associated with a specific requirement for the purposes of traceability.

What should you do?

From the Test activity, select View Exploratory Test Sessions. Open a session and click

the Copy Link button.

From the Run Tests activity, select a test case that is a part of a requirement suite and select Run.

->Open Microsoft Test Manager.

->On the center group switcher, choose the down-arrow and then choose Testing Center.

->On the center group menu bar, choose Organize.

->On the menu, choose Shared Steps Manager.

->In the list of shared step, choose the row for the shared step for which you want to create an action recording.

Question No: 59

You are using Microsoft Test Manager (MTM). A test case is already in production.

You need to modify the test case to indicate it is being reworked. What should you do?

Change the test case state to Design.

Change the test case to Blocked.

Change the test case state to Closed.

Change the test plan state to Inactive.

Answer: A

Explanation: No test cases are ready to be run.

When all test cases remain in a design state for a long time, some issue is blocking progress. You might want to investigate the cause of the blockage.

Note: Update the state of each test case as it progresses from Design to Ready to Closed.

Question No: 60

You are using Microsoft Test Manager (MTM).

You plan to design a shared steps work item with the possibility that it will be used with multiple rows of test data.

You need to create a test case that contains the shared steps in multiple iterations. You also need to provide different test data for each iteration.

What should you do?

Create a copy of the shared steps work item and provide different values for the parameters in the original shared steps work item and its copy. Use the different shared steps work items in the test cases to get different test data.

Create an action recording of the shared steps work item and specify multiple parameter values while recording.

Provide default parameter values in the shared steps work item and provide different data in the test case for multiple iterations.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"I just read the story of a boy falsely accused of rape. The girl later dropped the case. I am a mother of three boys. All teenagers. They are the best things in my life. For this “selfish” reason, stories like this break my my heart.

One of my greatest future fears is that they will meet the wrong girl. A girl who is vindictive and who has the ability to accuse them of something they didn’t do. I speak as a mother and I will speak this as it bothers me.

Back in the day when I was growing up and abstinence was still a virtue, it was harder for rape accusations to happen. These days, anyone can accuse anyone of rape. Rape accusations has been weaponised and this is scary.

When we actually think of it, the weaponization of rape accusations hurts everyone. It hurts the cases of women who actually are raped cos only close friends and die hard women supporters will take the women’s word for it.

It hurts the men. Who have to live in fear and not get into relationships because they can’t tell what would happen if a relationship goes sour. This is turn hurts the women who will be looking for the good men who have been scared of from dating.

It hurts society cos men and women cannot just meet and be friends without fear. I have told my boys: never be alone in a room with a lady for any reason except she is your wife. You think this is extreme?

As I type this I am literally shaking from reading that boy’s story. I can’t imagine what he and his family had to go through. As long as false rape accusations exist, men need to find ways of protecting themselves too.

Even when you are dating a girl, better to have a chaperone. If you are going to marry her, you will have as much sex as you want. If you aren’t going to marry her the “hit and run” is not worth the pains or possible jail time.

And please please please, don’t be so inebriated as to not even remember what happened. *sigh. Please be careful out there.

My access to Dreamhost over the last several years has primarily involved digging up my credentials logging in and changing the expiration data and CCV on my billing card to keep the account alive for the ancient things that run there… like this blog, and the old photo gallery, before Amazon Photos, and before Flickr was on my radar, and whatever other latest sites the cool kids use for photo management (I still haven’t found a system I like…)

Anyway digging into an app that I configured more than a decade ago on a hosting provider that I haven’t used much in almost that long has proven interesting, it also lead down the rabbits hole of looking at old blog posts.

Attempting to run Linux and MIPS and Sparc hardware for fun?

Anyway back to trying to figure out Gallery’s db connection issues, if I can’t get it working shortly though, I’ll leave it and come back maybe tomorrow, maybe six months from now…",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Bars & nightlife

Kuala Lumpur has a vibrant nightlife, which may be surprising to some as the city is the capital of a Muslim-majority country. But KL offers something to suit all tastes once the sun dips, from low-key neighbourhood pubs through to cutting-edge clubs. Whatever kind of place rocks your boat, a near-universal feature is how relaxed and friendly everything is. It's refreshingly easy in KL for... Read our full review of Nightlife in KL.

One of the biggest complaints about Kuala Lumpur, from both visitors and residents alike, is the shocking price of alcohol. It is often more expensive to get a drink in KL than in notoriously expensive cities like London and New York (and er, islands like Bali). Hefty government taxes are partly to blame, but many bars and restaurants contribute to the problem by having extremely high mark-ups.... Read our full review of Happy hours and other ways to get cheap(er) drinks in Kuala Lumpur.

As Kuala Lumpur grows ever upwards, one of the benefits is an increasing number of rooftop bars where you can get spectacular views of the city. For the most part these are based in high end hotels, making for a mixed clientele of well-heeled locals, expats and visitors. The dress code tends towards “smart casual”, so no sandals, shorts or vests for... Read our full review of Best rooftop bars in Kuala Lumpur.

Cafes

With a red and black exterior and a patio occupied to the brim during lunch, Antipodean Cafe on Kuala Lumpur‘s trendy Jalan Telawi is one of Bangsar’s most successful lunch and coffeehouses (though they’re open for dinner too). Drawing inspiration from the taste and lifestyle of the Antipodes to the south, its extensive menu is locally sourced as much as possible and includes classics as... Read our full review of The Antipodean.

If anywhere in KL can claim to have a burgeoning cafe culture it is Bangsar, particularly the area centred on Jalan Telawi and on the upper floor of Bangsar Village II is where you'll find Marmalade -- one of KL's most charming eateries. It serves up an imaginative selection of breakfasts, salads, sandwiches and pasta dishes. The kids menu helps cement its popularity amongst local yummy... Read our full review of Marmalade.

The cafe serves up light-ish food, such as quiches, pies and salads. The selection may be on the small side, but the portions are generous. Staff can be charming or snotty, depending one side of the bed they go out of. Somewhat difficult to find, it's tucked away in the corner of Peter Hoe Evolution, KL's funkiest shop, on the second floor of the Lee Rubber Building.
The closest public... Read our full review of Peter Hoe Cafe.

When I first came to Kuala Lumpur, a workmate of mine offered to take me to their favourite Chinese eatery. I readily accepted the offer, but as we entered the place, I began to have second thoughts. Our “restaurant” was a collection of plastic tables and stools, located inside a car park. Once the food arrived though, my doubts evaporated. This was seriously good stuff — Chinese food with... Read our full review of An introduction to Chinese coffee shops in Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysia is one of the few places I can think of that has a deeply ingrained culture of both tea and coffee drinking. For the most part, coffee (like tea come to think of it) is served up strong, milky and sweet; an anti-skinny decaff latte if you like. The quality is higher at traditional Malaysian cafes known as kopitiams, which were once common in Kuala Lumpur, but are now an endangered... Read our full review of Where to get a good cup of coffee in Kuala Lumpur.

Tea drinking has been part of Malaysian life for hundreds of years, although exactly when the habit started is unclear. The most likely explanation is that it was brought to the country by traders from China. The word for tea in Malay is teh, derived from Hokkien, the dialect spoken in the Chinese province of Fujian, and by many Malaysian Chinese. Confusingly enough, in Kuala Lumpur, the most... Read our full review of Drinking and buying tea in Kuala Lumpur.

Forget the decor, this eatery is all about the food, which has kept it popular for half a century. While the language and lack of menu are a bit of a headache, it is well worth making the extra effort to enjoy their stand-out dishes including the crispy sweet and sour fish and belly pork.
If in doubt, ask for help from your fellow diners. For character, opt for the older bulding, for air-con,... Read our full review of Sek Yuen.

Its intimate, stylish Bangsar branch, serves a selection of decent thin-crust pizzas and Asian favourites, such as mee siam (Thai style fried noodles), and has a commendable wine list, but it's the desserts which set pulses racing. The pavlova and tiramisu are just two of the shockingly good options. Be warned though, such pleasure does not come cheap -- a dessert and a soft drink will set you... Read our full review of Alexis.

It's part of the BIG Group launched in 2011 by Benjamin Yong, a man with a seeming Midas touch when it comes to food. When it opened, Plan B focused on breakfasts, light pasta dishes, salads and sandwiches, but has now introduced an evening menu too. Prices are very reasonable, and wine bought from the nearby Ben's General Store does not attract a corkage charge.
Bangsar Village is a twenty... Read our full review of Plan B.

Coliseum has been serving food and drink for more than 90 years and while the mostly Western-style food may not hit any great heights, and the service is nothing to shout about, the place is soaked in history, and well worth at least one visit.
Coliseum is on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman about half way (as the crow flies) between Masjid Jemak and Bandaraya LRTs. If you're walking from Masjid... Read our full review of Coliseum Cafe.

Chinese

The steamed meat dumplings are delicious, as are many of the more unusual dishes, such as the noodles mixed with sesame and peanut, and pumpkin with salted duck eggs.
Din Tai Fung has several clearly-marked vegetarian dishes, and is happy to adapt dishes where posssible. It's best to go with at least one other person, so you can smaple a good range of the flavours and textures on offer.... Read our full review of Din Tai Fung.

Worth the visit for its chicken wings alone, it is does superb seafood dishes, like chilli prawns and black pepper crab. The English menu and a willingness to adapt dishes to your taste or dietery needs are other bonuses. Wong Ah Wah's popularity means it has no need to lure in customers with menu-waving waiters, unlike many of its rivals along Jalan Alor. It's open from late afternoon until the... Read our full review of Wong Ah Wah.

One of the finest options is Li Yen in the Ritz Carlton. It is renowned for its service, its sumptuous decor and cassic Cantonese cuisine, including top notch dim sum.
Stand-out dishes include the golden prawns (deep fried with shredded yam) and deep fried fish with salt and pepper. While the food is not outrageously priced for the quality on offer, alcohol prices are another matter entirely.... Read our full review of Li Yen.

This place has a door-stopper size picture menu, most with an English description of the dish. Portions are large, so if you want to sample a a selection of different offerings, best to go in a group. Solo diners are better off opting for good value single plate meals.
Set at the far southern end of Chinatown on Jalan Panggong, the closest monorail station to Wan Fo Yuan is... Read our full review of Wan Fo Yuan.

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong, near to Sze Wa Taoist temple, is well worth popping into if you are in the neighbourhood. The restaurant feels a little like a mini food market as there are a bunch of stalls around the perimeter, each preparing a specific dish. Prices are clearly displayed and you pay as soon as the food arrives. Kedai Kopi Lai Foong is especially well known for its beef noodle soup and... Read our full review of Kedai Kopi Lai Foong.

One of the few proper Chinese coffee shops left in central KL, the decor does not seem to have changed for decades. Or some of the customers for that matter. During the day, you order food from the various stalls, while someone will come to your table to take drinks orders.
Favourites here include char siew (Cantonese barbecued pork), and curry mee (noodle) soup. Zhing Hong has a good... Read our full review of Restoran Zhing Kong.

Yut Kee is a Kuala Lumpur culinary institution, although sadly not one many visitors will have heard of. It’s been serving up tasty food and drink for 83 years, making it one of the city’s very oldest eateries. In that time, this traditional Chinese coffee shop has survived a world war, several recessions, umpteen floods, the communal violence of 1969, and until now, the relentless march of... Read our full review of Yut Kee Restaurant.

Known as century eggs, hundred-year eggs, millennium eggs or pidan, this Chinese delicacy is not as old as its name suggests but might take that long to work up the courage to eat. If you can get over the pungent smell and its odd colour, its a popular dish in Malaysia that you might find yourself... Read our full review of Century eggs.

Ming Tien in Taman Megah is one outdoor food court you shouldn’t miss trying out in Kuala Lumpur. Festooned with coloured lights, wooden huts and trees, Ming Tien is an affordable but popular location to taste local dishes once the sun... Read our full review of Ming Tien Food Court.

Dim sum is a Cantonese custom that you can enjoy at various locations throughout Kuala Lumpur. Dim Sum, literally translated as “to touch your heart,” originated in the teahouses of China but this charming way of dining has made inroads into most parts of Asia and has become part of the culture in Malaysia and beyond. Although it was originally considered inappropriate to enjoy a cup of tea... Read our full review of Dim sum in Kuala Lumpur.

Familiar with Cantonese cuisine? It’s more than just dim sum, with roast duck being an institution all of its own. In London, the Four Seasons’ roast duck restaurant has become famous, particularly in Cantonese circles, for being the best outside of Hong Kong. Now two siblings who worked for eight years in the London Bayswater establishment along with other ex-London based relatives have... Read our full review of Village Roast Duck.

With a large Chinese population in Malaysia, it comes as no surprise that many prized dishes from China have become commonplace. Some of them are just too good to miss, like Beijing’s famous duck dish, Peking... Read our full review of Peking duck in Kuala Lumpur.

Dragon-i has two main specialities, Shanghainese la mian (pulled noodles), which you can see prepared in the open kitchen area, and xiao long bao (steamed dumplings). But the menu it is filled with tasty treats, none of which is likely to break the bank. The braised pork belly, and salt and pepper bean curd are both recommended. Dragon-i wins bonus points for having several clearly-marked... Read our full review of Dragon-i.

Fine dining

French chef Nathalie Arbefeuille has taken the KL fine dining scene by storm over the last few years, with her mix of classic Franco-Italian cuisine and more innovative European/Asian fusion dishes. Of her two KL restaurants, the most convenient for visitors is Cuisine Gourmet by Nathalie.
Her cooking is deceptively simple, forgoing flashiness, to turn out satisfying dishes like foie gras... Read our full review of Cuisine Gourmet by Nathalie.

The weekday three course set lunch costs just 100 ringgit, for some of KL's very best food. Dishes like chicken consomme with black truffle and foie gras terrine; and wagyu beef with roasted eringi (a type of Japanese mushroom), are incredible value for money. The a la carte choices are even more sumptuous. A very nice touch, is that all prices at Sage are quoted nett, so no sneaky plus plus... Read our full review of Sage.

Food courts

Food is a very important draw at these temples to consumerism, split into two distinct types, stand-alone restaurants, and food courts. Every shopping centre has at least one food court, some of the larger ones have several.
They all run on much the same principle though, that you order food from individual outlets, and sit down wherever you can find a free table. This can be somewhat of a... Read our full review of Food courts in KL.

Gastropub

If you are looking for a proper non-halal fried breakfast, with real bacon and pork sausages, then these outlets take a lot of beating. Other highlights include the bangers and mash (sausage and mashed potatoes), burgers and steaks. The sausages are made in house, and are so highly regarded as to be sold in most of the city's best supermarkets. Although very popular with locals, Jarrod's attracts... Read our full review of Jarrod and Rawlins.

Named after the ancient name for Britain, the menu would not be out of place in London, where the two owners (one British, one Malaysian) learnt their trade. Albion KL serves up a mixture of British classics with a twist, such as beer battered fish and chips, as well as more global offerings, like gravadlax (Swedish-style cured salmon).
The express lunch deal, offering three courses for... Read our full review of Albion KL.

Wild mushroom risotto (slow cooked Italian rice), with oyster mushroom tempura, is just one of the imaginative offerings. But the menu has simpler non-fusion fare too, such as the steak sandwich. As an added bonus, vegetarians are well catered for.
Although not cheap, a starter, main course and dessert should still leave change from 100 ringgit. The ground floor has the feel of an upmarket... Read our full review of Twentyone Kitchen and Bar.

It has nine different choices of battered fish, including classics like cod, and more unusual options such as parrot fish. The barramundi is a good option. Away from fish & chips, the hearty pies are also recommended, particularly the steak and Guinness.
For a true taste of home, assuming you come from the north of England that is, the chips with curry sauce are a must. Prices are moderate to... Read our full review of The Magnificent Fish and Chips Bar.

Indian

The Indian dining experience does not get much more sumptuous (or over the top) than at Bombay Palace, set in colonial bungalow on the edge of KLCC. It's on the pricey side, especially if you order wine, but the food is reliably good. Stand-out dishes include the butter chicken (creamy chicken curry) and the palak paneer.
Bombay Palace is at 215 Jalan Tun Razak, just to the north of the Royal... Read our full review of Bombay Palace.

Nagasari is a bit unusual in other ways too. Although it looks like a Mamak shop, and opens nearly as long hours, its menu is a mix of south and north Indian dishes, including banana leaf (12:00-15:00), tandoori chicken and aloo capsicum (potatoes and sweet pepper curry), all done to the same high standards. It also has a stall serving Chinese vegetarian food at lunchtime, and another one,... Read our full review of Nagasari Curry House.

If there is one local food experience which should be tried at least once by every visitor to KL, it is the banana leak curry. At its most basic, this meal consists of rice, south Indian curries, salads and chutneys, served on a banana leaf, all for 5-6 ringgit.
What sets Devi's apart, is not just the quality of the basic selection, but also the range of curry sauces to slop over your rice... Read our full review of Devi's Corner.

Named after nasi kandar, originally a Penang favourite of steamed rice served with a selection of dishes, but now mostly associated with Malaysian Indian Muslims (Mamaks). Other popular offerings include a wide selection of South Indian breads, ketam masala (stewed crab with curry sauce), burung puyuh (fried quail) and ayam kampung goreng (crispy fried chicken).
If you're finding mall eating... Read our full review of Nasi Kandar Pelita.

One of the undoubted culinary highlights of Kuala Lumpur is south Indian food, done with a distinctive Malaysian twist. The eateries can be divided into two main categories: those run by Hindus, and those run by Indians who have converted to Islam, known as Mamaks. Although many dishes turn up at both types of establishment, distinctive differences do exist between... Read our full review of South Indian food in Kuala Lumpur.

A short hop from the Liza De Inn Hotel, you’ll find Kanna Curry House in Section 17, a residential part of Petaling Jaya. With a modest but clean interior and a simple outdoor section with plastic tables and chairs, it may look like any other south Indian joint in Kuala Lumpur. But appearances are not what’s driven this restaurant’s popularity; its banana leaf, on the other hand, has helped... Read our full review of Kanna Curry House.

South Indian restaurants are far more the norm in Kuala Lumpur, but flamboyant Sagar in Bangsar, a 15-minute cab ride from the city centre, offers a wide selection of northern Indian specialties, such as tandoori chicken, rogan gosh and chicken biryani. Vegetarians aren’t forgotten either, with a long list of dishes that’ll suit even the most hardcore vegan’s... Read our full review of Sagar.

A plate of rice topped with four different curries for breakfast? Sounds like a handful (or rather plateful) but that’s exactly what nasi kandar is about; a combination of tantalising, distinct flavours. Once you get used to the idea of consuming so many carbs and so much spice so early in the day, I guarantee you’ll be fighting for a plate of this truly Malaysian dish on... Read our full review of Nasi Kandar.

Now in it's third and largest incarnation in the area over the last five years, it finally looks to have found a long-term home.
Part of a small local chain, SK Corner offers all the classics, including roti canai (fluffy flat bread with curry saunce), tosai (thin savoury pancake, usually served with curry sauces and chutneys), Mamak mee (spicy fried noodles), ayam goreng (fried chicken),... Read our full review of Restoran SK Corner.

The deep fried bitter gourd is worth the trip to this Bangsar outlet almost by itself. Popular extras, like the ikan goreng (fried fish coated in spices), and vegetarian chicken curry, are cheap and tasty too. As an added bonus, Sri Nirwana serves banana leaf all day and all night -- at most other places it is a lunch-time treat only.
Bangsar Village is a twenty minute walk (or five minute... Read our full review of Sri Nirwana Maju.

Introduction

Malay & Nyonya

It serves up most of the Malay classics, including otak otak (steamed seafood mousse wrapped in a green leaf), rendang (slow cooked dry meat curry), and ayam percik (chargrilled marinated chicken).
Bijan may not be cheap (the least expensive main course is 30 ringgit), but it does represent reasonable value for money. Unusually for Malay cuisine it can be washed down with a glass of beer or... Read our full review of Bijan.

The menu includes a good selection of Malay classics, with some Indonesian ones thrown in for good measure. Recommended dishes include the sup ekor (oxtail soup), sambal tumis udang (prawns in a sour spicy sauce), and the kambing masak merah (slow-cooked marinated lamb shank).
A nice touch is the mini-tasting menus, which give diners the chance to sample a selection of dishes, such as prawns... Read our full review of Enak KL.

Kuala Lumpur is not so much the city that never sleeps, as the city that never stops eating. To say that the city’s residents like their food is a serious understatement. They are obsessed with it. Day to day life is planned around meals, not the other way... Read our full review of Eating around the clock in KL.

Every year, Kuala Lumpur plays host to a global halal conference, an indication of how important the Malaysian government views the international market for products that comply with Islamic rules. The event covers everything from food to financial services, which probably comes as a bit of a surprise to anyone who thinks the term only refers to the way an animal is slaughtered. So what does... Read our full review of Halal and Haram (Haraam) in Kuala Lumpur.

The two main centres of Nyonya cooking are Penang, where Thai influences also feature, and Melaka, where Portuguese and Indonesian cuisines form part of the mix.
The Old China Cafe explores these disparate influences to the full, serving up dishes such as gulai kepala ikan (fish head curry) and ayam cincalok (chicken with preserved shrimp). It's worth a visit for the historic shophouse alone... Read our full review of Old China Cafe.

A good way to start your meal is with the selection of appetisers, which includes popiah goreng (fried spring rolls) and cucur udang (deep fried battered prawns). Other recommended dishes include the ikan siakap masam manis (deep fried sweet and sour sea bass) and ayam panggang kuah percik (chargrilled marinated chicken).
Songket has the bonus (or curse) of live traditional entertainment... Read our full review of Songket.

Makan Kitchen not only tries to show off this regional variety, it also showcases some of Malaysia's non-Malay cuisines, including Indian, Chinese, Nyonya (Malay-Chinese), Ibanese (from the Iban people of Sarawak), and Kristang (Portuguese-Malakan). It's possible to order a la carte, or as a sort of buffet (59-79 ringgit, where you choose a selection of dishes, and it's cooked freshly for you).... Read our full review of Makan Kitchen.

Markets

As I may have mentioned before, Malaysians like their food. It’s one of the few things which cuts across all the main ethnic groups in the country. One big difference between the races though, is that while fantastic Chinese and Indian food is easily accessible to tourists, good Malay cooking is far more difficult to... Read our full review of Ramadan food markets in Kuala Lumpur.

Close to where Kuala Lumpur began in 1857 is a traffic-clogged square called Pasar Medan — literally, “market field” in Malay. It was here that the city’s pioneering tin miners bought their fresh supplies, and around which the early settlement too shape. In the late 19th century, the market was moved to a new site a few hundred metres away, where Central Market now... Read our full review of The best fresh food markets in Kuala Lumpur.

Middle Eastern

The large range of hot and cold meze, and excellent Lebanese bread sandwiches, mostly priced in the 10-15 ringgit mark, all make for high quality, decent value snacks. The same could not be said of its alcohol prices though, which are cheeky to say the least.
Al-Amar's big brother, in Pavilion, is a much more formal, and thus pricier affair, turning out what many people believe to be the best... Read our full review of Al-Amar.

The food, which is described as Arabian, is not only reliably good, but also the best value Middle Eastern cuisine in town. As well as a good range of meze, and grilled meat and fish dishes, Sahara Tent has some more esoteric offerings, like Arayess (lamb stuffed bread), and fried breaded fish fillet on a bed of hummus.
Sahara Tent is a five minute walk from Bukit Bintang monorail... Read our full review of Sahara Tent.

One such place is Naab, which specialises in Iranian fare. While most of the dishes would not look out of place on a Lebanese menu, such as the various kebabs, dolma (vine leaves stuffed with herby rice) and hummus, Naab has a sprinkling of more unusual offerings. These include lamb shank with broad bean rice and ghorme sabzi, a traditional Iranian beef stew.
Naab is good value for money,... Read our full review of Naab.

Tarbush is part of a small local chain but don't let that put you off. The sharing plates of meze (mostly vegetarian appetisers), served with warm flat bread, make for tasty meals in themselves. These include some of the best hummus (chickpea and sesame paste dip) in town, as well as baba ghanoush (smoky aubergine dip), falafel (deep fried chickpea patties) and fattoush (mixed salad topped by... Read our full review of Tarbush.

Though strictly speaking not part of the Middle East, Turkish cuisine shares many of the same dishes. What makes Bosphorus special though, is the offerings which are more particular to Turkey, including imam bayaldi (baked stuffed aubergine), cacik (yoghurt and garlic dip), lahmacun (Turkish lamb pizza), and hunkar begendi (literally the Sultan's favourite, slow cooked lamb served on aubergine... Read our full review of Bosphorus.

Other Asian cuisine

Apart from the well-executed standards, there are also a number of more unusual dishes, such chor ladda (chicken and peanut dumplings) and Yam Hua Plee (banana flower and minced chicken salad), many from the Isaan region of Thailand. Rama V wins further points for having an interesting vegetarian menu.
Rama V is on the south side of Jalan U-Thant, which runs off to the east of Jalan Tun... Read our full review of Rama V Fine Thai Cuisine.

Forget the stained/torn table cloths, and the wobbly tables, and concentrate on the food. The green curries are wonderfully spicy and flavoursome, while the som tam (spicy papaya salad), and pad Thai (sour sweet fried flat noodles), are great too.
Considering its convenient location, at the Jalan Alor end of Changkat Bukit Bintang, and the reasonable prices, this place is a true rough... Read our full review of Restoran Thai Somtam Seafood.

What sets Samira apart from many of its rivals, is that the food has not been altered too much for local tastes. This is proper Thai (and Laotian) fare, with favourites like tom kha (spicy cocount milk soup), and pad thai (sour sweet rice noodles), done reliably well.
Samira has several vegetarian options and is happy to adapt dishes where possible. It's hidden away in Sentul Park, on the... Read our full review of Samira by Asian Terrace.

The two conveniently placed KL outlets (one in Equatorial, the other in Pavilion), are both reliably good places to find authentic cuisine. It is the simple things which Kampachi does well, such as the california rolls (meat, fish or vegetables, wrapped in rice), soba (buckwheat noodle) soup, shioyaki (salt baked fish), and bento (assorted goodies served in a multi-compartment tray).
You'll... Read our full review of Kampachi.

Seafood

Whether you’re seeking a quick culinary expedition or just looking for a new place to visit for a day from Kuala Lumpur, Port Klang is easily accessible and allows you to combine filling your stomach with the discovery of a new location. Relatively unknown by foreigners, Port Klang’s crab and steamboat dishes are highly sought after by tourists visiting from Singapore and other parts of... Read our full review of Seafood in Port Klang.

Fatty Crab is a name on Kuala Lumpur‘s seafood circuit that any self-respecting seafood lover ought to know. It’s impossible to miss with the crowds waiting outside to dine here; even with two floors of seating, you may need to wait more than an hour on weekends for a table. The best strategy is to either go early (before 20:00), late (after 21:30), or dine here on weekdays when the throngs... Read our full review of Fatty Crab.

Anyone up for some fresh seafood in Kuala Lumpur? If heading for the coast is too time-consuming and inconvenient, then this is the place for you in Kuala Lumpur: Unique Seafood is 15 minutes from the city centre by cab and you’ll find more than a hundred fish tanks filled with fresh seafood imported from all over the world, including some rather unique specimens. From abalone and geoduck, to... Read our full review of Unique Seafood 23.

Vegetarian

As well as the lunch-time mixed rice section, it's a great spot to try Chinese and Nyonya dishes which are usually off-limits. The curry mee (thick curry noodle soup), asam laksa (sour spicy soup) and the char kuay teow (spicy fried flat noodles) are particularly good. As with every other vegetarian eatery in town, no alcohol is served.
Blue Boy is just off Jalan Tong Shin a 20-30 minute walk... Read our full review of Blue Boy.

Apart from breads, which are ordered from the waiting staff, the rest of the food is served as a buffet. As many of the dishes, which change every day, are cooked to old family recipes, Annalakshmi is a genuine culinary voyage of discovery. Whatever you choose to pay (15-20 ringgit a head is reasonable), the money goes to a good cause, helping to fund the Temple of Fine Arts.
Annalakshmi is... Read our full review of Annalakshmi.

The cafe is owned by Artisan Roast, purveyor of some of the city's finest coffee. So you can rest assured that you can get a quality caffeine fix to go with your vegetarian and vegan food. As well as savoury snacks, are sweet pastries and ice cream. The only disappointing feature is the lack of decaf coffee.
You'll find RAW Coffee on the ground floor of the Wisma Equity Building on the north... Read our full review of RAW Coffee Kuala Lumpur.

This popular eatery does a range of good value thalis thalis (a selection of dishes normally served on a round stainless steel plate), from various regions of India. A la carte choices include south Indian treats like masala tosai (savoury pancake with spicy potato filling), as well as north Indian favourites like sag paneer (cottage cheese cubes with spinach). While the decor won't win any... Read our full review of Bakti Woodlands.

Horror, pity and grudging admiration: the three main ways Malaysians react when they find out someone is a vegetarian. This would suggest that keeping clear of meat and fish is a tough ask, even in cosmopolitan KL. Which is odd, because there are few places in the world where vegetarians can eat as well.... Read our full review of How to eat vegetarian in Kuala Lumpur.

Saravana Bhavan, which has convenient outlets in Bangsar, Brickfields and Little India, turns out some of the city's best Indian food, all of it vegetarian. Top picks include the superb masala tosai (savoury pancake stuffed with a spicy potato and onion mix), aloo gobi masala (potato and cauliflower curry) and paneer butter masala (cubes of Indian cottage cheese in a rich tomato sauce).... Read our full review of Saravana Bhavan.

Western

Set on the edge of the embassy district, this place is a triumph of substance over style. Forget the plastic furniture, neon lighting, and traffic noise, steaks of this quality, for under 30 ringgit, are worth travelling miles for. The mixed clientele includes plenty of diplomats, who generally know a thing or two when it comes to food. Cold beer is available by the can.
Suzi's Corner can be... Read our full review of Suzi's Corner.

Promising to burger you senseless, Daily Grind has a wide range of burgers to choose from, including two vegetarian options, although the classic beef burger with cheese is hard to beat. Most are in the 30-40 ringgit bracket, so not exactly cheap, but for the taste and quality, it's really not bad value.
Bangsar Village is a twenty minute walk (or five minute cab ride) from Bangsar LRT on the... Read our full review of The Daily Grind.

Named after a frangipani which unfortunately no longer stands out front, the restaurant pulls off the fusion trick, marrying European and Asian cuisines, to make an end result which is greater than the sum of parts. Dishes like the strudel of seared foie gras and apple rendang (unlike the Malaysian dry curry, this is a fried fruit reduction) may sound like a dog's dinner, but are actually very... Read our full review of Frangipani.

Although named after the Spanish for pig, this place is run by an Austrian, and turns out dishes from all over Europe. Thuringer tostbratwurst (sausage with pickled cabbage and mashed potato), may sit uneasily with pan-fired goats cheese wrapped in Serrano ham, but El Cerdo's legion of loyal customers attest to the quality of the food. Despite the rustic nature of the menu, this is not a cheap... Read our full review of El Cerdo.

Quite apart from having a great range of authentic tapas, cold cuts, and main meals, El Meson is the unlikely home to one of KL's best fried breakfasts, with real bacon and pork sausages. Unlikely, because most Spaniards (like Italians) start the day with nothing more substantial than a coffee. The rest of the menu, however, could hardly be more evocative of Spain.
Bangsar Village is a twenty... Read our full review of El Meson.

A favourite amongst expats and well-heeled locals alike, this is a great place for a treat Italian meal while visiting KL. Although by no means cheap, Sassorosso is not outrageously priced, so long as you stick to pizzas and pasta, and avoid the temptations of the extensive wine list. It also does a great value lunchtime deal, with an antipasti buffet, and pizza or pasta, for little more than 50... Read our full review of Sassorosso.

While it is relatively easy to get good Spanish food in Kuala Lumpur, the most prominent local chain, La Bodega, lets itself down by being pork-free. Spanish food without the likes of jamon (ham) and chorizo (spicy pork sausage), is simply not the same. That said, La Bodega is still one of the best places in town for tapas.
The most accessible branch is Bodega @Pavilion KL, which, while being... Read our full review of La Bodega.

With a diverse multiracial society and an evolving food culture, there’s no doubt that diners are spoilt for choice in Malaysia.

Dishes like lamb shank with soft polenta (cornmeal), roast sea bass with grilled vegetables, and pumpkin ravioli with duck breast, are great examples of less being more. The pizza is good too, although it's best to go for the more classic options, such as funghi (mushroom) or quattro formagi (four cheeses).

It is an undeniably pleasant setting -- one of KL's very best spots for a romantic date. And the food is generally decent too, especially the pizzas. But the use of pork substitutes, like beef bacon and turkey ham, is somewhat less classy than the decor. Where possible stick to simpler combinations, with real Italian ingredients, such as the gnocchi (potato dumplings) with gorgonzola and rocket;...

[7] Steiker and Steiker never suggest that any of these goals are viewed by the Court as more important than any other, and in fact may suggest at one point that minimizing underinclusion is in fact the Court's primary goal: ""Each of the three concerns or commitments (desert, fairness, and individualization) reflects different facets of the basic norm of equal treatment, the idea that like cases should be treated alike."" Id. at 369.

[8] In this context, as in most others, it is dangerous to view ""the Court"" as an entity with a single mind, when in fact it is composed of nine members who often have diametrically opposed opinions. As to the death penalty, as Steiker and Steiker point out, ""the basic configuration on Eighth Amendment issues remained constant for two decades after Furman: two unwavering poles competed for the center."" Id. at 428 (citing Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972)). On one pole were former Justices Brennan and Marshall, who advocated complete abolition of the death penalty. See id. at 427. On the other pole were former Chief Justice Burger and current Chief Justice Rehnquist (joined in more recent days by Justices Scalia and Thomas), who oppose significant regulation of the death penalty through the Eighth Amendment. See id. It was thus the remaining ""centrist"" justices like Blackmun (until late in his career, when he became a virtual abolitionist), O'Connor, Powell, Stevens, and White, whose votes controlled the outcomes of cases. See id. at 428. Thus, when I refer to ""the Court,"" I am referring to that centrist bloc as augmented by whatever votes they could pull from the two poles on particular issues. Despite the cobbled-together nature of this body of doctrine, Steiker and Steiker acknowledge that the Court has promulgated some consistent themes, see id. at 364, and I agree (although I do not agree with Steiker and Steiker concerning what all those themes are).

[74] Death penalty cases, if properly defended, cost a great deal more than other murder cases at virtually every stage, from voir dire through sentencing.

In a civil suit between two private parties for money damages, for example, we view it as no more serious in general for there to be an erroneous verdict in the defendant's favor than for there to be an erroneous verdict in the plaintiff's favor . . . . In a criminal case, on the other hand, we do not view the social disutility of convicting an innocent man as equivalent to the disutility of acquitting someone who is guilty . . . . I view the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case as bottomed on a fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free.

[79] The Court found the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof to be constitutionally required in In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). As to the supermajority requirement, the Constitution requires unanimity for conviction by a six-person jury. See Burch v. Louisiana, 441 U.S. 130, 138 (1979). As to a twelve-person jury, the Court has upheld a nine-to-three verdict in favor of conviction. See Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 362-63 (1972). However, the Court probably would not approve any lesser supermajority. Johnson was a five-to-four decision, and one of the five members of the majority, Justice Blackmun, stated in his concurrence that any lesser number of votes for conviction would cause him ""great difficulty.""

Muller, The Virtue of Mercy in Criminal Sentencing, 24 SETON HALL L. REV. 288, 335 (1993):

Mercy . . . is an attitude that the sentencer adopts, during the process of selecting a sentence from within a range of authorized punishments, by imagining both the nature of the criminal episode and the impact of the possible sentences from the defendant's perspective. Mercy reminds the judge of how things look from the defense table. Mercy's role in the sentencing process is therefore a limiting or restraining one; it provides a check against the risk that the sentencer will get things wrong by describing the nature of the crime in an imbalanced way or underestimating the impact of the sentence on the defendant.

See also Paul Whitlock Cobb, Jr., Note, Reviving Mercy in the Structure of Capital Punishment, 99 YALE L.J. 389, 391 (1989) (arguing that mercy is a particular virtue in capital sentencing). But see California v.

In comparing post- Furman death sentencing rates among the states, it is worth noting that the states whose statutes require death sentencing by the judge rather than by the jury tend to have the highest rates in the region (e.g., Indiana in the East North Central region, Florida in the South Atlantic region, Alabama in the East South Central region, and Arizona and Idaho in the Mountain region).

Id.; see also Harris v. Alabama, 115 S. Ct. 1031, 1036 (1995) (noting that according to statistics compiled by the Alabama Prison Project, there have been only five cases in Alabama in which the judge rejected an advisory verdict of death and instead imposed life imprisonment, compared to 47 instances where the judge imposed a death sentence over a jury recommendation of life imprisonment); Stephen B.

[107] The Court upheld sentencing by a one-person sentencer when it refused to find sentencing by the trial judge unconstitutional in Proffitt v.Florida, 428 U.S. 242, 259-60 (1976). The extent to which the Court might permit a death sentence to be imposed by a nonunanimous jury has never been tested, because all states with jury sentencing require a unanimous verdict. The Court has not yet decided whether a unanimous verdict is required at the guilt phase of a case in which the death sentence may be sought upon conviction. See Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S. 624, 630 (1991). The Court also has not required that the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard be employed during capital sentencing, as is evidenced by the Court's upholding of state schemes that do not embody that requirement. Seesupra notes 82, 85, 92-93 and accompanying text (states not employing the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in capital sentencing).

[143] See Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978).

[T]he Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments require that the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital case, not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.

[C]ontemporary death penalty law is remarkably undemanding. The narrowing, channeling, and individualization requirements can be simultaneously and completely satisfied by a statute that defines capital murder as any murder accompanied by some additional, objective factor or factors and that provides for a sentencing proceeding in which the sentencer is asked simply whether the defendant should live or die.

[T]he narrowing function required for a regime of capital punishment may be provided in either of these two ways: The legislature may itself narrow the definition of capital offenses, as Texas and Louisiana have done, so that the jury finding of guilty responds to this concern, or the legislature may more broadly define capital offenses and provide for narrowing by jury findings of aggravating circumstances at the penalty phase.

[183] In light of this statistic, it is possible to argue that the Court overreacted in Furman. However, there are important aspects of the world as seen by the Court in 1972 that are not reflected by this statistic. First, this statistic does not include cases that came before the Court from Georgia in which the defendants had been sentenced to death for rape or armed robbery, two crimes as to which the Court later determined that the death penalty was overinclusive as a matter of law. See Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 584, 597 (1977); Hooks v. Georgia, 433 U.S. 917, 917 (1977). Second, it took quite a lot of legwork for the Baldus group to dig out the information that enabled them to determine just how aggravated each case was. The lack of a meaningful sentencing proceeding in Georgia prior to 1972 means that the Court did not have access to this information—the Georgia system from the Court's perspective must have resembled a ""black box"" from which defendants' names were pulled seemingly at random. Third, this statistic does not reflect the seemingly disproportionate number of African-Americans sentenced to death, particularly for rapes of white women. See supra note 128 and accompanying text.

State, 455 S.E.2d 27 (Ga. 1995), because the Georgia Supreme Court found that the trial court may have improperly excluded the co-defendant's confession—in which the co-defendant took major responsibility for the killing—and reversed the conviction. See id. at 30. Although this evidence was admitted at the sentencing phase, the failure to admit it at the guilt phase could have undermined the validity of the jury's verdict at the guilt phase. The second case I excluded was Potts v. State, 410 S.E.2d 89 (Ga. 1991). This case involved a kidnapping and murder that occurred in 1981, but took almost a decade to reach the Georgia Supreme Court. I excluded this case because the crime was not committed during the same time frame as the other cases I examined. I replaced these two cases with the next two cases in reverse chronological order.

The mitigating factors were: Defendant showed remorse, gave self up within 24 hours, was drunk or had a history of drug or alcohol abuse, had no intent to kill, believed he or she had a moral justification, the victim was a fugitive, provoked or aroused defendant, was drinking, or using drugs or had bad blood with defendant.

[221] See id. at 686 n.92 (""The minor aggravating factors were: A race-related motive, victim was drowned, defendant resisted arrest, defendant created a great risk in a public place, or the victim was a hostage or female."").

[222] Specifically, I assumed that the factors included within the Barnett analysis and the BWP analysis continue to identify the basic aggravating and mitigating factors, and continue to directly reflect their relative strength. As BWP explain:

There are two basic approaches to classifying cases as similar or dissimilar—the a priori and the empirical. The a priori approach endeavors to classify cases as similar on the basis of criteria that, from a legal or moral perspective, one believes should govern the appropriate sentence.

. . . .
The empirical approach also begins by presupposing that certain factual characteristics of the case being reviewed can serve to identify other cases of ""similar"" culpability. In contrast to the a priori approach—which primarily selects those factual characteristics on a normative basis—the empirical approach tries to employ those legitimate case characteristics that, statistically, best explain the observed sentencing results . . . . The difference between the two methods is that the a priorist selects the factors he or she believes should influence the sentencing decision, while the empiricist selects the factors that actually appear to do so.
BALDUSETAL., EQUAL JUSTICE, supra note 33, at 47-48. Thus, I am adopting an a priori approach, with my a priori choices being informed by the results of empirical studies.

[227] Barnett reported no cases in this box, but this is clearly a box that should have a high ratio—the ratios in the other boxes where the three Barnett integers totaled ""4"" are .56 and .81.
Return to text.

[228] In this case, the defendant pulled the victim's head back by the hair and shot her in the forehead. If this is not an ""execution-style"" killing (BWP do not define this), then there is no serious aggravating circumstance, and the case scores .00 on the BWP scale. If it is an execution-style killing, then it scores .42.
Return to text.

[229] There were not enough cases in this box in the BWP study (only one, in which a death sentence was not imposed) to form a valid proportion. The boxes on either side had moderate ratios (.40 and .50), but were based upon a small number of cases.

[245] See id. at 56.

We developed a regression-based culpability index for the [study] with a logistic multiple-regression analysis designed to identify statistically the factors that best explain which defendants received death sentences . . . . This procedure required us, first, to collect information for every case concerning a large number of legitimate case characteristics, such as prior record or a contemporaneous felony, that might have influenced the sentencing decision. We then computed for each such case characteristic a regression co-efficient (or 'weight') that reflected its individual contribution to the overall culpability index. Next, we calculated the relative culpability or blameworthiness of each case by summing the 'weights' of all the legitimate explanatory variables present in that case. We then ranked all the cases according to their relative culpability scores, thereby constructing an overall culpability index along which the cases were distributed. Finally, we defined as 'similar' six groups of cases with comparable overall culpability scores.

[258] To me, the most regrettable road not taken by the Court has been its failure to require a heightened level of attorney competence above the relatively minimal standard set for all cases, including death penalty cases, in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984) (requiring that counsel's performance be shown to be deficient and that the deficiency prejudiced the defense in order to reverse a conviction or death sentence). A requirement that states provide super-competent trial counsel would either force states out of the death penalty business due to excessive costs or force states to provide top-notch counsel. Either possibility would be more fair to defendants and more efficient in the long run.

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 20: JEWFISH MOUNTAIN

23:21 - I finally have a moment to myself -- it's been a looong day! We awoke
this morning docked in West End for customs and motored off once we had been
cleared. By late morning we were anchored at Jewfish Mountain for a day of diving.
Gliding around the site were 15-20 Caribbean reef sharks of varying size. Many
were curious juveniles who were more than happy to buzz a dome port for a portrait.
At around 65' there was a beautiful purple tube sponge surrounded by red and
orange sponges, which was perfect for reef portraits of sharks. These were the
sort of shots that Jeremy liked (the rest being ""crap"" :). He paid
me a nice compliment by telling me, ""normally I'm quite rude to photographers
because I don't like their stuff, but I like yours; i like that you naturally
shoot with interesting composition."" I'm finding him to be an interesting
guy. He's only taken two photographs so far. I guess he has enough of these
sorts of shots, having authored three books on sharks.

At one point I tugged on some fish that was sticking out of our bait box and
ended up pulling out a rather large piece by accident. The sharks came *really*
close at that point (as I kicked away from the fish, which I had dropped) and
I was bumped multiple times as they investigated me and my white strobes. My
strobes were given light bites a few times.

I think I have my exposures down now. It's a great feeling knowing that I can
likely get ""the shot,"" should the moment present itself. Having said
that, I utterly failed to shoot any presentable night dolphin shots this evening.
We had some dolphin feeding on flying fish near the boat for a couple of hours,
and a few of us jumped in to play with them. Geoff was in the water for a full
hour in only a t-shirt and trunks! I should have pre-focused my camera, but
instead relied on auto-focus assisted by a bright Hartenberger light to illuminate
the way. I was able to get some good photos using this method last year, but
this time the D60's notoriously poor autofocus mechanism failed to act fast
enough, so I ended up with 40 blurry photos. :( Some of them looked like they
could have been fantastic, had they been in focus. *sigh*

I did get a blurry photo of what looks like a sea snake. I yelled, ""snake!""
when I saw it, but was told by those watching over me from the boat that it
was an eel. Everyone changed their minds when they saw the photo. It's neat
looking (although blurry). Also near was a school of a couple hundred small
squid that kept appearing directly beneath the boat (coming up from the depths
to about 15-20', repeatedly).

I'm having a good time with the Brits and their Brit humor. Earlier, someone
uttered the phrase, ""you could see her tonsils through her rectum.""
You'd probably never hear an American string words together like that. :)

I've retired to my bunk and am typing away here, listening to Vienna Teng
before going to bed. It's impossible for me to do any ""personal"" work
out in the galley because of various distractions. :)

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 21: MOUNT MOKARRAN

12:21 - Hammerhead!! Two great hammerheads (and a beautiful frigate bird) are
circling the boat here at Mount Mokarran. One is probably just over 10', and the
other is said to be about the same size (I just spent 45 minutes with one of them
and didn't see the other one). Anna did a fantastic job wrangling the shark onto
the dive platform, which gave all of us opportunities to get some chomping shots.
He (the shark) was completely unafraid, gliding between us at arm's length.

15:05 - When I splashed back into the water the second time, the hammerhead
whipped around and swam towards me with great purpose. I took a few blurry photos
of him while beating his head lightly with my camera; next time I will be prepared
to take proper photographs while I avoid being investigated too closely.
Anna said that he came at me three times. :)

Down at the bottom there were bull sharks, reef sharks, and lemon sharks wandering
around. Jimmy took some shots of a large pregnant lemon shark covered with remoras.
I should have explored down there a bit more. One or two tiger sharks came in
as well, but they weren't close enough to get photographs of.

22:49 - I was just browsing through some photographs I have here on my computer
from the days just before I left on this trip; it seems strange that the people
in those images are dressed in San Francisco attire, sitting in my place at
a house concert. I sometimes think about how bipolar my life is and wish that
I could just be settled/content sitting at home relaxing. Earlier today Brahms'
c minor piano quartet lodged itself in my head, and memories of performing it
with Livia, Barry, and Fred flashed by. I haven't touched my cello since December
26th. Every time I leave on one of these extended trips, I am away from the
other things that make me happy (friends, playing music, etc.).

But I suppose it is ok, because I shot some fantastic hammerhead pictures today.
:)

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 22: WALKER'S CAY

21:41 - As forecasted, the wind started blowing today. We drove around looking
for calm seas for most of the day, eventually giving up and coming in to dock
at Walker's Cay. Around the shark dive area bull sharks, lemon sharks, and nurse
sharks swimming around close to shore. We're booked to swim with the bull sharks
there at 8am tomorrow morning. The shark scientist Dr. Erich Ritter (the one who
was recently bitten
at the bull shark area) is here as well; he was giving a talk in a side room when
we arrived. A few in our group have some shared history with Dr. Ritter and were
interested in seeing the condition of his leg, but no one mustered up enough momentum
to ask about it. We did, however, talk to the person who drove him away from the
site to be evacuated. It is said that Dr. Ritter kept repeating, ""it was
my fault! it was my fault!"" afterwards.

We've just eaten a wonderful dinner and are now watching ""Blue Water,
White Death,"" a documentary with Ron and Valerie Taylor about early shark
diving.

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 23: WALKER-S CAY

16:24 - The wind is blowing 20-25 knots out of the northwest. We've been confined
to the boat for most of the day, but a few of us did venture out for a blustery
walk around the beautiful beach at the tip of the island. A small airplane left
the smell of burning rubber while landing as we were walking back, and Dr. Erich
Ritter came jogging down the runway -- in shorts. I'm amazed that he is able to
jog with so much damage done to his leg! I won't describe it here, but I will
say that he is lucky to be on his feet.

16:45 - The blokes are all outside trying to bait in a bull shark. John came
inside a few minutes ago carrying a small, hollow, red tube. ""Guess what
was in this tube?"" he asked. Yep. It was the handle to a mop pole. The
rest of the pole -- with around $12K worth of camera gear attached -- had fallen
off and was laying in the sand. Luckily, the water is shallow, and Captain Kurt
managed to fish it out with a large hook. Boys will be boys, I suppose. :) Both
Jimmy and John have been trying to get close-up footage of Bahama Mama (a large
local bull shark) for awhile now.

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 24: DODDSR

16:09 - We left this morning and are now anchored at a site lovingly referred
to as ""Drop Over Dead Dog Snapper Rock."" There are a few Caribbean reef
sharks circling around, and some distance from the anchor line is a grouper spawning
aggregation (at a sandy patch in 110' of water). Many pregnant groupers are there,
along with a large school of Bermuda chubs (also spawning). The school of chubs
followed me while I swam around the sandy area, but the grouper were rather paranoid,
and I was unable to get close to them. The wind is still blowing pretty hard,
and the swell on the surface made it difficult to get back onto the boat.

21:56 - We're anchored at Lilly Bank now, in calm water for the night. In the
morning we return to Mount Mokkaran, the site of our first hammerhead sighting.
All of us are praying for a large tiger shark. :)

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 25: MOUNT OLYMPUS

17:14 - Mount Mokarran was too rough this morning, so we ended up anchoring at
Mount Olympus, a gorgeous reef, by Bahamian standards. It is covered with nice
sea fans and colorful sponges, but unfortunately the visibility was poor (because
of particles in the water and a deep thermocline) so we continued to El Dorado
for the remainder of the afternoon. There are some really large reef sharks at
El Dorado. Jimmy snapped the metal ball off of Anna's Sea & Sea strobe arm mount
during the first dive. Things like mounting balls really should be indestructible!
I don't think my ULCS balls would have been that easy to break off. Anyway, we
tried using the Pasco Fix magic glue that the Austrian guy at the Miami Boat Show
sold us, and the glued-on ball stayed in place for most of the second dive, but
broke again when Anna was adjusting her strobe position. We're going to glue it
again tonight and let it cure all night.

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 26: MOUNT MOKARRAN

22:05 - Two great hammerheads came in today, but neither of them were ""players"".
A small 7' one swam circles around Jeremy and only came up for bait a few times
before disappearing off into the murk. A larger 11-12' one (with disfigured pectoral
fins, Jeremy says. he even drew an illustration for us.) was off further in the
distance, circling the boat. Its dorsal fin was enormous! Jim and Anna have seen
great hammerheads as long as 18', but this 11-12' specimen was the largest one
I have ever seen. I followed it, drifting with the current until I was further
from the boat than I wanted to be. Even though I knew I wasn't in any real danger,
I had to suppress the slight panic that was welling up within me. (Imagine: the
visibility is around 90' or so, but it's a milky view all around. You look up
and scan the brightness above for the tell-tale shadow of the boat, and it is
nowhere to be seen. A large hammerhead is circling just out of sight... :) Although
I don't get ""lost"" that often, it's always like that for me during the
moment I realize that I have no idea where the boat is.

At the bottom 90' below, four bull sharks (two large and two small), a few
reef sharks, and two lemon sharks (one of them was 8-9' long!) patrolled, but
they didn't seem to be as friendly as the sharks we've seen elsewhere. I was
unable to get close enough to any of them to take a decent photo. I did, however,
take a nice photo of the bow of the Shear Water from beneath the water, with
thin ribbons of perfect light streaming downward from around it.

We're anchored here for the night. Jimmy says that there are often tiger sharks
pacing around in the early morning after a night with bait left out. ""I
just hope that if one comes by it isn't big enough to try to eat the crate itself,""
he said. I'm planning on going in with him first thing in the morning. Hope
there's something fun out there. :)

I had another ""what the HELL am I doing with my life!?"" moment this
evening while I was sitting at dinner between two conversations. I have no idea
how I'm going to figure it out. Part of me just wants to settle down with a
""normal"" job. There's tremendous security in that, and as a bonus
I would be able to develop my local friendships in a way that would alleviate
some of the frustration I've been feeling lately. Argh.

BAHAMAS SHARK TRIP, FEB 27: MOUNT MOKARRAN

22:41 - The Coast Guard just stopped our boat to see if we were smuggling drugs.
As they came close enough to see us, one of the shouted, ""Is that Mr. Abernethy?""
It helps to be known. :)

Today was a fantastic day of hanging out with sharks. Jimmy never woke me up
in the morning; instead, I was shaken into consciousness by an increased swell
that repeatedly threw the bow of the boat up and down. I spent most of the morning
hanging out in the galley, waiting for an interesting shark to appear. By 11am,
we had two hammerheads and a tiger on the bottom, investigating two crates of
fish that had fallen off of the bait line. Unfortunately (for the rest of us),
only Derek was in the water at that time, but one of the hammerheads turned
out to be a player and circled around us until the sun went down. It was around
10' long. A smaller tiger shark was also in the water with us for much of the
day, but it was extremely skittish and was chased away by the hammerhead whenever
it came close to us. I saw it a few times off in the distance, but it never
ventured close enough for me to get a photo. Several large bull sharks were
at the bottom, along with a couple of nice looking lemon sharks (which carry
a permanent, sinister smile on their faces). By the end of the day, they were
getting close enough to us for photographs. It is apparently a great thing to
get bull shark photos with relatively clear water. I've heard that they can
be nasty, but haven't had any experience with them before this trip. At Walker's
Cay, it is easy to get close to bull sharks, but the visibility there isn't
as good unless you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to go in without
hordes of other people.

Simon seems to attract hammerheads when he returns to the boat from the water.
A few times now Anna has wrangled in hammerheads literally to the swim step
while Simon was trying to get onto it. When it happened today, he looked up
from the water and yelled, ""Stop your damn wrangling, woman!"" :)

The good barrister Derek wrangled for awhile today. I imagined him wearing
a wig. He has 11 weeks of vacation a year, and he takes every day of it. Europeans
REALLY know how to balance work and play properly!

Everyone almost literally jumped out of the water back onto the boat when five
or six bull sharks came charging up from 80' to greet them at the surface. Not
long after Jimmy dumped in an old, useless crate of fish, one of them came straight
at me as well. I took a picture and kept my camera between me and it. :)

Another interesting event: a hammerhead stole one of our 69-cent styrofoam
floats; it bit straight through the rope (eating the bait), and the float ball
drifted off the stern in the current. At Anna's urging, Jimmy promptly donned
fins & mask and dove in to retrieve it. The same gang of bulls who had earlier
expressed interest in the others on the surface immediately charged up again
to investigate. After all, the light-colored things in the water previously
were fish carcasses. :) Jimmy thrashed around in circles, coming up a few times
to yell, ""Shit!"" Jeremy happened to be coming back to the boat at
that time (we promptly sent him back out to help), but a few moments later,
Jimmy stuck his head up out of the water and yelled, ""I need a camera!"".
Typical. :) Jeremy told us that he was thinking, ""who's the idiot snorkeling
with the bull sharks?"" At Walker's Cay there is a strict rule that you
must be totally encased in black to get in with the bulls. Erich Ritter was
bare-legged when he was bitten there.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Noida grows, but poor infrastructure, closure of industries haunt

Noida, April 17 (IANS) Despite being a virtual extension of India’s national capital, this industrial hub, software centre and leisure destination still laments over poor power supply and roads, making the hunger for such essentials as well as the closure of industries major election planks. Close to 10,000 industrial units dot this city, technically in Uttar Pradesh but bordering New Delhi. Just a fourth of them function. Rising crime and poor infrastructure have only fanned the angst of the 250,000-strong electorate.

“The government in power has only traded stones and erected statues,” said Samajwadi Party contestant Narendra Bhati, seeking to blame both the central and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) government of Chief Minister Mayawati for the lack of development.

“Little has been done to look after the development of the state as a whole and this city in general,” Bhati told IANS, promising to bring change if elected.

For Noida Entrepreneurs Association president Rakesh Katyal, jobs, or the lack of them, was a major issue, as only 2,700 industrial units were functioning out of 9,700 that had set up shop here.

“The financial slowdown has eaten up small and medium industries and the rest are hit by high value-added tax. But the government does not appear to be concerned.”

Then there is mafia - and crime.

“The city is transforming from an industrial hub to a crime hub,” Aditya Ghildyal, general secretary of the Association of Greater Noida Industries, told IANS.

It was here that the infamous serial killings of children took place and gory tales of cannibalism hit global headlines. And it was again here that the chief executive of a multinational firm was lynched in broad daylight.

“Industrialists and we residents are scared to step out of our houses in the night. Why talk about night, there are incidents taking place in broad daylight,” said Ghildyal.

The suburban city which was earlier part of a reserved constituency, Khurja, has become Gautam Buddh Nagar constituency after delimitation. Home to nearly 400,000 people, this booming city has seen for almost four decades migration of people from all parts of the country, both for job and for a home of their own.

Noida has become a major residential hub as people took up apartments in the suburb’s high rises, strewn across the city, at most competitive prices, little knowing that they would have to later regret their decision.

Little wonder then that Satya Verma, an employee of information technology major Hindustan Computers Ltd, who was once elated getting a job in Noida, now regrets his decision.

“Development is restricted to some areas. Water is dirty. Electricity supply is poor. There are potholes everywhere. Theft and burglaries are routine,” he said.

“It is hard to believe that there are so many software companies here - many of them catering to Fortune 500 companies,” he added, a view shared by Sunit Rai, a public relations executive who lives in Sector 62.

“Why blame politicians alone? It seems people are also comfortable with big shopping malls mushrooming in the city. They do not really seem to care about basic needs like infrastructure,” Rai said.

The suburban city boasts of international-style shopping malls highlighting the glaring differences in the two parallel ecosystems that runs in the city. The Great India Noida Place - a one kilometre long mall - and other shopping marts like Centre Stage Mall, Spice and many more are some of the examples of its glamorous side.

Then there is the Atta market, a shoppers paradise for the middle-class, which houses almost everything a household would need at very competitive prices.

The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Ashok Kumar Pradhan won the 2004 polls from Khurja with an impressive margin of 41,350 votes. He is contesting this time from Bulandshahr and Mahesh Sharma, owner of the well-known Kailash Hospitals and a doctor himself, is the BJP candidate from Noida.

“We want maximum number of people to come out and vote no matter whoever they vote for,” BJP vice-president Chiranjeev Mahajan said.

“What this city needs is an educated leader who would understand policies and not any someone who would only grow richer with the nation’s money.”

The Congress got only 18.16 percent of the votes in 2004. This time, it has fielded Ramesh Chand Tomar, who was in the BJP for years and switched to the Congress recently.

The BSP too has a new candidate this year - Surendra Nagar, who has huge resources at his disposal being the owner of Paras Milk, a Rs. 600-crore dairy business.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Crowd besieges Danish Tehran embassy

A crowd of over 1,000 people tonight attempted to storm the Danish embassy in Tehran, which sits behind a high wall in the north of the city.

After they rammed the metal gate to the compound, police drove them back with teargas and arrested some.

Firefighters were seen trying to put out a fire inside, apparently caused by a firebomb.

Earlier, hundreds of demonstrators pelted the Austrian embassy compound with petrol bombs and rocks late, as protests over cartoons portraying the Prophet Mohammed spread across the Muslim world.

Denmark had previously asked the Iranian authorities to increase security at the embassy, following weekend attacks on its embassy in Damascus and its consulate in Beirut, which were both burned by angry demonstrators.

Iran's commerce minister announced today, however, that all trade with Denmark had been suspended.

Anger at the cartoons rose across east Africa: at least one person was killed in a protest in Somalia and Djibouti banned the import of Danish products.

In Kenya, the country's main Islamic group announced plans for a mass protest against Denmark.

Qatar's Chamber of Commerce said it had halted dealings with Danish and Norwegian delegations, urging Muslim states to do the same. In Bahrain, parliament formed a committee to contact Arab and Islamic governments to enforce the boycott.

In Strasbourg, the Council of Europe described as 'unacceptable' the violence of the past few days.

Freedom of opinion and expression is protected by European human rights law, 'even in cases when the views expressed were offensive,' said Secretary General Terry Davis.

Denmark told its nationals to avoid Muslim countries even as it pursued diplomatic efforts to defuse tension over the publication of the cartoons.

The foreign ministry warning lists 14 Muslim countries travellers should avoid following violent protests against the cartoons, which first appeared in a Danish daily.

Earlier today, there were demonstrations and riots across muslim Asia against the cartoons

Authorities in Afghanistan say three people have been killed during clashes between police and protestors.

Two were killed in gunfire from among protestors at the main gates of Bagram Airbase, 60km north of the capital Kabul. A crowd of about 5,000 people had gathered to protest outside the US-led coalition's Bagram headquarters.

Five protestors and eight police officers were wounded in the incident.

And in the eastern province of Lakhman, a third protestor died after being shot during a demonstration.

In Somalia, a 14-year-old boy was shot dead and several others were injured after crowds attacked police.

There have also been demonstrations in Indonesia, India, Gaza, Thailand and New Zealand.

The cartoons were first published in a Danish newspaper in September and have since been reprinted in several publications, most of them European.

UK police have govt support

The British government has said the behaviour of some Muslim demonstrators outside the Danish Embassy in London in recent days was completely unacceptable.

A Downing Street statement added that the police would have the government's full support in any actions they wished to take as a result of the protests.

Police have been criticised for failing to arrest some of the London demonstrators, as they carried signs threatening to kill those who published the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.

Earlier, some of Lebanon's political leaders accused Syria of being behind the attack on the Danish embassy in Beirut yesterday.

The mission was ransacked and burnt during the violent protests. The attack on the embassy has resulted in the resignation of Lebanon's Interior Minister, Hassan Sabeh.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Tentative Graduation Dates Set

I hope that everyone in your household is staying safe and finding continued enjoyment in your time together. As the school district alters or finalizes plans during this time of school closure, there are several items of importance that I want to bring to your attention.

New Feeding Sites to Open Monday, April 20

Beginning Monday, April 20, we will begin Grab-and-Go meal service for any child ages 1 to 18 at five additional school sites.

Angie Debo Elementary (16060 N. May Ave.)

Frontier Elementary (4901 Explorer Dr.)

Heritage Elementary (400 E. Sorghum Mill Rd.)

Northern Hills Elementary (901 E. Wayne St.)

Orvis Risner Elementary (2801 S. Rankin St.)

The meals will be available in the schools’ drive-thru from 12:30 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. Monday-Friday. Meal service will be set up near the schools’ cafeterias, which, in some cases, could be at the back of the building. The addition of these sites brings to 13 the number of feeding locations across our district. Each week, EPS is serving around 5,000 students an estimated 10,000 meals. For a master list of all Grab-and-Go feeding sites, go to edmondschools.net.

Tentative Dates Set for Graduation Ceremonies

District and high school administrators, as well as senior sponsors, have been finalizing plans to move high school graduation ceremonies to the summertime. The Cox Convention Center has been booked for two tentative dates, July 11 and July 24, the latter date preferred, but will be dependent on other concurrently scheduled events at the Cox. Additionally, we are requesting a booking date over fall break (TBD) that, while not ideal, still provides an opportunity to recognize and reflect upon our graduates’ accomplishments, even as they have begun their new lives in college or careers. We are communicating these dates now so that families have the opportunity to “hold” the dates and begin to make tentative plans with family and friends. National and local health and safety guidelines will dictate on which date the ceremonies will be held.

Commemorative graduation programs will be printed and school sites will soon announce tryouts among the valedictorians for the positions of graduation speakers. In the meantime, the district, thanks to a grant from the Edmond Public Schools Foundation, is purchasing yard signs for all graduates to proudly display at home to commemorate this important accomplishment. Members of the EPS Foundation Board and the schools’ teachers are planning a surprise posting of the yard signs in the seniors’ front yards. As we near the end of school, seniors will be contacted to solicit information regarding transcript needs, scholarships, and post-graduation plans. Also, dates will soon be announced for seniors to schedule appointments to return their Chromebooks and student IDs and at the same time pick up their official diplomas, yearbooks, and any personal items still remaining in the buildings.

District Developing Plan to Pick Up Personal Belongings

We hope to be able to announce by late next week our plan for how elementary, middle school and high school students (except seniors) will pick up their personal belongings and drop off school equipment such as textbooks, library books and so on. Thank you for your patience as we develop this process.

2020-2021 Annual Update to Open May 1

All Ages Ladies Soccer

Thistle ladies caused one of the upsets of the season defeating old rivals Workies 3-0. Knowing they had only 4 games to go, out of finals contention and only fielding 10 players, Thistle ladies had something to prove.
The first goal was a result from a brilliant cross by Maddie Risby to Brooke McDonald to slide one past the keeper. Rhiannon Walding scored next as she lofted a well weighted ball from near half way. Jamie-Lee Hunt closed off the scoring with a wonderful one on one with the keeper.
Ashlee Fitzpatrick, Jennifer Merry and Annmarie Tomazin were once again outstanding in defence. Angie Cambourn and Jacinta Moon held their own in the middle of the field shutting down any attack coming down the centre. Danielle Byrne was outstanding in goals saving some tricky and fast shots determined to not to let any slip past her.
Overall Thistle ladies have had a fun and wonderful season and we hope to see you all back next year!",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Rapper Iggy Azalea says she is now concentrating on executive producing film and TV projects. The 26-year-old star has revealed that she is no more interested in acting but she will remain involved in the industry through her production company, Azalea Street Productions, reported Femalefirst.

“There’s no more acting but I actually am doing a lot of executive producing. I’ve got a film coming out next year that I’m producing. “I’m not going to say what network, but I’ve just signed a first rights deal agreement with a big network in America that I am executive producing. We are doing five shows a year for the network, all scripted,” she said.

Azalea, however, remained tight-lipped over projects her production company is working on. “I’m not acting but I’m definitely creating a lot of scripted content that you guys will be seeing. I find books and projects and things that I like and I team up with writers and go over the scripts and develop them. “I have a production company called Azalea Street Productions. It is all secret still,” she said.

Australian rap superstar Iggy Azalea is the latest recruit to join the X Factor Australia judging panel, which returns to our screen this week just days after it premieres in Australia.

We find out what the Fancy singer plans to bring to this year’s series.

What type of artists are you hoping to unearth?

I’m not necessarily looking for that ballad voice although it would be nice. I think I just really want someone with an interesting story who is an interesting person. Charismatic, warm and friendly. Somebody that I would want to be friends with and everybody is drawn to. I want to really take the time to notice who is memorable and then also who’s talented and can pull it off on stage. But I think sometimes these shows become so much about who can belt it out the most and not enough about personality. I really want to find that person who can still be in people’s minds even when the cameras aren’t rolling anymore.

Have you seen any rappers?

No, I’m not looking for a rapper. I never really feel like that works in this format. Rap is about song writing and this is about singing and covering other people’s songs, so I don’t know that this works in this format because you’re singing someone else’s lyrics and you also don’t necessarily have a vocal ability, so what are you showcasing if they’re not your lyrics? It kind of gets into murky water, lost in translation.

The ‘Black Widow’ hitmaker – who was born in Sydney and grew up in Mullumbimby – sees America as her home now but enjoys returning to her birth country from time to time.

She said: ‘I mean, to be honest with you, my home is in America. I’ve lived there for a decade, that’s where I live. It’s great to come back and visit my grandparents, but there is no home connection. It would be like you going home to where you lived when you were nine, I kind of don’t associate with that anymore.’

And the 26-year-old singer is ‘proud’ of the success she has achieved.

She added to Australia’s Herald Sun newspaper: ‘To be the best, you want to compete with the best. The people I saw back then who I saw in the charts, who were at the top of our charts, were American.

‘I am proud, but I think anybody would be proud of the success that I’ve had, whether they come from a big city or a small town. It’s tough, no matter what.’

Meanwhile, Iggy will return to Australia following the announcement she will be a new judge on The X Factor.

She said previously: ‘I hope it will be a bit of a summer getaway and I can work too. It will be summer so hopefully I can get out and chill and show everybody that is coming with me the good food and the beach and play some tennis and ride horses.

‘Spending a month in Australia is the longest I will have spent there in literally like 10 years.

Aussie rapstress Iggy Azalea appears to be turning her attention to producing content for NBCUniversal. The “Team” performer just signed a production deal with the company to create original content.

Azalea made the announcement via Instagram with a photo of her signature on the contract.

“Wanted to share with everyone that my production company ‘Azalea Street’ has just signed on to create original content for Universal NBC! So guys, I’m an Executive Producer for at least a few years to come! Hopefully many! Lots of scripted series in the works! Lots of interesting ideas!”

This partnership between Azalea’s company and NBCUniversal appears to have been in the works for some time. She mentioned her interest in producing content during a recent interview with Notion magazine.

“I would still like to get into producing movies and television series, behind the scenes and will be doing that in the next one or two years.”

So, if you’re waiting on Azalea’s sophomore album, you’re going to need to keep waiting. But that doesn’t mean she isn’t hard at work!

Rapper Iggy Azalea has bought a new home and is busy decorating it following her recent split from her ex-fiance Nick Young.
The “Fancy” hitmaker, 26, seems she’s keen to wipe clear any memories she has of her former lover by setting up home elsewhere and putting her own stamp on the interiors, reported Conmtactmusic.

Taking to her Twitter account, she said, “Can’t wait to get home and get started on fixing up my new place. I’ve been annoying Adam and Guy talking about carpet all week (sic).”

The 26-year-old rapper moved out of the home she shared with Nick in Tarzana, California, late last month after she saw the NBA basketball player getting frisky beneath the sheets with a mystery woman on their home CCTV.
Azalea and Young began dating at the beginning of 2014 and got engaged in 2015, but their romance was rocked earlier this year when the “Team” hitmaker had to suffer the indignity of a video leaking online which showed Nick admitting to his Los Angeles Lakers teammate D’Angelo Russell that he had cheated on her with a teenager.

Iggy Azalea is gearing up to join a new “team.” The 26-year-old has confirmed she’s taking her talents down under to join the judges’ panel on The X Factor Australia.

“I understand what it’s like to have giant dreams and intend to help other young Australians achieve theirs by sharing my knowledge and developing their talent in collaboration with The X Factor,” the Sydney-born artist said in a statement.

Iggy will replace Dannii Minogue (sister of Kylie) on the talent show’s upcoming eighth season, though her fellow co-judges have yet to be announced.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Retailers had worse sales in November than expected — because of Sandy. The economy isn’t doing as well as experts thought it would — because of Sandy. New home sales were weaker than first reported — because of Sandy.

Hurricane Sandy, of course, was a mighty disaster. But it is a godsend to anyone who needs an excuse. Didn’t do your term paper? Blame Sandy. Missed a credit-card payment? It’s Sandy’s fault.

Hell, I’m going to plead emotional distress — because of Sandy — the next time I get a traffic ticket, forget to hold open a door or jaywalk.

So you can now expect any company, especially those selling or doing anything on the East Coast, to blame the infamous hurricane. This will go on for months. Sandy is like spackle: it covers a whole lot of mistakes.

If you want to entertain yourself for a few seconds, put the words “because of Sandy” into a Google search, and you’ll see that everything from blood drives to restaurants to pay phones to college application deadlines were affected by the storm.

I mention this because the Labor Department will announce its employment numbers this Friday. They aren’t supposed to be very good — only 90,000 new jobs compared with the 171,000 jobs that magically appeared just a few days before the presidential election.

As I’ve mentioned before, the last two employment reports were unusually — and suspiciously — strong. A person with a skeptical mind might think this was because the Democrats needed good economic reports to hold power.

President Obama will be in office for another four years, and there is now no real reason to prove statistically that the economy is stronger than it really is. In fact, with the current fiscal-cliff talks, it might be better for the administration to show economic weakness so that the Republicans are forced to negotiate.

Besides, if Friday’s number is less than the 90,000 expected, or the unemployment rate goes higher than the anticipated 8 percent (from 7.9 percent), Sandy will be blamed.

I have a prediction: a lot of newborns in 2013 will be named — you guessed it — Sandy because of Sandy.

In my last column, I wrote about pedophiles posting their filth on Facebook.

But this isn’t just Facebook’s problem.

Companies that advertise on the site are going to be humiliated someday when their ads run alongside sexually explicit images of children. And this is a format problem that only a complete overhaul of Facebook’s design will solve.

As it now stands, the advertisements that come up on a Facebook user’s screen are meant entirely for that user. What I mean is, if a person’s Facebook profile says he has a family, the ads will reflect that with, for instance, lots of insurance and financial-services companies.

It doesn’t matter what the Facebook user is looking at on the left part of his screen. Those ads come up automatically on the right side.

So when The Post’s computer technician and I were investigating the disturbing photos the other day, we saw a stack of ads for MasterCard, Dunkin’ Donuts, State Farm Insurance, the state of Arizona, a game called “Battle Pirates” and Kim Crawford Wine on the same screen.

I wonder what those companies would think if they knew.

*

Wall Street may care about Friday’s jobs report, but the thing that really matters on Main Street is income statistics.

Here are some:

According to the Federal Reserve, real median household income was up just 1.2 percent in October from this year’s low of $50,757 in April. The current $51,089 income level is slightly above what it was at the end of last year.

Median income was $54,761 in October 2007.

So, you see the problem?

Well, you really don’t get the whole sense from those numbers. Besides this drop-off in income, households are also getting hurt on their investments.

Sure, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index is up nicely this year, and the Dow Jones industrial index has some gain. But people aren’t likely to cash in stocks — and have to record a gain or loss on taxes — when they want to make a purchase.

They are more likely, in my experience, to look at their bank accounts, see interest income and spend the money that their money has made. But interest income is so puny these days because rates are being held at historic lows by the Fed.

Bottom line: Households are not only earning less at work but also getting less return on their savings. Add to that the possibility of higher taxes at the end of the year, and you can probably can see why the economy is in a perpetual state of blah.

The only states in which consumers should be feeling any better are those where marijuana has been legalized.

My favorite joke of the week is Obama asking for an end to the US debt ceiling. With the Fed already having created $3 trillion in an alternate currency to buy its quantitative-easing bonds, the idea of also giving Washington a blank check on spending is pretty hilarious.

I wonder how hard our kids will be laughing 10 or 20 years from now when they endure the 1920s German experience of having to cart wheelbarrows full of currency to the supermarket.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Camy here: If you haven't read anything by Robin Lee Hatcher yet, you need to go out right now and buy this book! I have to admit that I enjoy her historical novels more than her contemporaries. (I hope that doesn't make her upset. :) You can read excerpts of all her books on her website in case you don't believe me when I tell you she's a fabulous writer!

Robin Lee Hatcher discovered her vocation as a novelist after many years of reading everything she could put her hands on, including the backs of cereal boxes and ketchup bottles. The winner of the Christy Award for Excellence in Christian Fiction (Whispers from Yesterday), the RITA Award for Best Inspirational Romance (Patterns of Love and The Shepherd's Voice), two RT Career Achievement Awards (Americana Romance and Inspirational Fiction), and the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, Robin is the author of over 50 novels, including Catching Katie, named one of the Best Books of 2004 by the Library Journal.

Robin enjoys being with her family, spending time in the beautiful Idaho outdoors, reading books that make her cry, and watching romantic movies. She is passionate about the theater, and several nights every summer, she can be found at the outdoor amphitheater of the Idaho Shakespeare Festival, enjoying Shakespeare under the stars. She makes her home outside of Boise, sharing it with Poppet the high-maintenance Papillon

ABOUT THE BOOK

It's 1918, and Daphne McKinley, heiress to a small fortune, has found contentment in the town of Bethlehem Springs, Idaho. But Daphne has a secret.

A series of dime novels loosely based on local lore and featuring a nefarious villain known as Rawhide Rick has enjoyed modest popularity among readers. Nobody in Bethlehem Springs knows the man behind the stories ... except Daphne.

When newspaperman Joshua Crawford comes to town searching for the man who sullied the good name of his grandfather, Daphne finds herself at a crossroads, reassessing the power of her words, re-thinking how best to honor her gifts, and reconsidering what she wants out of life.

Propelled by a white hot fury, Joshua Crawford pushed open the door to Gregory Halifax’s office so hard it hit the wall with a loud wham. Startled, Gregory looked up a split second before Joshua slapped the newspaper onto the desk.

“What is this garbage?” Joshua demanded.

Gregory’s expression changed from one of surprise to a smirk. “So you read it.”

“Of course I read it, and I’m here to demand a retraction.”

“A retraction? For what?”

“For what you wrote about my grandfather.”

Gregory laughed softly. “You must be joking. The article is about dime novelists. The part about Richard Terrell was the words of the author, not mine.”

“But you made what Mr. Morgan wrote in his novels sound as if it was fact rather than fiction. It’s not.”

“How do you know it’s not? Tell me. What do you know about your grandfather before he settled in St. Louis? Nothing, that’s what. You’ve said so yourself.”

“Did you contact anyone in Idaho to try to confirm that the character in Morgan’s books is based on the real Richard Terrell?”

“I didn’t need to. I interviewed the publishers for my story. And again, the focus of my article is the men who write dime novels, not on the characters found in their books.”

“But in the process you’ve dragged my grandfather’s good name through the mud. I want a retraction.”

Gregory pushed back his chair and stood, the smile gone from his face. “When you prove anything I wrote is in error, then come see me again, and we’ll have this discussion. Until then, get out.”

For one moment, Joshua thought he might be able to control his temper. For one very brief moment — just before he caught Gregory’s jaw with a right hook followed by a left jab to the gut. Gregory flew backward into the wall. The glass in the office door rattled again. Joshua readied himself for the other man to fight back. To his dissatisfaction, it didn’t happen. Gregory’s eyes were still unfocused when more men poured into the office and grabbed Joshua by the arms, hauling him away. One of the men was Joshua’s boss, Langston Lee.

“You’re fired, Crawford. Collect your things and get out. I won’t have my reporters brawling. You hear me. Get out or I’ll call the police.”

Joshua longed to turn his rage onto his boss, to give Langston Lee a little of what he’d already given Gregory Halifax. But he had enough good sense left to resist the urge. He was already out of a job. He didn’t want to spend time in a jail cell besides.

But so help him, he would get a retraction out of this newspaper. He would prove Gregory Halifax was a shoddy reporter and see that he was fired. He would hear Langston Lee apologize. And he would make certain D. B. Morgan never again maligned his grandfather in print.

This wasn’t over yet.

Chapter 1

October 1918

Maybe it was time to kill Rawhide Rick. He’d served his purpose, the old rascal. He’d hunted buffalo and fought Indians and stolen gold from hardworking miners and sent men to the gallows. Now might be the time for him to meet his Maker. The trick was deciding how to kill him.

Daphne McKinley rose from her desk and walked into the parlor, where she pushed aside the curtains at the window.

A golden haze blanketed Bethlehem Springs. It had been a beautiful autumn. The prettiest one yet in her three years in this serene Idaho mountain town. The trees had been the brightest of golds, the most fiery of reds, the deepest of greens. Daphne had spent many a mild afternoon walking trails through the forest, enjoying the colors and the smells.

If Rawhide Rick — who by this point in the series of books had become the infamous Judge Richard Terrell — was dead, what would become of the dashing Bill McFarland, hero of The McFarland Chronicles? Without his arch enemy, his life might become rather dull. Or perhaps it was Daphne who would find life dull without Rawhide Rick. Wicked he was, but he certainly kept things interesting whenever he was around.

She rubbed her eyelids with the tips of her fingers, and when she pulled them away, she noticed ink stains on her right hand. Her fountain pen was leaking. Perhaps it was time to buy a typewriter. But would writing on a machine feel the same?

Daphne turned from the window, her gaze sweeping the parlor. She’d come to love this small house on Wallula Street. Since moving into it soon after Gwen — its previous owner — married Daphne’s brother, she’d delighted in making it her home, decorating and furnishing it in ways that pleased her. Daphne’s childhood homes had been large and filled with servants waiting to attend to her slightest wish. But she had often been forced to live by the timetables of others. Now she could do as she willed, when she willed. The freedom she enjoyed was intoxicating.

The best part was when she wanted to be with family, she got into her motorcar — her very own, quite wonderful McLaughlin- Buick — and drove to her brother’s home to play with her young nephew and infant niece. She was completely dotty over the two of them. She loved to crawl around on the floor with Andy — he would turn two at the end of November — the both of them squealing and giggling. And there was nothing like cuddling three-month-old Ellie. Daphne thought the baby girl smelled like sunshine.

A sigh escaped her. She hadn’t time for daydreaming about Morgan’s and Gwen’s darling children. She must decide what to do. If she was going to kill the judge, she needed to notify Elwood Shriver at once. Wavering in indecisiveness served no good purpose.

She returned to her small office. The floor around her desk was littered with wadded sheets of paper. It was always thus when words frustrated her. “So wasteful,” she scolded softly.

of the war half a world away was splashed across the front page. More than a million American men — just boys, many of them — were now fighting in Europe alongside the Allied Powers. The end was near, some said. She prayed to God they were right. Too many had died already. Others, like Woody Statham, would wear the scars from their war wounds for the remainder of their lives — if not on their bodies then in their souls.

She flipped through several more pages of the newspaper, but nothing she read captured her imagination or sparked her creativity. Besides, she’d read every article before, some of them several times.

Maybe her problem wasn’t with Rawhide Rick. Maybe the problem was Bill McFarland. Maybe she was tired of him. Maybe he should die.

“Maybe the whole lot of them should perish,” she muttered as she laid the newspaper aside.

She spun her chair toward the bookcase beneath the office window. There, on the bottom row, were copies of The McFarland Chronicles by D. B. Morgan, all ten volumes. And if she didn’t decide soon what to do about Rawhide Rick, ten volumes would be all there were.

There was no question that Daphne loved writing stories of adventure and danger in the West of forty and fifty years ago. And while she would concede that her books were not great literature, they were entertaining, for readers and for herself. But there were days like today when she was tempted to contact her editor in New York City and tell him that she (D. B. McKinley, whom Elwood Shriver thought to be a man) was retiring and thus so must D. B. Morgan (the pseudonym used on her books). However, she knew she would miss the storytelling were she to give it up. After all, it didn’t take much effort to clean her small house or cook the As she sat down, she took up the five-day-old newspaper. News occasional meal. Without her writing pursuits, what would she do with her time?

It would be nice if she could discuss her feelings with someone, but there wasn’t another person, in Bethlehem Springs or elsewhere, who knew she was the author of dime novels. She wasn’t sure her brother would believe her if she told him. The only soul who might suspect anything was Dedrik Finster, the Bethlehem Springs postmaster, because of the mail she sent and received, but his English wasn’t the best and he probably had no idea that Shriver & Sons was a publishing company. Why would he?

Maybe what she needed more than anything was a drive out to the Arlington ranch and a long visit with Griff Arlington, Gwen and Cleo’s father. That man had given her more story ideas in the last three years than she could ever hope to put on paper. It was Griff who had told her about the escapades of the real-life Richard Terrell, every bit as much a scoundrel as her fictional character, although perhaps in different ways. Yes, a visit with Griff was just what the doctor ordered.

Her mind made up, she rose and went in search of hat, gloves, and coat.

****

Joshua stepped from the passenger car onto the platform and looked about him. A large family — father, mother, and six children — were being escorted into the railroad station by a young man in a blue uniform. They were on their way to a hot springs resort located north of Bethlehem Springs. He knew this because they had spoken of little else during the journey, and Joshua couldn’t have helped but overhear their conversation as they’d been a rather boisterous group.

He, on the other hand, was headed into the town that appeared to be about a quarter mile or so up a dirt road that passed between two low-slung hills. Switching his valise to the opposite hand, he set off in that direction.

The first building he saw upon entering Bethlehem Springs was a church. All Saints Presbyterian, according to the sign out front. Catty-corner from All Saints was the Daily Herald, his destination. He crossed the street and entered the newspaper office. Familiar smells — newsprint, ink, dust — filled his nostrils.

An attractive but pale-looking woman, dressed in black, came out of the back room, hesitated when she saw him, then moved forward, stopping on the opposite side of a raised counter. “May I help you, sir?”

“Yes.” He set down his valise and removed his hat. “My name is Joshua Crawford. I’m here to see Nathan Patterson.”

“I’m sorry, Mr. Crawford.” Her voice broke, and it took her a moment to continue. “Mr. Patterson passed away.” She drew a long breath and released it. “I’m his widow. Perhaps I can assist you.”

Either Nathan Patterson had been much older than his wife or he had died tragically young, for Joshua guessed the woman to be no more than in her early thirties.

Joshua had counted on this job. Without it, he couldn’t afford to stay in Idaho. He would barely have enough money for train fare back to St. Louis, as long as he didn’t spend a night in the hotel, and even then he wouldn’t have much left over to buy food. He would be extremely hungry before he reached Missouri. Not to mention that he wouldn’t have a job waiting for him when he got there — unless he was successful here first.

“I’m glad you’ve come, Mr. Crawford. My husband would be heartbroken to see this newspaper fail. I assume you can do more than report?”

“Ma’am?”

“You are qualified to manage the paper, I trust.”

Manage it? That was more than he’d expected. But if it worked out . . . “Yes, I am qualified,” he answered — with more confidence than he felt.

“Good. Nathan’s final instruction was for me to offer you the job as managing editor of the Daily Herald. If you’re interested, that is.”

He hadn’t thought to be in Idaho more than a month or two. Surely he could discover the information he needed, take care of matters, and return to Missouri before Christmas. On the other hand, success as a managing editor would look good on his résumé, would give him many more opportunities than simply working as a reporter for a small paper.

“Are you interested, Mr. Crawford?”

He had few other options. None, actually. Not if he wanted to honor his grandfather’s memory. Not if he wanted to restore his own good name and get back his old job. Taking the job as managing editor didn’t mean he would be here forever. He could keep the newspaper running until Mrs. Patterson found his replacement. It was the least he could do for the man who had paid his train fare from Missouri to Idaho. “Yes, Mrs. Patterson. I’m interested.”

“The pay will be ninety-five dollars a month to start. I know it isn’t the sort of salary you must have received at a large newspaper, but you’ll have a place to live for free.” She pointed at the ceiling. “There’s an apartment above the office with a kitchen and bath. It hasn’t been used for several years, but with a bit of elbow grease, it should clean up well and prove adequate for a bachelor such as yourself.”

Ninety-five a month. Not quite twelve hundred a year. Less than Langston Lee had paid him back in St. Louis, but more than the sum Nathan Patterson had offered when he’d applied for the job with the Daily Herald. With a place to live thrown in, the salary would allow him to put money aside for when he returned to Missouri.

“That sounds fine,” he answered.

Mrs. Patterson gave him a fleeting smile. “Good. Now let me show you to your quarters. I’m sure you must be weary from your journey. We can begin work in the morning.”

****

Daphne was invited by Griff Arlington to have supper with the family and to spend the night at the ranch as she occasionally did, but she declined. Griff ’s storytelling about his early days in Idaho had done just what she’d hoped. Ideas were rolling around in her head, and she was desperate to get them on paper before they disappeared like a puff of smoke in the wind.

As soon as she walked into her house, she tossed her coat over the nearest chair, dropped her hat on the table, and hurried into her office, where she lit the lamp and began scribbling as fast as she could. It seemed she barely drew a breath for the next hour. When she looked up at last, she saw that night had fallen over Bethlehem Springs. Her stomach growled, reminding her that she’d missed supper. Still, she had little desire to cook. This seemed like a good evening to pay a visit to one of the town’s restaurants.

Daphne had three choices — the Gold Mountain, which served the most wonderful breakfasts; the restaurant inside the Washington Hotel where she liked to dine before an evening at the Opera House; and the South Fork, famous for their pies and home-style fare. She decided on the latter.

As she walked briskly along Wallula Street toward Main, her way was lit by street lamps, one of many improvements made during Mayor Gwen McKinley’s term of office, which had ended almost ten months earlier. Daphne thought it unfortunate for the town that her sister-in-law had retired from public service. She hoped that, when her nephew and niece were older, Gwen would run for office again.

As Daphne neared the office of the Daily Herald, she noticed light spilling through the windows of the apartment above it, something she’d never seen before. Was the newly widowed Christina Patterson up there, perhaps sorting through memorabilia from her marriage? Should Daphne postpone her evening meal another hour and see if she could offer the woman any comfort or assistance?

Nathan Patterson’s death had been a shock to the town. A man of thirty-seven years, he’d looked in the pink of health. To have him weaken and die so suddenly had taken everyone, especially his wife, by surprise. And even while they grieved the loss of a friend, many wondered about the future of the Daily Herald. It had been almost a week since the last edition. What would become of the newspaper without Nathan at its helm?

A shadow fell across the nearest window, and Daphne stopped on the sidewalk, still pondering what she should do. Would Christina welcome a visit from her or had she gone up there to escape intrusion? Daphne remembered all too well how difficult the death of a loved one could be. She’d been a girl of sixteen when her beloved father died, a young woman of twenty when she’d lost her mother. Even now, all these years later, she felt a painful sting in her chest, knowing she wouldn’t see either of them again this side of heaven.

She also remembered that sometimes she’d wanted to be alone with her memories, alone to cry and mourn. And so she decided not to disturb the new widow and instead moved on, rounding the corner onto Main Street and entering the South Fork Restaurant a few moments later.

Delicious scents filled the dining room, making her stomach grumble once again. It was late enough that the dinner crowd had come and gone. There were customers at only two tables — Mabel and Roscoe Finch, who worked for her brother and sister-in-law, and Ashley Thurber, the elementary school teacher. Daphne greeted each one of them before sitting at a table in the corner, her back to the wall. Whenever she dined out, she preferred similar seating. It allowed her to study others without being too obvious. She loved to watch and listen to people. She’d learned a great deal from the habit, and much of what she’d learned had made it into her stories at one time or another.

Sara Henley — a shy, plain girl of eighteen — approached Daphne, a pad in her hand and a smile on her face. “Evening, Miss McKinley.”

“Wonderful.” Sara lowered her voice. “My dad’s agreed I can study art. I won’t leave for school until spring, and I have to save every cent I earn to help cover my expenses. But all winter I can look forward to going.”

Daphne touched the back of Sara’s hand with her fingertips. “I’m glad for you. You have a wonderful talent. You must promise that you’ll write and tell me all about the school and its instructors once you’re there.”

“’Course I will. If it wasn’t for your encouragement, I never would’ve had the nerve to ask my dad to let me go.”

Daphne had done little besides tell Sara that she shouldn’t give up on her dreams, no matter how long it took, that God could open doors in surprising ways if she would simply trust Him. But she was glad Sara had found her words to be helpful and even more glad that Sara’s father had consented. “I believe art school will be the making of you. Wait and see if I’m not right.”

As Sara disappeared into the restaurant kitchen, the front door opened, letting in the cool night air along with a man Daphne had never seen before. He was tall, at least six feet, perhaps a little more. He had brown hair that was shaggy near his collar, and unless the poor light in the restaurant deceived her, there was the shadow of a beard under the skin of his jaw and upper lip.

Who was he? Not a cowboy nor a miner. That was clear by the clothes he wore. His suit appeared of good quality, but even from where she sat she could tell it had seen its share of wear. A man of trade perhaps or a salesman. Definitely not a guest of her brother’s spa, for he looked neither wealthy nor in poor health.

At that moment, the stranger turned his head and his gaze met hers. She swallowed a gasp of surprise. Good heavens! He had the most astonishing eyes. What color were they? She wished she could tell. So pale. Perhaps blue. Or maybe a silvery-gray. No, they were blue. She was sure of it. And she seemed unable to look away, even when she knew she should. Thankfully, he broke the connection and moved to a table, sitting in a chair with his right side toward her.

Daphne drew a hungry breath into her lungs. Until that moment she hadn’t known she’d held it.

Could I capture his eyes with words? What a character he would make. He could be Bill’s friend. Perhaps he could ride with him for the next few adventures. What name should I give him?

She pulled a small notebook and the stub of a pencil from her pocket and made a few notes to herself.

In Daphne’s fourth, fifth, and sixth novels, her hero, Bill McFarland, had courted a woman in Idaho City, but she’d grown tired of waiting for him to propose and had married someone else. Perhaps this new friend with his magnetic eyes could help Bill find the right woman, one who wouldn’t object to his adventurous spirit. Then again, Bill would have to watch out or his new friend might steal the right woman for himself.

The thought caused her to glance up from her notebook — only to discover he was looking in her direction. Her breath caught for a second time and a blush warmed her face as she dropped her gaze again. Oh, yes. Mr. Blue Eyes would definitely make things interesting for the readers of The McFarland Chronicles. She hoped her dinner would arrive soon. Another late-night writing session was looming.

December 5, 1871

There comes a time in a man’s life when it seems prudent that he look hard at his past, to remember from whence he came, to learn to be grateful for God’s mercy, perhaps even for the purpose of becoming a cautionary tale for others. And so I have decided to write an account of my life, from beginning to the present, knowing all the while that the future will be significantly different from those years that have gone before. In truth, I already know that my life will soon change for the better. I know this because, at the age of fifty, I am about to take a wife. No former associate of mine could be more surprised at this news than I am. I never believed I was the marrying kind. Nor would I have believed a woman as fine as my Annie would agree to be my wife, especially after she learned of my less than pristine past.

But I am getting ahead of myself. A record of my life should begin at the beginning. And so it shall.

****

I was born on a small farm in Missouri in the winter of 1821, the youngest of five children, all boys. My parents came to the region after the War of 1812, along with many other settlers. Like most everyone they knew, my parents were poor. They eked out a living the only way they knew how, through hard work and sweat and tears. They weren’t educated, and they yearned for something quite different for their children.

It amazes me, as I look back, that my mother managed to teach her sons so much when she never attended school a day in her life. Not that I appreciated her efforts back then. All I wanted when I was a lad was to go fishing or hunting or even just to lie on my back on a hot summer day and watch the clouds drift by. Still, despite my lack of enthusiasm, I learned to read and write and do arithmetic. I even came to appreciate, albeit many years later, the wisdom and enjoyment that could be found in books.

My parents were god-fearing people, but since there was no church within easy distance of our farm, it fell to my father and mother to see that their sons came to know the Bible and to embrace the tenants of the Christian faith. In this regard, I was even less enthusiastic. Rebellion resided in my stubborn heart, and it did not matter if my father took a strap to me or my mother sweetly entreated me. I would not yield.

Perhaps, given enough time, I might have come to know the God my parents believed in. But there wasn’t enough time. They died of the fever when I was eight years old, along with two of my brothers. Moses was ten and Oliver was nine. That was in the winter of 1829. February, I believe. There was deep snow on the ground and the temperatures were frigid. My surviving two brothers could manage no more than shallow graves as the ground was frozen hard.

I have never confessed this to a living soul, but I cried myself to sleep at night more often than not in the months that followed.

My two oldest brothers, Jefferson and Lyman, took over running the farm and raising me. They did the best they were able, them being just boys themselves, Jefferson not yet eighteen, Lyman only sixteen. I wish now that I had appreciated them more.

After I stopped crying myself to sleep at night, anger took the place of tears. I was angry with everyone, and my temper got me into plenty of trouble. I was fourteen the year I hit Lyman so hard I broke his nose. Of course, he gave me back in kind. A few weeks later, I struck out on my own.

I never knew what happened to my brothers. By the time I got to an age and a place where I wanted to get in touch with them, where I would have liked to see them again, they were gone. I was told they sold the farm and nobody knew where they went from there.

I have often wondered if they are still alive. I wonder if they think of me and wonder the same.

Fatou Diome

Meet the writer

Born in Senegal in 1968, Fatou Diome has lived in France since 1994. A politically engaged author, her literary work is nourished by her struggle against intolerance. Her most recent work, Marianne porte plainte! is an excellent example of this. In it she demonstrates how the concept of national identity fractures society, creating a barrier between ‘them’ and ‘us’, while ignoring the migratory flows that have always played an important role in history. It celebrates the emancipating virtues of education, enabling us to go beyond our strictly defined perceived affiliations, to combat amalgams and to focus on the collective destiny of the human species.
Fatou Diome sees Humanity as something more than the sum of its artificially labelled subgroups.
The encounter with the author is the start of Les Assises Citoyennes sur les Migrations organised by the CNCD 11.11.11 and is organised in the context of the Migrations campaign by 11.11.11.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Pakistan 'militant leader' Malik Ishaq arrested

Pakistani police have detained Malik Ishaq, founder and former head of militant group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), at his home in Punjab province.

The group said that it carried out an attack in a Shia Muslim area of the southern city of Quetta last Saturday which killed almost 90 people.

However, it is not clear whether Mr Ishaq's detention is directly related to the attack.

Mr Ishaq spent a decade in jail before being released in 2011.

A heavy contingent of police surrounded Mr Ishaq's residence and held negotiations with him, after which he gave himself over to the police, the BBC's M Ilyas Khan reports from Islamabad.

He had been released from jail a few months ago, our correspondent adds.

It is not clear whether Mr Ishaq has been formally charged with any offence. Under public order laws, suspects can be held in Pakistan for three months without any charge.

Pakistani authorities have long been criticised for not taking enough action against groups such as LeJ that foment sectarian violence.

When a local journalist asked Mr Ishaq in 2011 what intended to do after his release from jail, he replied his organisation would continue its ""good work"" - fighting those who opposed their version of Islam.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The American Society for Microbiology (ASM) is pleased to submit the following testimony on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 appropriation for the Department of Energy (DOE) science and research programs. The ASM is the largest single life science organization in the world with more than 37,000 members. The ASM mission is to enhance the science of microbiology, to gain a better understanding of life processes, and to promote the application of this knowledge for improved health and environmental well-being.

The DOE Office of Science is the lead federal agency supporting research and development (R&D) in energy, a field rich with innovation possibilities and economic significance. The Office of Science manages a portfolio through six program offices: Advanced Scientific Computing Research, Basic Energy Sciences, Biological and Environmental Research, Fusion Energy Sciences, High Energy Physics, and Nuclear Physics. The Office of Science directly finances both DOE and non-DOE R&D projects, while operating unique federal facilities also made available to extramural scientists and engineers.

The ASM is concerned that budget cut backs will negatively impact Office of Science programs that clearly contribute to US global competitiveness in science and technology. Although the specific effects of sequestration mandated cuts are still uncertain, the DOE anticipates a $215 million decrease for the Office of Science in FY 2013.

Both academia and industry in the United States depend upon funding and facilities available through the Office of Science. For decades, it has been the dominant federal sponsor of physical sciences research, while also supporting advances in computer science, materials science, mathematics, biological and environmental science, nanotechnology, and engineering. DOE grants and contracts support researchers and their students at more than 300 US colleges and universities. Funding cuts will impact all scientific users of DOE facilities in addition to the probable reductions in both the size and number of extramural grants awarded. DOE has also predicted that sequestration would cause schedule delays and increased costs for planned new user facilities. Collectively, these declining resources negatively impact the training of the Nation’s future R&D workforce.

DOE Funding Expands R&D Enterprise and Supports InnovationIn FY 2013 the DOE’s Office of Science was slated for increased funding to support physical sciences and engineering, guided by strategies to enhance US capabilities under the America COMPETES Act and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act. The final Office of Science funding level still fell far short of the doubling pace of increases established by the America COMPETES Act. Federal R&D expenditures are far sighted investments in innovation and ultimately in US economic vitality. Although the United States today, remains the world’s single largest R&D performer, the Nation’s R&D growth has slowed and decreased in recent years, especially when compared to growth in other nations. Under the current DOE Strategic Plan, the agency’s priority goals include: “maintaining a vibrant US effort in science and engineering as a cornerstone of our economic prosperity, with clear leadership in strategic areas.”

Last November, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) released its report on the future of the US research enterprise. Among its conclusions was that the US is “unique in the world in the range and quality of its Federal and National Laboratories” and that “the three pillars of the US research enterprise are its research universities, its National Laboratories, and industry's substantial commitment to basic and applied research.” The DOE’s national laboratories are integral to R&D innovation and economic success. The Office of Science manages 10 of the 17 DOE laboratories in this country, utilized each year by more than 25,000 non-DOE scientists nationwide.

In 2012, updates to the DOE’s strategic plan specifically addressed the importance of Office of Science managed facilities: “prioritization of scientific facilities to ensure optimal benefit from Federal investments….By September 30, 2013, formulate a 10-year prioritization of scientific facilities across the Office of Science based on (1) the ability of the facility to contribute to world-leading science, (2) the readiness of the facility for construction, and (3) an estimated construction and operations cost of the facility.” Many Office of Science facilities host one of a kind, unique and difficult to access equipment; often too expensive to construct and operate elsewhere. The DOE points to the example of the pharmaceutical industry’s use of Argonne National Laboratory’s Advanced Photon Source to rapidly screen the molecular structure of candidates for novel drug design. The computing facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory recently screened 2 million different drug compounds against a targeted receptor in less than two days, using 3D biological simulations at a fraction of the cost and time typically required.

DOE sponsored discoveries have evolved into valuable commercial products and processes through the agency’s emphasis on technology transfer (T2) to the private sector. In 2012, DOE researchers won 36 of the 100 awards announced each year by R&D Magazine for the most outstanding technology advances with commercial potential. Since competition began in 1962, DOE national labs have won more than 800 awards. T2 mechanisms like patent licensing and cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) have built strong collaborations among the Office of Science, other federal entities, and US industry. Annual T2 performance metrics underscore DOE’s importance to the US research enterprise: in FY 2010, 697 active CRADAs; 1,616 new inventions disclosed and 480 patents issued; 6,224 licenses granted for using DOE inventions or other intellectual property; and about $41 million in licensing income and $25 million in royalties.

In 2012, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory licensed its microbial detection array technology to a company that supplies DNA microarrays and instruments, for eventual commercialization and sale to food safety professionals, law enforcement, medical professionals and others. The Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array (LLMDA) technology can detect within 24 hours, more than 2,200 viruses and 900 bacteria currently among its probe array, which will be updated periodically. In February, DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) announced 17 of its projects have attracted more than $450 million in private sector funding after ARPA-E’s initial investment of approximately $70 million. Twelve have been leveraged to form new companies, and at least 10 have partnered with other government agencies for additional investment. ARPA-E was created under the America COMPETES Act, receiving its initial funding in 2009. The ARPA-E projects with current private sector investments include engineering bacteria for efficient fuel production and developing electrofuels; or liquid fuel derived from renewable electricity and bacteria.

DOE Funding Promotes Biological Sciences and Sustainable EnergyWithin the Office of Science, the Biological and Environmental Research program funds cutting edge studies in environmental contaminants, biofuels, genomics and cross disciplinary research integrating biological and physical sciences. The ASM is particularly interested in BER’s broad utilization of microorganisms, including redesigning microbes for sustainable fuel production and optimal contaminant bioremediation. We recognize the invaluable contributions from BER’s Genomic Sciences Program and the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI), ambitious efforts of notable benefit to understanding the biological sciences that clearly justify strong funding in FY 2014 and beyond. Previous investments have generated a long list of results, including these recent examples:

University scientists used X-ray crystallography to discover the structure of the regulator inside tuberculosis bacteria that control the pathogen’s efflux pump rendering the pathogens resistant to drugs.

DOE scientists determined the genetic sequence of a group of microbes called SR1 bacteria that have not been cultivated in the laboratory, discovering that the bacteria employ a unique genetic code; human oral SR1 bacteria are elevated in the oral infection periodontitis.

Scientists studying bacterial RNA-guided cleavage of foreign DNA have described a new approach to editing microbial genomes, a type of “programmable DNA scissors” that has promising R&D applications through new biofuels and therapeutic drugs.

Scientists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory demonstrated for the first time that a cyanobacterium can produce hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously and steadily for at least 100 hours, potentially important to commercial hydrogen production.

DOE chemists will use high-throughput technologies developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory to screen beef samples for shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), during a three-year project focusing on the early detection of STEC at all levels of the US beef production chain.

DOE programs like BER and ARPA-E are leading the nation’s R&D on renewable energy sources. In 2012, DOE joined with the Department of Agriculture (USDA) in distributing $41 million among thirteen new biomass R&D projects aimed toward sustainable biofuel production, in addition to other funding for biomass genomics to improve biofuel feedstocks. The joint sponsorship is part of a much larger DOE initiative with USDA to increase US biofuels. JGI researchers recently sequenced the genomes of eleven strains of a group of bacteria called actinobacteria, which produce cellulose degrading enzymes of interest to the biotechnology and biofuels industries and identified eight cellulolytic species not previously known to degrade cellulose biomass. DOE scientists also described a unique molecular transporter mechanism to deliver molecules into algal cells, pointing the way to engineering algae that synthesize biofuels, vaccines, and other compounds. At DOE’s Joint BioEnergy Institute, researchers identified a tropical rainforest microbe that can survive high concentrations of ionic liquid used to dissolve cellulosic biomass in biofuel production, while others developed a new synthetic biology technique, dynamic sensor regulator system, which detects metabolic change and controls gene expression in microbes during biofuel production, increasing output.

The ASM urges Congress to fund the Department of Energy’s Office of Science at the highest possible level in FY 2014. The DOE Office of Science programs enhance United States competitiveness through fundamental research and advanced scientific breakthroughs that revolutionize the Nation’s approach to challenging and ongoing, energy and environment challenges.

The ASM appreciates the opportunity to provide written testimony and would be pleased to assist the Subcommittee as it considers the FY 2014 appropriation for the DOE.

Lukaku doubled the advantage shortly after the restart, rising to meet Daley Blind's cross and heading home with power.

"Vinchopolis

In which our heroes meet in a tavern

It was just another day in Vinchopolis. With a newly-conquered island kingdom under its thumb, the city’s supply of wood was suddenly quite well stocked. There were also rumours of a new race called “Eladrin” who carried with them a terrible plague. Although these creatures had officially been confined in quarantine, word had gotten out that some had escaped, and vigilantes had taken to killing them on sight as a public health measure.

Penrhyn Firewing arrived for work at her miserable job in the Department of Fine Print Penmanship and Small Parcel Deliveries, where her gnoll boss yelled at her for being late despite the fact that she was on time. She went to her little cubicle and worked away filling out forms until she ran out of ink. She went to the supply room to replenish her ink, but there was none in the closet. In its place was a note instead saying “See boss about ink”. So she went to see her boss again (he was passed out from exhaustion) and got yelled at again (after she woke him). Eventually she figured out who she was supposed to see, and in exchange for the ink, she was required to deliver a few things, including a message to a certain police precinct.

Meanwhile, Markto left his basement for the first time to wander the streets in search of his father. He saw the semanet urchins above, and watched as one keeled over and died, splatting in the street. Another urchin took its place almost immediately. Markto followed the flag messages, hoping they might lead to his father.

Meanwhile, in a grimy bar in the anarchist district, Idril tried to gauge public attitudes toward the city, the system, and the rumoured existence of a Cult of the City and its purported messiah figure. Vicaun and Spire (in its female Tiefling disguise) were hanging out there and noticed Idril. They tried to run their usual 3-card monte scam, but she didn’t bite. Just as she was about to leave in search of the Cult, Spire called out to her.

Spire questioned Idril about her intentions, then offered to set up a meeting with a cultist in one hour. Idril agreed. Then Spire and Vicaun went off to the side to discuss things privately.

Vicaun didn’t think well of the Cult, and seemed unimpressed with his partner’s arrangement. But as soon as they were alone, Spire shapeshifted into Vicaun and started talking excitedly about this big score they could pull on Idril. Vicaun got all uncomfortable and asked Spire to shapeshift into something else. Spire responded by shapeshifting into Vicaun’s mother.

Spire reasoned that if Idril knew the locations of other islands that could be exploited for resources, the information could be extraordinarily valuable. It suggested a plan to earn Idril’s confidence and get her to reveal it.

Meanwhile, Sub-Patrolman Tomok Biter, the Orc watchman (who speaks with an Irish brogue) was sent on patrol as part of a new program with a really long, bureaucratic name, involving “cultural outreach” or somesuch. The program was primarily about pacifying and eliminating individuals who stuck out too much. His new partner was a stinky Troglodyte, Chegar, who enjoyed smashing things. Chegar was very pleased with himself, as he had made a xylophone out of the bones of a bunch of goblins he had killed the other night. Tomok sighed and humoured him, taking care to stay downwind.

Their patrol turned up very little, so they headed back to the station.

Meanwhile, the smog made it difficult for Penrhyn to fly, so she had to land. Lurching down the street toward her was a bizarre, complex, Rube-Golderg-ian robot. It had no standard parts, no serial number, no identification of any kind. This disturbed Penrhyn deeply, and she flew up to perch on its head.

It asked Penrhyn if she had seen its father. Penrhyn questioned the automaton about its serial number, origins and so forth, but it seemed unable to answer. So she decided they should file a missing persons report in an attempt to find the automaton’s “father”. Since Penrhyn had to deliver her message to the police department anyway, it would not require her to go far out of their way. In addition, she could stay perched on the automaton’s head and get a ride.

When they arrived at the station, message turned out to be for SubPatrolman Tomok Biter. The automaton (whose name turned out to be “Markto”) asked Tomok if Tomok has seen father. Penrhyn apologized for the strange machine and attempted to explain that it must be broken or something. Penrhyn and Tomok tried to ascertain Markto’s origins, but it was simply too strange to figure out.

Then Tomok’s partner excitedly announced they got a hot tip about the Eladrin quarantine escapee. Tomok decided to leave and deal with the missing persons report later (that would have had to travel to the department of Missing Persons Forms). Markto followed Tomok out into the streets, and Penrhyn rode along on Markto’s head, still searching for a registration plate somewhere on its body.

Meanwhile, as Vicaun and Spire prepared their Cult disguises, they got word from other cultists of trouble back at the dive bar. Apparently the Eladrin had been causing quite a stir, talking about how life doesn’t have to be like this, about how they have entire forests full of growing plants where she comes from. The treacherous duo rushed back to make sure their gravy train wouldn’t be derailed.

And so it was that our heroes converged right around the time a local unofficial official public health vigilante organization jumped out screaming “Kill the filthy plague bearer!” The bar patrons screamed, and the fight began.Chegar just wanted to smash things, the goblins (vigilantes) just want to kill Idril, the duo wanted to keep Idril alive, Markto wanted to find his father and was convinced that Tomok could help, Penrhyn was disturbed at the continuing inappropriateness of Markto not having the correct paperwork, and Tomok… Tomok was getting a headache.

Idril took a serious beatdown from the vigilantes. The duo burst in and fought back. Tomok decided to arrest the vigilantes and restore the peace. The vigilantes resisted arrest. Chegar just wanted to smash something, so he smashed Markto.

Spire briefly switched to true form, admiring Markto’s beauty, then screamed in horror when Markto was struck. Spire then switched back to its cultist form (an intense Elf with male pattern baldness) and psychically assaulted the troglodyte. Only Penrhyn noticed this odd shift from a high window as she scorched the goblins with her magic. Under the combined assault, the vigilantes fell quickly, and as the last goblin standing surrendered, Idril teleported outside the building and fled. Moments later, Vicaun knocked Chegar unconscious.

The battle was over, and our heroes had won, but the chaos would be difficult for Tomok to explain in his report, Spire was apparently unhappy with Idril’s hasty exit, Idril would need to go into hiding, Markto was damaged and no closer to finding his father, Penrhyn was still perturbed at the lack of proper paperwork, and Vicaun feared the loss of yet another potential big score to bad luck.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Cigarette sales dive, hurting health funds

Search form

WARNING: Arizonans quitting smoking may be hazardous to the fiscal health of publicly funded programs that receive tobacco tax revenues.

Tucson Citizen

Friday, November 30, 2007

Heidi Rowley

Sales of cigarettes in Arizona have fallen by millions of packs since voters approved a big tobacco tax increase and a ban on smoking in bars a year ago

Tobacco tax revenue increased $57 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30, to $345.6 million.

But all of that increase, and more, went into a new fund for early childhood education. The fund received $74 million, nearly all the revenue from an 82-cent per pack increase approved by voters.

It means that other state funds and programs that get tobacco tax revenue, including the state's program to help people stop smoking and other health-care funds, have gotten less money.

And the end of the decline is not yet in sight, said Kevin McCarthy, president of the Arizona Tax Research Association.

""They are in the early stages of seeing diminishing returns,"" McCarthy said. ""Their pots of money are only going to decrease over time.""

McCarthy's group warned last year that the higher tobacco tax would present the state with a fiscal hazard.

In the last seven months of the 2006-07 fiscal year, cigarette sales fell so much that state funds dependent on tobacco tax revenues took in about $17 million less than they did in 2005-06.

The program for the poor is known as the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. It used money from the state general fund to make up for declining tobacco tax dollars this time out.

But the state's dark economic outlook and expected budget tightening could limit or eliminate that option in the future.

""It will be a much more discussed issue next spring as the state tries to deal with its overall picture,"" AHCCCS Deputy Director Tom Betlach said.

Even programs that help smokers quit are seeing their funding source shrink as the demand for their services increases.

The state tax increase on a pack of cigarettes, from $1.18 to $2, took effect last Dec. 1, after voters approval in November.

Eighty cents of the increase go to the Early Childhood and Development Fund, created by Proposition 203, known as First Things First for Arizona's Children.

Two cents go to Smoke Free Arizona, an education program in the state Department of Health Services focusing on the smoking ban in public buildings. That ban took effect effect May 1.

Sales of cigarettes in Arizona dropped 50 million packs, or 31 percent, in the first eight months of 2007, to 112 million packs compared to 161.6 million during the same period in 2006.

AHCCCS took almost $10 million from the general fund in 2006-07 because of the drop in tobacco tax money, spokeswoman Rainey Day Holloway said.

Although revenue from tobacco taxes is less than 1 percent of the agency's $7.5 billion budget, AHCCCS' Betlach said the agency monitors it regularly.

From July through October, the first four months of fiscal 2008, Betlach said, AHCCCS received $8.7 million less in tobacco tax revenue than in the same period last year. He said the Legislature will have to reassign funds to make up the difference.

AHCCCS has not had to cut any programs.

AHCCCS gets tobacco tax revenue through both the Tobacco Tax and Health Care Fund and the Tobacco Products Tax Fund.

The Tobacco Tax and Health Care Fund was created in 1994 when Arizonans voted to increase the cigarette tax by 40 cents a pack, from 18 to 58 cents, to pay for health care for the medically needy through AHCCCS, among other programs.

The Tobacco Products Tax Fund was created in 2002 when voters approved increasing the tobacco tax to $1.18 a pack to help fund AHCCCS and the state's trauma centers.

Together, the funds have shrunk more than $14 million with cigarettes sales down.

In addition to AHCCCS, the Tobacco Tax and Health Care Fund supports the Tobacco Education and Prevention Program, run by the Arizona Department of Health Services.

The Tobacco Education and Prevention Program funds local smoking cessation programs and the Arizona Smokers' Helpline.

Since Dec. 1 - when the new tax kicked in - the number of calls to the line has more than doubled, to 425 a week from 175, said Stephen Michael, director of the program.

Staff monitoring the line helps quitters by making weekly and sometimes daily phone calls of support. It also refers callers to local programs, such as Pima County's Tobacco Free Ways. The program has added 6 1/2 full-time positions since Dec. 1 to make and take calls.

""Demand for our program is going up,"" Michael said. ""We've had to increase employees. . . . If more people are going to quit, you are going to have to put money into it.""

Referrals from physicians to the line have increased to 750 a month from an average of 150 before the tax increase. A total of 2,700 referrals has come in since July, compared to 550 from July to November 2006.

About 40 percent of the people using line to quit are on the prescription drug Chantix, Michael said. The state pays for 50 percent, or about $60, of a 30-day supply. The state also will help pay for nicotine patches.

Byron Homer, administrative services officer for the Tobacco Education and Prevention Program, said the state is trying to lower the smoking rate from 20 percent of adults to 12 percent.

""It's frustrating,"" said Marcy M. Flanagan, senior program director of Pima County's Tobacco Education and Prevention Program. ""If we're going to get the rate down, we're going to have to fund these programs.""

As more people quit, the ones left are hard-core smokers who need costlier help.

""It might take more medical intervention to get people to quit,"" Flanagan said.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

And more on Warlord Games Bolt Action as sanctimonious gits

Apologies to regular viewers - this is a bit of a rant.As part of my Bolt Action purchases I got a British machine gun and crew. I couldn't quite see from online pictures how it all went together.

Luckily in the box there was card which said go to their webpage for instructions.

However when I tried to go there I got the message.

""This is somewhat embarrassing isn't it. .... Either it as been moved or you typed a wrong address."" And I thought is this a message for me as if I've made a mistake, or about them not having the advertised page available. But if it was them, then I'd expect an apology for it not being available and a redirect. Then I thought, what a bunch of arrogant smug sanctimonious gits. You provide a guide to a page then insult people who follow that guide. At the moment I'm not sure whether to buy anything else for Bolt Action, or from Warlord Games. Maybe I'm just being too reactionary, but stuff them; I'm a customer and I expect an advertised service. Bah humbug!

Personally I have only bought their product second hand, so usually built and undercoated. Poor show that the link doesn't work, they need to have a look at battlefront, may be overpriced and out of scale but the website does help in the build.

Had a very different experience with Warlord Games. Purchased at a show a SS boxed set which was missing a medic figure. Contacted the seller and not interested in resolving the problem. Contacted Warlord and happy to help. Too the point that they sent me a full box set with medic figure and all the other 20 figures too.

That said I do think that they need to remove the wording about you getting the wrong address. Most people who use the net now understand the need for the correct data in the address or you don't get what you want.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Davis, Boone miss first day of mini-camp

SANTA CLARA (AP) — The start of the San Francisco 49ers’ three-day mandatory minicamp was overshadowed more by the players who were absent than the ones in attendance.

Two-time Pro Bowl tight end Vernon Davis and right guard Alex Boone skipped the first day of San Francisco’s minicamp Tuesday. Both starters are seeking raises despite two years left on their contracts.

Coach Jim Harbaugh also said cornerback Eric Wright was not with the team because he’s contemplating retirement. Wright, a seven-year veteran who played in seven games for the 49ers last season, had participated in most of the team’s offseason conditioning program.

Players can be fined nearly $70,000 if they miss all three days of the minicamp, per the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement. If Davis and Boone continue to hold out, they set the stage for what could be major distractions leading into training camp next month for a 49ers team that has Super Bowl aspirations.

Harbaugh said he appreciates players who show up for the voluntary workouts in the offseason but expects everybody in attendance for the mandatory meetings. He said he was “disappointed” Davis and Boone are holding out.

“Not the decision that I envisioned being the 49er way,” Harbaugh said. “Really nothing more to be said about it. The focus will be on what’s going on here.”

Neither Davis nor Boone has been present during the first eight weeks of the team’s voluntary offseason program. Davis sacrificed a $200,000 bonus for missing the workouts.

And while both are seeking new deals, Davis has been the most vocal about his situation.

“In 2010 I signed a five-year, $37 million contract extension with $23 million guaranteed. It was the biggest contract for a tight end in league history. Four years later, and I’m playing at a higher level than I was then, which brings me to why I’m holding out,” Davis wrote in a guest column for MMQB.com on Monday. “It’s all about getting paid what you deserve. It’s not that complicated. I want the 49ers to win the Super Bowl, and I want to be on the field this summer working toward that goal, but I have to worry about my future first.

“Most of my teammates and many players in the NFL understand that. A few don’t,” Davis continued. “Behind closed doors, they’ll say they’re all about the team and would run through a brick wall for the organization. But when you look closer, they’re doing things to contradict themselves. I can’t listen to anyone but my family and my advisors, because those are the people who are going to be there when football inevitably dumps me.”

Davis, who initially acted coy about skipping the team’s voluntary offseason program, began making his displeasure known publicly shortly before the 49ers announced they had given quarterback Colin Kaepernick a six-year contract extension through the 2020 season that could be worth up to $126 million.

Davis, who is now 30 years old, had 52 catches for 850 yards and accounted for 13 of Kaepernick’s 21 touchdown passes last season.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Queen Victoria’s private beach to open

English Heritage has returned to the beach the original wooden bathing machine which ran down a ramp into the sea and from which Victoria – her modesty preserved – would emerge in her swimming suit. English Heritage has also restored the small covered seat – The Queen’s Alcove – where she sat and sketched the coastal views.

""Queen Victoria is fixed in many people’s minds as ‘the Grandmother of Europe’, a Queen who spent most of her reign in mourning for her husband,"" said Simon Thurley, English Heritage’s Chief Executive. ""Opening her beach at Osborne lets us show another side to her – this was a Queen who collected sea shells with her children, who sketched the changing sea, and who swam sometimes twice a day. Osborne was her seaside retreat from the formalities of Buckingham Palace, now people can visit that seaside.""

""It is impossible to imagine a prettier spot,"" Queen Victoria wrote after a visit to Osborne and Prince Albert likened the bay to that of Naples in Italy. The beach was a deciding factor behind their decision in 1845, to buy the seaside property as their private home. Osborne Bay was often used as a landing for both the royal family and visiting dignitaries while the royal children collected shells from the shore and learned to swim in the special floating bath (since destroyed) designed by their father, Prince Albert.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Independence from Obamacare needed

Legislative update

Tonight in Prime Time

BC News Friends to follow

By U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston
Special to the News

POSTED:July 11, 2013 6:00 p.m.

The Obama administration last week announced it would postpone a controversial mandate within Obamacare for one year. Without the delay, businesses with at least 50 employees would be subject to fines beginning next year if they failed to provide their employees with health insurance.The announcement conveniently came just before a long holiday weekend for many Americans and while the president was abroad. It also just happens to push the job-killing requirement past next year’s elections.The good news, though, is that employers are given a year of relief from this massive new regulatory requirement.The bad news is everything else.Already, businesses have spent millions preparing to comply with the new regulations. Hard-working Americans have seen their hours cut so as not to be classified as full-time employees under the law.The move does nothing to impact the individual mandate that will require all Americans to purchase health care or be subject to a penalty. Already expected to cost $4 billion, the delay could further drive up President Obama’s historic deficits, as more are forced onto government-subsidized insurance plans.Try as it might, the Obama administration cannot issue enough waivers, special-interest carve-outs or delays to hide the fact that Obamacare is the wrong prescription for America. It increases costs, takes away choices and does nothing to solve the underlying problems in America’s health-care system.Instead, the law’s 159 new agencies, bureaus and boards will churn out new regulations, requirements and mandates. Already, they have added some 20,000 new pages of government rules, adding to the regulatory burdens that hold back our economy.Instead of delaying aspects of Obamacare, the misguided law should be repealed in its entirety. We should replace it with common-sense legislation that will bring down costs and increase access to care without growing the size or scope of the federal government. Enacting medical-liability reform, expanding health-savings accounts and opening interstate competition for insurance plans would do a world more good to that end than Obamacare ever will.This disastrous law was ramrodded through Congress with such reckless abandon that Nancy Pelosi said, “We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it.” Now that President Obama and his allies are learning just what is, they should join us in giving the American people independence from Obamacare.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Gary B. Sanders, “Confederate Conflict in Jackson County, Alabama”

Guest columnist Gary B. Sanders, who is kin to the Sanders family of Montgomery and Randolph Counties of North Carolina, has ancestors on both sides of the U.S./Confederate divide. Here, Gary tells the story of his great, great, grand uncle, Joseph Sanders of Jackson County, Alabama, who was murdered during the Civil War on account of his Unionist views.

Confederate-Unionist Conflict in Jackson County, Alabama: The Murder of “Uncle Joe” Sanders, 1863

By Gary B. Sanders

Jackson County, Alabama, lies in the northeast Alabama hill country, near the Tennessee border, a region of yeoman farmers who were only reluctantly persuaded to join the Confederacy in 1861. As the war progressed and the fortunes of the Confederacy waned, there was a breakdown in social control in such counties, often leading to guerrilla warfare, revenge killings, and general lawlessness. The story of the murder of the elderly Joseph Sanders on April 10, 1863 on his own farm in Jackson County was one such incident, briefly mentioned in newspapers of the time but long remembered by Joseph’s descendants as they passed down the family tradition of their ancestor who died a martyr to his loyalty to the Union. As always with such stories, embellishments along the way and varying renditions of the event may not reflect what actually happened. A closer look at the life and death of Joseph Sanders, however, may help us understand the disrupting impact of the Civil War on life in Jackson County.

Scene from Jackson County, Alabama. Photo courtesy of Gary B. Sanders

Joseph Sanders was born in 1793, in Randolph County, North Carolina, the son of Joseph and Rebecca Sanders. The elder Joseph, a Revolutionary War patriot, died in 1803 and made provision in his will that if any of his children became orphaned before they came or age or were married that they should be apprenticed to Quakers. This provision of the will never took effect, as all the children were married within six years of their father’s death. Five of senior Joseph’s seven children married children or grandchildren of Isaac Saunders of Randolph County, who, according to DNA tests of his descendants, was not related to Joseph at all. This close relationship between these two unrelated Sanders lines has baffled genealogical researchers among their descendants, but it helped to cement family ties and loyalties whenever descendants of Isaac and Joseph moved from North Carolina.

The younger Joseph was the last of his siblings to marry when he wed Martha Sanders on August 21, 1809 in Randolph County. In the late 1820s, Joseph and Martha, their large family of children, and many of their relatives moved to Jackson County, Alabama. As the Cherokee and other Indian groups were pushed further west, the northeast Alabama region along the Tennessee River became a prime destination for white settlement. Joseph bought land in Jackson County in 1831 and farmed there the rest of his life. Many of his Sanders cousins also moved to Jackson County as did his brother George and his brothers-in-law Francis Sanders and Benjamin Sanders, along with their numerous families.

During the late 1830s, Martha died, and Joseph began seeking a new wife. He re-married about 1838 to Deborah Saunders who was another granddaughter of Isaac Saunders of Randolph County. One of the descendants of Joseph’s second marriage, Lottie Kingery Hoge, later wrote of Deborah,

I don’t know how she first got acquainted with my Alabama grandfather, Mr. Joseph Sanders, but she went to Alabama and they were married. He was much older than her for he had been married before and had 12 children, most of them grown and married, probably at ages of 14-16. I don’t know when they [Joseph and Deborah] were married but probably about 1838 for their oldest son was born about 1840. That was Uncle Henry.

Joseph and Deborah had three children together before she died about 1854. Joseph married for the third time on November 11, 1860 to a widow, Mahala Harper Shelton of Jackson County. The 1860 census list Joseph as age sixty seven with personal property worth $1500 and real estate worth $1500. While he was not a wealthy man, these assets were enough to indicate his farm was prosperous by the standards of the time. Joseph Sanders, by 1860, was the acknowledged patriarch of the Jackson County Sanders. Nearly everyone called him “Uncle Joe,” regardless of whether he was actually an uncle, cousin, granduncle, or some other relative. In fact, nearly every Sanders in the county was related to him, in some cases as double cousins.

When the Civil War began, the citizens of Jackson County were split far more evenly in loyalty than in most southern counties. There were few large slave owners in the county and many residents were subsistence farmers who had little regard for the institution of slavery. In 1850 only one man named Sanders in the county owned slaves. Nevertheless, there was still substantial support for the Confederacy, and those who refused to accept secession were regarded as traitors by those who supported the Rebel cause. Although too old to serve as a soldier, Joseph Sanders remained loyal to the national government and his sons and many of his nephews and grand nephews joined the Union Army.

The conflicting loyalties in northeast Alabama created a very chaotic and lawless situation in which it is often difficult to determine the motivations of the people involved. Confederate and Union armies moved back and forth across the county, as did bands of deserters, often with no loyalty to either side. Murders, shootings, and acts of violence were commonplace toward the end of the war. “Uncle Joe” Sanders was killed in one of these incidents in 1863 while at his farm at Mud Creek.

The following letter by Louie Richard Davis of Texas was written to friends in Scottsboro, Alabama, July 24, 1974, and was published in Sanders Siftings, July 2000, p. 1:

I know you have some information on the Sanders that was killed by bushwhackers. I have heard a story here in Texas passed down through generations (may have changed some). One of the Sanders, close relation to Phoebe was caught off guard while plowing in a field by bushwhackers. They took him and his horse to the top of a hill and made the Sanders dig a grave. Then the bushwhackers killed both man and horse and buried both in the grave with the legs of the horse sticking up out of the grave. This is some tale and may not be exactly true but is what I have heard. [This Phoebe was the daughter of Joseph’s sister Mary and her husband Benjamin Sanders. Louis Davis was a descendant of Phoebe.-gs]

Other accounts of the killing differ somewhat in the details. A second version was e-mailed to me in 2007 by Bob Dean, a descendant of Rebecca Sanders, Joseph’s niece:

Mud Creek is located north of Scottsboro, and there is a cave there, the one that we have always known as Blowing Cave. Joseph Sanders patented 80 acres of land in 1831 that contained this cave. I will tell you the story told [to] me as close as I can remember it. It is not exactly like the story that we have heard before but close.

Bob’s informant, John Dolberry, owned the Mud Creek property that belonged to Joseph Sanders and he remembered listening to his grandmother talk about the murder many times when he was a child. His grandmother was the daughter of John Sanders, a son of Mary Sanders, Joseph’s sister, and her husband Benjamin Sanders. In his conversation with Bob Dean, John Dolberry pointed to the cove behind the house and said they hanged Joseph

back in the cove at the foot of the mountain on a big mulberry tree. It had a big limb that ran out and then turned up. His grandmother said that was the limb that they hung Joseph on. He was hanged by southerners who thought he was giving help to the Yankees. There were three of the rebels, one a neighbor by the name of Barbee. After killing him they left with a horse they were using as a pack mule to carry, I suppose, the things that they had taken. After they killed Joseph, they left, leading their horse. That evening, not long after the rebels left, a group of Yankees came down out of the mountain and went after the rebels. They caught up with them near the foot of the mountain close to the old Moody Brick. The Yankees killed the horse and made the men dig a grave for it. When the grave was dug, they killed the men, put them in the hole and rolled the horse in on top of them. This could be the story of putting Joseph in the grave with the horse on top of him and the horse with its legs sticking up.

They [Joseph’s family] buried Uncle Joe and there were four cedar posts put at the corners of his grave. These were moved after somebody in Texas had the marker put in. [This grave marker was erected in the 1990s.-gs]. The mulberry tree was there for a long time; it had a limb that stuck out and turned up. That was the limb upon which they hanged Uncle Joe.

His [great] grandmother sat over there with the body until someone came to help get him to the house. So, apparently he was not killed where he was buried. But the fact that he was buried there would seem to indicate that he lived there.

Bob concludes, “It may be as close to eyewitness information as we can get even though his information did not come directly from someone that was there. It did come in a direct line from someone that was a witness to the events. I’m sure that the story is not without flaws, mistakes, and bad memory but may be as close to the truth as we’ll ever get.”

More detail about the identity of the men who killed Joseph Sanders is found in a January 27, 2004 posting on the Sanders Ancestry.com forum by Don E. Schaefer, editor of Sanders Siftings, and a descendant of Benjamin Sanders who married Joseph Sanders’ sister Mary:

Here is some information about the Joseph Sanders (1793-1863) often referred to as Joseph, Jr.: Concerning the murder of Joseph Sanders, this is what I have picked up from several sources. From notes in the Scottsboro library: “Joseph Sanders was taken from his home during the Civil War and was shot while on his knees by a rock because his boys were in the Union Army. Everyone called him Uncle Joe. He was shot by Jeff Barbee, Thomps Houston, and John Teeters on his farm near Mud Creek, these men were tories never served on either side during the Civil War.” Ann Barbee Chambless of Scottsboro told me that she has been searching for the real story of what happened. A brother of her great-grandfather was one of the “whippersnappers” and she can find no record of a trial. Her ancestor had a record of an estate settlement about that time. Possibly some vigilante justice or Union troops took care of things, without leaving a record. With the lack of a trial or record, I guess many versions of what happened cropped up, slanted to whatever a person’s sympathies were during and after the war. Glenn (Chick) Sanders of Huntsville says that there was no marker for Joe Sanders and he and some other relatives had one put up on his grave. He also said he has been told that two of Joseph Sanders’ sons, Henry A. and John G., killed two of the men who murdered their father.

Don Schaefer’s account is based partly on the testimony of Carroll Jackson Brewer in 1876 to the Southern Claims Commission concerning the compensation claim of John Sanders, Joseph’s nephew: “James Hawkins and others searched for his uncle often and did take out him, J. Sanders who was seventy years old, they taken him out of the field when he was at work and shot him on the side of the mountain.” Carroll Jackson Brewer was married to John Sanders’ half-niece and therefore related by marriage to Joseph.

Don Schaefer also contributed some material he received from Ann Barbee Chambless who was related to one of the men who killed Joseph:

I keep hoping you will unearth the real story about the murder of Uncle Joe Sanders, even though my great grandfather’s brother was one of the three culprits. One of the older men in this county has told me the “hanging tree” still stands at the head of Mud Creek where justice was administered. I still do not know if it would be labeled “roadside justice” or as you suggested Federal troop intervention. I do know that a group of Federal troops stationed in this area took over the Barbee home for their winter quarters one year. My great-great uncle was a very young boy at the time. He lived until I was about six or seven years old, so I remember hearing him repeat stories from that time period. Of course, he never told about his brother being hung. His stories were about his father’s death just before the Civil War (died in 1860) and how another brother died of measles after enlisting in the CSA. That brother was buried at Corinth, MS. My own great grandfather was a CSA Scout and was in the Federal prison at Rock Island. Uncle Lewis told what a difficult winter he, his mother, and his older sisters had the winter they were forced to live in what had been slave quarters. That is one reason I have always been so interested in learning more about the murder of Uncle Joe Sanders and what happened to the culprits. If your Madison County contact provides you with any part of the story, please be sure to share with me.” [From Ann Barbee Chambless, the Jackson County (Ala.) Historical Association].

Although John Dolberry’s family tradition was that Joseph was hanged, the only document contemporaneous with the murder, a brief newspaper article from the Huntsville Confederate for April 23, 1863, stated that Joseph was shot: “On the same day, we learn, an old man, named Saunders, who affiliated with the Abolition Army, when they occupied Jackson county, and went off with them, but returned to depredate on the neighborhood, was shot and killed by some unknown person, on Mud Creek in that county.”

Just as we do not know for certain whether Joseph Sanders was shot or hanged (or possibly both), we have no firm documentation on what happened to the men who killed Joseph Sanders. The family tradition from John Dolberry states that the killers were slain by federal troops shortly after the murder; another account mentioned by Don Schaefer is that “vigilante justice,” possibly by Joseph’s sons, took care of the killers. Whatever may have happened during the war as the aftermath to the incident, after the war the event lived on for the most part only in the tradition of the Sanders family and their relatives. There are no records of legal investigations and no suggestion of any enduring blood feuds. Probably, for whatever reason, the murderers did not live long after the killing.

The impact of the War, of course, endured for the rest of the lives of the participants. Joseph’s widow and her stepsons appear to have quarreled over his estate. In 1874, eleven years after his death, she was given as her dowry rights a one-quarter distribution from his estate.

Three of Joseph’s sons served in the Union Army and two of them were wounded at the Battle of Nashville. When Henry, one of the sons, returned home and discovered that his young wife was pregnant, he divorced her and had nothing to do with her or the baby. He married again and eventually had eight children. Joseph’s nephew, John Sanders, returned home after serving in an Ohio Regiment and later became a justice of the peace in Jackson County. In 1876 in testimony to the Southern Claims Commission, John’s friend and relative by marriage, Carroll J. Brewer, stated that John had been a firm Union supporter even before the War:

I knew him about twenty-five years for all that time and live about three miles from him at Mainard cove, PO, Jackson county. I have heard him discuss that he could not sustain the secession principles…all of his talk with me was in the side of the union and he always voted in support… Claimant went into the Regular Federal Army and served nearly three years, and he caused nineteen men with him when he went.

The loyalty of the Sanders family of Jackson County to the Union probably had more to do with the unique political climate of the county rather than with any philosophy unique to this family. Close relatives of Joseph and his nephew John who lived outside the county often joined the Confederate Army. John Sanders himself recognized the influence of geographical location in his testimony to the Southern Claims Commission:

I have a brother said to be in the Confederate army. I did not see him [join?] Isaac Sanders, forty-four or five years of age on entering the Confederate army in Montgomery County, Arkansas. I have no influence on him. He lived in Arkansas when he joined the army. [He or I?] contributed nothing to his outfit. [He] would not of have been living here.

This may mean, possibly, that in John’s opinion Isaac would not have joined the Confederates if he had still been living in Jackson County.

In John’s testimony and in that of his neighbors, we can ascertain his intense national loyalty. We see much the same intensity in the affidavits filed in support of pension claims of the other Sanders men who fought for the Union or in testimony to the Southern Claims Commission concerning their claims for compensation for property losses during the war. With Joseph Sanders, however, the record is silent on any voiced expressions or writings he may have made in support of the Union cause. All we have as a record is his actions in encouraging his sons and neighbors to support the Union, efforts that ultimately led to his death.

John Dolberry, the descendant who still lived on Joseph Sanders’ farm as of 2007, stated that Joseph was not buried near the mulberry tree where he was killed. Instead, he was buried some distance away near where an infant child of Joseph and Deborah had been buried earlier. There may very well be other family members who are buried nearby, but no other markers are present today.

Originally four cedar posts were erected to mark Joseph’s grave. Later, in the early 1990s, someone erected a modern tombstone marker. Unfortunately, the dates on the new tombstone are incorrect and the name is given as Joseph B. Sanders, although there are no records that give him a middle name or initial. His real birth and death dates are 1793 and March 10, 1863, according to census records and the testimony to the Southern Claims Commission of his friend Carroll Jackson Brewer.

Joseph Sanders gravestone, photo by Gary B. Sanders

The grave is located under a tree at the end of County Road 111 in Jackson County. Local people call this site “Dolberry Hollow.” My sister and I visited the resting place of our ancestor in 2007. Today, one sees only a pastoral view of thriving fields of corn and mountain scenery. It is difficult to imagine the strife that engulfed the area at the time of Joseph Sanders’ death.

Also located across the road is the “Blowing Cave,” which is something of a local tourist attraction. A strong breeze blows from the cave, hence the name by which it has been known since before the Civil War. In her book Sanders and Bean Families: Past and Present Virginia Retan describes the Blowing Cave as follows:

Mother Nature provided an air conditioner during the terribly hot season of summer, known as the Blowing Cave. The cave was named Blowing Cave because of the cool breeze that forever flowed from the entrance in the summer and the warm breeze which flowed in the cooler months. This cave was, and is today, quite an attraction.

Inside the cave, there are many rooms. People have used the Blowing Cave many times for shelter from tornadoes and other storms. Unfortunately, many of the rooms have been washed away by great gushes of water which are known to come unexpectedly from the cave. Some people say that the end of the cave comes out in Winchester, Tennessee. Some have said that they have traveled all through the cave and it took them three or four days to reach the other side.

Now (1986), many groups enjoy exploring the cave, with experienced guides, of course. Scouts enjoy staying overnight there, checking out the remaining rooms of the cave. The cave is now posted and people enter at their own risk. Young couples used to take walks there on Sunday afternoons; even now in 1986, it is said there is evidence of courtships of days long ago, in the names carved on trees or scraped in the rocks at the entrance of the cave.

Although the cave is no longer open to the public (as of 2007, the time of my visit), one can still stand about several yards away and get a good view of the cave opening, and sometimes even feel the cool breeze from the cave, just as Uncle Joe Sanders and his family and friends probably used to do on hot summer days before the Civil War.

Gary B Sanders’ story is continued proof that Vikki’s blog attracts terrific writers. Interesting indeed. In particular, I appreciated the comment about the two unrelated Sanders and Saunders families of Randolph County NC (as proven by DNA,) and the subsequent confusion this has caused later generations of family researches. Been there. Done that. Two un-related Wilbourn and Welborn famillies also settled (same time frame) in Wilkes Co NC, among other places. Mercy! The trouble this causes later generations when families of the same surname settle into rural areas during the same era. Excellent work. Thank you, Gary!

This is a very interesting story, especially for me. My Mama’s family are Saunders from Tuckaseegee Valley NC. My 3X GGF Jordan Holland served from January 1863 to August 1863 with a Home Guard Unit called the Henry Mounted Rebels in Henry County Alabama, Afterward, he enlisted with the 22nd GA Heavy Artillery for the rest of the War. Page 89 of the History of Henry County Alabama(2002) states, “The Henry Mounted Rebels were organized to rid the Choctawhatchee River areas of Confederate Deserters led by Joseph Sanders. They terrorized local citizens all the way to the Florida line.” I am glad to hear the other side of the story. I am not sure how it really turned out, only that ole Jordan was with the group that hunted him. Only found that out yesterday at a library in Atlanta. I was doing a Google search on Joseph Sanders and the War in Alabama and came across this. Thanks for sharing.

Jon, I didn’t make the connection when I first read your comment, but I believe the Joseph Sanders who led a group of Confederate deserters in southern Alabama and Florida was Joseph Ganes Sanders who was born in 1827 in South Carolina and and who died in Georgia in 1867. At the beginning of the Civil War, he was living in Dale County, Alabama. There is a Wikipedia article about him. Another source describes him when he served at Gettysburg as “a backwoods unlettered farmer and millwright.” ( http://www.history-sites.com/cgi-bin/bbs62x/alcwmb/arch_config.pl?md=read;id=35432).

Gary, Thank you for sharing this. I now reside at the cave and take care of its visitors. For years I had heard many versions of the history and am delighted to come across this as it is by far the most accurate. Please contact me sometime as I would love to talk with you.

Nathan, thank you (and all the others who commented on my article) for the kind words. When I was at the cave in June 2007, I was told it was in the possession of John Dolberry, a second great grand nephew of Joseph Sanders. A quick Google search appears to show that it was acquired by the Southeastern Cave Conservancy in January 2008. Is this correct? At any rate, I would be very interested in exchanging information with you and will send a message to your e-mail address that Vikki provided.

I am a 3 greats back granddaughter of Joseph and would love to connect with you family to share my family line my great grandpa was John Crawfordberry Sanders hope I spelled that right ! Please contact me!

I’m sorry Gary. I believe my father had a brother named Gary, along with Tone Leo, Wayne, David, Aunt Wanda, Larry. My grandfather’s name was Tony Leo. His mother was Rebecca Jane e, whose mom was Malinda,daughter of Brittain. I visited my Grandmother Hazel Maddox in 1990. I was sad to see during my research that grandpa Joe Maddox from Lane a Virginia ia had passed away. I was born in New Port News Virginia. My mom’s name was Diane Renee Sutherland. I grew up in Pascagoula, Ms. I hope this helps. I REALLY ENJOY READING YOU ARTICLES

Hi I just recently moved to Pensacola and discovered my grandfather is Ernest Sanders, great great great grandson of Joseph Sanders through son Henry. I am truly interested in my southern history as I grew up in Seattle WA thinking I was Italian not a Sanders. Apparently my father had a falling out with family and changed his history to a stepparent. Please contact me anytime.

Please see my Web site for other information on our Sanders familyhttp://home.earthlink.net/~garybsanders/
There are several mentions there of your ancestor Henry A. Sanders who served in the 18th Ohio Regiment, Company B., and was wounded in the right shoulder at the Battle of Nashville. He survived the war, returned to Alabama, divorced his first wife, then married two more times and had eight children. Henry was described by one contemporary as a “red-headed Irishman.”

I am a relative to John Dolberry and have many fond memories as a child playing outside the “blowing cave” and drinking from the spring. My grandfather Marion Little is also buried at the nearby grave yard. I loved reading about my family history. Thank you.

Hi Gary Sanders,
Thanks for sharing the Sanders’ blood line. I really don’t know much about my family tree. I do have a U.S. WWII Draft Card with my grandfather’s name (Birl Sanders) on it. He lived in Eleazer, Randolph county (South of Asheboro near the Montgomery county line). I would love to find out more about my ancestry and DNA testing.

Hi Jimmy,
I don’t have your grandfather Birl listed in my files but send me a personal e-mail and we can discuss your descent from the Sanders of Randolph and Montgomery. Thanks.
–Garyhttp://home.earthlink.net/~garybsanders

Wow! my name is Jay Wilson. I live in Chattanooga Tn. My father was born @ Mud Creek near the blowing cave in 1933. He will be 81 in April. His mother (my grandmother) was Elizabeth Eliza Sanders. She was born Febuary 19, 1900 and died Febuary 21, 1998. I think she said she was John T. Dolberrys cousin. Her father was Jesse Sanders and I believe her mother was Sarah Jacks Sanders. Her siblings were Wallace, Annie, Ab, and Sally Sanders. Eliza married my grandfather James Riley Wilson from Fackler Al. I believe. I would be curious to know if you have any further info on where we all fit into this tree. Thanks, Jay Wilson

Hi Gary
My name is Jesse Sanders I live in Michigan. Jay Wilson is my cousin, his father is my uncle Gene. My father was his brother Jessie David Sanders who was born in 1920 in Mud Creek. He died in 1965. He served in the Army during World War II in Germany. He married twice and had four children Ronald David Sanders his oldest son,and Patricia Sanders with his first wife Gladys (Oakwood ) Sanders .
Me and my sister Sandra Sanders- White are from his second marriage to Gloria ( Opdycke ) Sanders. I believe from your research that I come from the line of John G Sanders, Uncle joes son.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Launch of Maxxia & Remserv Claims

The launch of the desktop and smartphone claiming platforms made claiming easier with automated processing and 24/7 access.

My role: Leading the design I worked closely with multiple teams to develop a solid visual story that succeeded in driving customers to these new platforms.

Claims app launch

Educational flyer, promotional material

Internal communications launched first to educate our customer facing employees. A visual guide to the app was desk dropped to staff on the internal launch day. 'Smart phone' chocolate bars came floor stickers were distributed around offices to add excitement and it helped to aid positive change.

Claims for desktop launch

Educational flyer, poster, DL, email template, digital banners

A flyer was distributed internally with the same intention of educating employees about the platform and the positive affect it will have on our customers. ​​​​​​​

After internal education, the second step was launching to our customers. A range of digital and print pieces were rolled out nationally across all offices, over 50 client sites and 300,000 customers with the main goal of converting customers from manual call centre claiming to online claiming.

The results

Within six month of launch over 65 per cent of customers were using the new platforms.

Both apps had over 22,000 downloads in two months.

The Maxxia desktop portal had over 1.1 million logins in six months.

These results in relieving the burden felt by the call centre who where manually entering and processing claims resulting in a more efficient process flow for the company.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Which Wedding Gown Style Is Perfect For Your Personality? (Quiz)

Like nearly every woman, you've had the perfect wedding gown dreamed up in your head since the first time you watched ""Cinderella"" at age 5.

Monthly Archives: February 2020

All month, I’ve been writing poems each morning to a theme via CLMOOC’s Poetry Port — a project designed to spread collaboration and support through various networks. Along with the daily writing, a number of us were writing poems for others — sometimes as unexpected gifts and sometimes for the recipient’s request. The Thinglink above is my curation of my own poems, some via audio and some via text.

Today, the last day, the daily poem theme was not Farewell, but instead, Welcome.

Kevin’s Note: I signed up for a month-long Digital Detox project out of Middlebury College and enjoyed the email updates throughout January that got us thinking about our digital lives, and offered small steps and actions to take. I made comics about the concepts as a way to read deeper and think a little more critically about the ways digital devices and platforms are part of our lives. This is the last comic I made for that project.

I made comics about the concepts as a way to read deeper and think a little more critically about the ways digital devices and platforms are part of our lives.

One of the many topics that come up when I read Christopher Paul Curtis’ novel The Watsons Go to Birmingham 1963 is the role of young people in the civil rights movement. Although the novel never references the Birmingham Children’s Crusade, the movie adaptation does, through the memory of some cousins of the Watson children, and so we spend time discussing how young people took the streets in protest, were attacked by police with fire canons and dogs, and were sent to jail by the hundreds.

Let The Children March, a picture book by author Monica Clark-Robinson and illustrator Frank Morrison is a powerful text companion to those discussions. With brilliant visuals and an engaging story (plus, a valuable timeline of 1963 in Alabama during the Civil Rights era), the book brings to the surface the courage of the kids who took to the streets, the wariness and worry of the parents who allowed the march (code-named D Day and Double D Day) to happen, and the movement leaders who accepted that children being arrested would create tension for the Kennedy White House to finally act against segregation.

The picture book centers on a narrator voice of a child who takes part in the Birmingham Children’s Crusade, but it more of a universal voice, advocating for change against unjust rules and putting the self in danger to force confrontation against a police force that was part of the problem, not the solution.

I appreciate how Let The Children March gives those young marchers a voice, and also, explores the results of the march (which the scenes in the Watsons movie does not do because of the time frame). President Kennedy did get involved after getting pressure from the country and the world. Birmingham did end official segregation (if not racial violence, as the bombing of the church that forms the center of the Watsons novel shows. Change happened, even if the results of those actions are still something we continue to reckon with as a country.

(This is for the Slice of Life challenge, hosted by Two Writing Teachers. We write on Tuesdays about the small moments in the larger perspective … or is that the larger perspective in the smaller moments? You write, too.)

I was wandering our small city’s downtown, a little bit bored and sort of wasting the hour. This is often when our attention to the small things of the world is at its finest — when we are not consumed by other tasks. I noticed the window of a public art gallery, and wandered in. I had time.

The latest art show in the gallery is called Tiny Pricks, and it features embroidery of President Trump’s craziest quotes, with art as the lens of protest. It’s both amazingly insightful and sadly alarming (the things Trump says). Along with the art on display, the gallery has hosted sessions for more embroidery for visitors. At a table, all of the materials were laid out, at rest, as if the embroidery team had just suddenly gone off on coffee break and would be back soon.

If I knew how to embroider with needle and thread and cloth, I might have sat down and continued their work. Instead, I kept making my way through the hanging wall displays. There must have been at least a 100 or more embroidered works of art.

I wandered in the gallery for some time, just staring at the embroidery and appreciating how art is a way for us to express our political views, and then wondering if projects like this will translate into votes in November. I eavesdropped in on other patrons, who seemed to be asking some of the same questions.

I left after a bit, still thinking about the artwork for hours later, which I suppose is a sign of the power of the embroidery, of the artists, to help us see the world — political, or otherwise — in a new way and to wonder about other paths forward.

I had this idea of going back to a poem that I wrote, rather quickly, for the theme of Memories for CLMOOC’s month of poetry, and think a bit deeper on why I wrote what I wrote. To be honest, the comment annotations are small — you can get a closer look here, if you want.

My hope was to uncover some of my intentions with the small poem, to surface some of my moves. I would not call this poem anything extraordinary or special or even one of my best poems this month, but there are elements of personal story and intentional rhyming, as well as regrets about the ending, that made this poem worth a second look. For me, anyway.

Last night was the second online session of an inquiry group project called The Grapple Series – hosted by the National Writing Project, Western Pennsylvania Writing Project and the CMU CREATE Lab — that is looking at the impact of AI and technology on our lives. The theme last night was algorithms and justice, a pairing that made for interesting conversations about how blind trust in both often lead to disastrous consequences.

We explored some interesting reading and video pieces before gathering in our online session. The articles explored the issue from multiple angles, but the overall connecting concepts are clear: algorithms are created people, and people have bias, and so algorithms have bias, too, and when algorithms are embedded with bias, it impacts our notions of justice in the world.

Sometimes, this is literal — as in the case of computer software being used to designate length of parole. Sometimes, it is more nuanced — the way search engines bring racial stereotypes to the surface. Sometimes it is not yet known — the way facial recognition is changing our sense of privacy in the public sphere.

The Grapple gathering began with a large discussion and writing about justice and algorithms, and then broke into smaller groups, where we engaged in deeper debate about the role of algorithms on society.

We also teamed up to create our own paper “algorithm” for fighting off the common cold, and while our group went a sort of silly route (Should a teacher call in sick or not?), the short flowchart activity reminded us how often we can fall into Yes/No binary decisions that can leave the humanity aspect out. Another small group did integrate ideas of humanity into their algorithm, and I found that quite interesting.

I appreciate being able to work through and “grapple” with these complex questions rippling through society. There is no real solution — the algorithmic genie is long gone from its bottle. But we can be aware, and make some decisions about how what information we share and how we are being manipulated by technology.

Second, this poem is for Ron, whose work as an artist is always interesting to me. He makes picture books and does daily artwork and sketches, and is always up for another connected adventure.

Ron and I know each other through CLMOOC and DS106 and other adventures. His poem began in digital format, but then I wanted a more static version, too.

Finally, this poem is for Raymond.

Our paths crossed years ago in CLMOOC, and I bought his small book of poems, a book that inspired the poem. We still interact now and then, and although I think our political views are quite different, I enjoy understanding Raymond’s perspective and reading his poetry.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The state's largely Democratic electorate, coupled with Warren's pulling women voters to her side, proved too much for Senator Brown to overcome.

Brown was popular and benefited in this ""blue"" state by avoiding lock-step votes with Senate Republicans. But unlike 2010, when he won his seat in a special election, this was a presidential year that brought out a broader array of the state's electorate. The race this year also brought in massive amounts of campaign contributions on both sides, as Republicans sought to defend a seat and Democrats sought to reclaim it.

Ms. Warren is a stalwart liberal who became known nationally as a crusader against the power of Wall Street banks and for her focus on the economic struggles of working-class families.

""It was exactly 50 years ago tonight that Ted Kennedy was first elected to the United States Senate,"" Warren told cheering supporters Tuesday night. ""We miss his passion, his commitment, his energy, and his fight for working families.""

Warren said that Mr. Kennedy's pledge back then – to devote all his strength and will to serving Bay State residents – is now hers as well.

Both candidates maintained a positive impression with voters during the campaign. Yet the campaign was also rife with negative ads.

Warren's ads appealed especially to women, and they did so successfully.

""Don't let Scott Brown put women's health at risk,"" one Warren flier warned as Election Day neared. The mailing said Brown had, among other things, ""stood with Republican extremists against Planned Parenthood, voting to limit access to preventive care.""

Warren also bored in on the national implications of the race, arguing that a vote for Brown would also be a vote for expanding the clout of Republicans in the Senate – many of whom are more conservative than Brown. She reminded voters that the next senator from Massachusetts could have a role to play in anointing Supreme Court nominees, and she sought to raise doubts about Brown's commitment to abortion rights.

Warren fended off attacks by Brown, including his questioning of her integrity during her academic career. She had listed herself as a minority in a directory of law-school professors for many years, then dropped the listing after gaining a position at Harvard Law School. Warren rejected the implication that she had used the listing to advance her career, and most voters didn't hold the issue against her.

After the hard-fought race, Brown was gracious in conceding defeat. ""She won it fair and square folks,"" he told his campaign staff. ""May she bring that Senate office great credit.""

Warren, too, sounded a magnanimous note. She said although Brown's supporters didn't vote for her, she embraced his message of being ready to work across party lines. ""I promise I'm going to work to earn your support,"" Warren said.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"LINE’s Webtoon app updates its comics daily, and is optimized for mobile platforms without data restrictions, as you can download them over wifi and read them on the subway or at the Javitz Center, which is a data deadzone. It is available now via Google Playstore and the Apple store.

The app launched in Korea in 2004, and launched in the US in 2014. It already has millions of users in both Korea and the US.

The app will work with pros and with amateurs in a “challenge league.” The editorial team elevates some of the most popular webtoons to pro status, so its a good place to try and break in, if you’re so inclined.

Matt Hawkins is launching a branch of his comic Cyber Force on the LINE Webtoon app in November which will run for 52 weeks. Cyber Force: Powers will fit into his work that is existing currently in trades (the first two volumes of which are readily available on the apl now, with one chaoter releasing every week), as well as the anime Witchblade, The Darkness video games, and Aphrodite Nine.

Hawkins did accidentally spoil the news that there will be a third in The Darkness franchise.

Michelle Phan’s webtoon Helios Femina will be about an alchemist who needs to find a songstress and from there embark on some kind of “odyssey.” Phan was much more excited to discuss how excited she is by the app. For those interested, she hand draws the comic, scans it, and inks it digitally. She posts photos of her process on SnapChat.

Dean Haspiel is a veteran webcomic artist. His webtoon New Brooklyn is a superhero story in the spirit of “What if Jack Kirby and Alex Toth got together?” The impetus of Haspiel’s story were the white flags on the Brooklyn Bridge last year, and thus New Brooklyn is a story about Brooklyn being a sentient being that creates superheroes and villains. It is very much an outlet for Haspiel’s tech fatigue and malaise “What if Brooklyn has gotten fed up with the world and technology?”

Rob Feldman is working on two webtoons for LINE, horror tale Chiller and Sci-Fi-meets-Evil Kineval-meets-UltraMan story Cyko KO. Chiller relies on sound effects from the FXToonEditor available to all Webtoon creators. Cyko KO was originally born as an animated series.

Stephen McCraine’s Space Boy was the winner of the first challenge league contest. He called the challenge a “comics marathon” with no time to worry or over-plan.

The top four comics get a publishing deal with LINE. The third contest is running now, sponsored by Stan Lee. Submissions close December 13, 2015. Submissions require the first three chapters of a webtoon.

Has quietly been working at Bleeding Cool for over three years. He has written comics for Image, Top Cow, Shadowline, Avatar, IDW, Dynamite, Moonstone, Humanoids and Zenescope. He is the author of the Lucius Fogg series of novels and a published photographer.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"I am quite sure that when we hear of Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol, most of us think of speck, strudel, and Muller-Thurgau. The same happens with the denomination of Veneto Valpolicella, which recalls some good red wines. Despite this, it should surprise no one that some portions of these two regions are devoted to the cultivation of olive trees and the production of great extra virgin olive oils.

I am glad when people open the bottle of my oil and get excited.- Monica Vaccarella

There is a part of the province of Trento which is tempered by the mitigating effects of Lake Garda and enjoys a sub-Mediterranean climate with moderately cold winters and hot summers, ideal conditions for growing olive trees up to an altitude of 300 meters (984.2 ft).

Olio Cru’s olive groves in Arco, Trento

A few miles from the northern shores of the lake, in the territories of Arco, Bolognano and Massone, lush olive groves give life to 7c, an olive oil producer and three-time Gold Award winner at the New York International Olive Oil Competition (including one Best in Class in 2016).

“2,000 plants, mostly Casaliva, lie on the slopes of the hill overlooking the town of Arco, partly rooted on terraces and partly flourishing on the rough hillside,” said the head of manufacturing, Massimo Azzolini. “The challenging terrain makes harvest complex, and even though we can use mechanical facilitators in some plots, a large part of work is by hand,” he pointed out.

Harvest usually starts in the last week of October; the liquid gold that comes out is light-to-medium fruity, moderately spicy and bitter, with hints of almond, artichoke, and grass. “Part of our product is made with de-pitted olives that must be picked when they are at least 70 percent green,” Azzolini explained, adding that the harvest must be anticipated to catch fruits at the beginning of veraison, in order to obtain a product characterized by decisive pungency and fruitiness.

Olio Cru

As we move to Veneto, Valpolicella is the protected designation of origin of an extra virgin olive oil produced in the area situated on the right side of the Adige river. Monica Vaccarella manages 1.5 hectares (3.7 acres) of olive grove with 500 plants at an altitude of 400 meters (1,312 feet), in Avesa, between the Val Borago and the Val Gavina.

Two steps away from Verona, the native varieties Grignano and Favarol flank the more widespread Frantoio, Pendolino, Leccino and Leccio del Corno. “I produce two blends, of which the Veneto Valpolicella PDO is my flagship,” said Vaccarella, as she explained that she combines 60 percent of local cultivars with the other ones in accordance with the product specification of the protected denomination of origin which requires that at least half of the extra virgin olive oil consists of native types.

Monica Vaccarella during harvest

“These two local varieties make the oil enjoyable, while the early harvest gives energy to it and allows the taste to expand with formidable bitterness and pungency,” our producer said while describing her extra virgin olive oil with aromas of white fruit, grass and basil.

The olive trees were planted by her father Angelo 27 years ago, and she started to manage the olive grove in 2010. They carry out a so-called balanced pruning which helps to avoid biological alternation of high and low yields. “It is a painstaking and draining work which takes two months since we operate on the smallest branches,” Vaccarella revealed.

However, the flat landscape facilitates harvest and in one day they can collect 800 to 1,000 kilograms (1,764-2,205 pounds) of olives. “We crush them within 6 hours, that is the only way to get the most out of the fruits and reach such a low level of acidity,” she remarked. “I am glad when people open the bottle of my oil and get excited.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

SparkFun Ambient Light Sensor Breakout - TEMT6000

Description: Basic breakout board for the TEMT6000 Ambient Light Sensor. Only what you need, nothing you don’t. Sensor acts like a transistor - the greater the incoming light, the higher the analog voltage on the signal pin.

Customer Comments

I had a question about the output this sensor gives off…
I’m using it with a basic stamp 2pe microcontroller and haven’t been sure how to convert the analog output into lux. Is there a specific equation I have to use for this or are there several (like ones that include temperature, etc)?

Although the datasheet does not provide this information, an email to Vishay got some dynamic response data. The upshot is that for the fastest response to changing light conditions one must have a high current flowing through the device. Icmax is defined at 20ma. With the 10K resistor (assuming no current out the signal line), and a 5 volt supply, than the maximum collector current is 5/10K or a tiny 500 micro amps. At this condition, rise and fall times are around 15 micro seconds. Increase Ic (by lowering the value of the resistor) and you can drop the times to bellow 10 usec.

SFE, how about a breakout board with this sensor and a logarithmic amplifier? I don’t care for the difference between 100 lux and 105 lux, which you won’t notice anyway, but I do care about the difference between 10 lux, 100 lux and 1000 lux. Log amp, please!

With a photoresistor you build a voltage divider which is anything but linear, this one is linear. Also, a phototransistor has a much wider range and is faster. Phototransistors are being used to trigger slave strobe light in photostudios, a photoresistor is orders of magnitude too slow for this.

Would this be a good device for measuring and data logging sunlight in a garden? Also, is there a waterproof version, or a good way to waterproof this without diffusing the light from hitting the sensor? Thanks!

Amazingly simple to use.
I’m using it as a trigger in a spectrometer, gives the go signal when the emission starts.
highly stable and incredibly easy to work with. Only problem is, my fingers are too big

Remarkable. I swapped this in place of a potentiometer in my Arduino project and it worked exactly as expected without any changes. It’s great to have this as a breakout.
Now I have to modify the software to provide some dampening.

I would like to use this in an application where I need much higher resolution, but it won’t need to measure more than 2 lux or so. If I just put a big resistor on the ground pin, will that effectively multiply the voltage on the signal pin? Also, while this won’t need to actively measure more than 2 lux, it will still regularly be exposed to 100+ lux while it’s on. If putting the resistor on there will fry a 5V picaxe I/O pin, it won’t work.
If this doesn’t work, I’d appreciate any ideas for something that would. I would just use a CdS photoresistor, but linearity is very helpful.

"Seeding Change in Weather Modification Globally

Seeding Change in Weather Modification Globally

Operational programmes to modify the weather – including to disperse fog, enhance rain and snowfall, and suppress hail – are taking place in more than 50 countries worldwide. Since the discovery in the late 1940s that crystals of silver iodide can form ice crystals in some water vapor, scientists have been working to understand how to alter the way water forms and moves within a cloud. Despite decades of research, deep skepticism still surrounds cloud seeding due, in part, to the challenge of verifying the efficacy of the technique – establishing cause and effect – given the complexity and variability of weather systems.

Warm or cold, polluted or clean, over a mountain or a field, a cloud’s characteristics are key to the success or failure of cloud seeding efforts. New tools are enabling meteorologists to study and understand clouds and their modification with greater precision than ever, while new technologies such as nanotechnology are expanding the possibilities for the field. Bolstered by an international drive for research and funding to secure water resources, scientists are cautiously working to modernize rainmaking for the 21st century.

“Water is the basic sustenance of life on Earth, with water and the air we breathe as the two primary issues in this century,” says Dr. Roelof Bruintjes of the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and chair of the WMO Expert Team on Weather Modification. “Improving our understanding of cloud and precipitation processes are the number one priority and the better we understand them, the better we can potentially impact cloud processes with cloud seeding.”

The fundamental challenge of weather modification is identifying and locating the best clouds for the job. Without clouds, these technologies are powerless. While “cloud seeding could be a tool to enhance water resources, it is not a ‘drought busting’ because we need clouds,” says Bruintjes, whose early training in weather modification was in South Africa. “Nobody can make a cloud or chase away a cloud.”

“The basic concept of weather modification, especially precipitation enhancement, is to find a rate-limiting process related to the conversion of cloud water to precipitation in natural clouds, and to bypass it with a minimum level of artificial stimulation,” says Dr. Masataka Murakami of the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research at Nagoya University in Japan. “Therefore, it is important to find the clouds that have the potential to precipitate but cannot exert that ability.”

Indeed, says Dr. Abdullah Al Mandoos, director of the National Centre for Meteorology and Seismology in the United Arab Emirates (UAE): “Any country that has a plan to implement cloud seeding projects needs to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the frequent and available clouds in their territory.”

Part of finding the “right” clouds depends of the temperature. Increasing precipitation requires one of two approaches to help water particles collide, merge, and grow: glaciogenic seeding and hygroscopic seeding. Glaciogenic seeding uses agents, such as silver iodide, that initiate ice formation in “cold clouds,” those colder than 0 °C and that have supercooled water. Because silver iodide has a crystalline shape similar to natural ice, it can create ice earlier in the lifetime of a cloud, giving it more time to grow precipitation-sized particles.In “warm clouds,” convective clouds with large parts warmer than -10 °C, scientists can use hygroscopic seeding, generally with a simple salt. The salt helps water droplets to collide and produce rain.

For either glaciogenic or hygroscopic seeding, it is essential to determine if clouds in a region are already efficient or if cloud seeding can potentially make a difference. “The main cloud seeding methods provide centers for drops and ice crystals to form on,” Bruintjes says. “If these particles already exist in optimal size and concentration in some regions of the world, cloud seeding would not have an impact.”

The location of the clouds is also highly significant. Clouds in the tropics differ from clouds in the mid-latitudes because temperature influences how cloud processes operate. “In addition, clouds in different regions with different levels of pollution can also develop precipitation differently – and even in one region depending on the pollution on a specific day,” Bruintjes says. Anything that alters clouds can affect seeding.

Some of the most successful cases of cloud seeding in the world have happened in mountainous regions, with glaciogenic seeding of “orographic” clouds. In these regions, clouds form from air flowing over mountains. They are an especially attractive target for cloud seeding because high-elevation snowpacks can store water for a region year-round.

In Japan, for example, where water shortage is a transient, not chronic, problem, Murakami says that glaciogenic seeding of orographic snow clouds can be a preventive measure in late spring and early summer. Such operational programmes can be conducted “once the long-term prediction of precipitation becomes more accurate and reliable and when we can predict water shortage with a lead time of a few months,” he says.

Bruintjes and Murakami point to examples of snowpack enhancement projects in Wyoming, USA, and the Snowy Mountains in Australia. In the Snowy Mountains, scientists have been using glaciogenic seeding on cold fronts to the west of the mountains. In the colder months, ground-based generators spray a mixture of silver iodide that the winds carry east to clouds over the mountains. In an analysis of results from the initial 2005-2009 experiment, researchers found a positive, but not statistically significant, impact of seeding on snowfall; however, they found the targeting of the seeding efforts “unequivocally successful”, with levels of silver iodide higher in seeded areas compared to unseeded ones. A secondary analysis showed enhanced levels of seeding materials that suggested additional ice particles and thus an impact on cloud precipitation processes. The project continues to this date, well beyond the initial trials. Some reports suggest that snowfall has increased by up to 14%.

Measuring the impact of cloud seeding initiatives is challenging. “Usually we revert to a randomized experiment similar to what is used in the medical community when they test a new drug,” Bruintjes says. Like in a medical experiment, where no two people are alike, “no cloud is the same as another, and there are many factors that can play a role in the development of precipitation in a cloud.”

Over the last 10 years, cloud seeding experiments have benefited from advances in numerical models that can simulate seeding more accurately, as well as improved observational tools to understand the physical processes in clouds due to seeding. These tools include more precise satellite capability and ground-based and airborne dual-polarization radars that can better measure precipitation size.

“Although not perfect, it has been a great step forward,” Bruintjes says. “As we get better at weather prediction, we can better predict a change.”

Another member of the WMO Expert Team on Weather Modification, Andrea Flossmann of Observatoire de Physique du Globe de Clermont Ferrand in France, says that researchers have been working to improve the statistical approaches necessary to validate the randomized approach. “Still, reliable campaigns remain costly, requiring numerous test clouds, both seeded and not,” she says.

One such group is Murakami’s research team, which received a 2015 grant award from the UAE Research Programme for Rain Enhancement Science. “We are working to better evaluate, and ultimately improve, the effectiveness of precipitation enhancement in arid and semi-arid regions through a sound scientific research consisting of data analysis, laboratory experiments, field observation and numerical modelling,” he says. A major aim of the work is to clarify the microphysical structures of clouds suitable for seeding and their occurrence frequency over the eastern mountain areas of the UAE.

UAE Research Programme for Rain Enhancement Science

Rain enhancement in the UAE

The US$ 5 million UAE Research Programme for Rain Enhancement Science launched in 2015 as an international initiative to advance the research and technology of rain enhancement. According to its director, Alya Al Mazroui, the program has two goals: to boost research in rain enhancement worldwide, and to increase rainfall in the UAE and other arid and semi-arid regions in the world.

Water is a critical issue in the UAE with its 10 000 year-old groundwater supplies running low, and demand for water expected to double in the next 15 years by some estimates. Desalinated seawater accounts for 40% of the country’s water supply. With the high cost of desalination, the UAE has been conducting cloud seeding as a possible lower-cost alternative. In 2016, UAE undertook 177 cloud seeding operations, mostly using hygroscopic seeding in the eastern mountain ranges on the border with Oman to raise levels in aquifers and reservoirs. According to a report from 2015, greater-than-normal cloud cover enabled more missions that year.

As part of its rain enhancement program, the UAE is working to lead the way for greater investments and technological advancements in weather modification. Al Mandoos says he is proud of the “UAE as a global hub that develops the best technologies that contribute to the water shortage solutions.”

In addition to the award to Murakami’s team for improving cloud seeding validation, other recipients of the 2015 award were projects to “use nanotechnology to manufacture more effective seeding materials and land cover modification to enhance the confluence areas and improve the convection initiation,” says Al Mandoos. Using nanotechnology, researchers could potentially create new chemicals for cloud seeding that better mimic the crystalline structure of ice at a nanoscale. The UAE Program team is working with awardees over the next three years to help them implement their research projects.

Al Mandoos of the UAE points to the WMO Guiding Principles for the Planning of Weather Modification Activities as an important resource for countries looking to improve water security. “The guidelines state that countries that practice cloud seeding must investigate seeded and unseeded clouds through a statistical randomization method,” he says. “The outcome of this statistical randomization process must then be supported with an analysis that validates the original cloud seeding operations.”

Caution advised

The 2015 WMO Statement on Weather Modification also discusses weather modification techniques to suppress hail and disperse fog, and it mentions recent interest in climate engineering. “Recently, seeding has been proposed as a climate mitigation strategy, to increase cloud brightness and increase the part of solar radiation reflected into space,” Flossmann says. The WMO report offers caution for such global-scale efforts, pointing out the historical difficulties in proving cause and effect for seeding interventions at the local scale.

Global-scale cloud seeding does have a historical precedence but in an unexpected way: through inadvertent weather modification. For example, volcanic eruptions have injected particles into stratosphere that have reduced temperatures globally for 2 to 3 years after the eruptions (e.g. such eruptions are thought to have contributed to the “little ice age” in the 19th century). As another example of inadvertent weather modification, Flossmann says that satellites have observed that particles released by ship chimneys modify cloud properties of the stratocumulus cloud deck above, appearing to brighten the clouds.

For all weather modification – intentional or not – it is important to remember that “the atmosphere has no walls,” Flossmann says. “What you add may not have the desired effect in your vicinity, but by being transported along might have undesired effects elsewhere.”

But above all, it’s all about the clouds. “There is no one-size-fits-all solution,” she says. “It depends very much on the specific cloud whether adding particles to it will have any effect at all, and if it has an effect that it is in the desired direction.”

Award Winners of the UAE Rain Enhancement Programme - The United Arab Emirates announced the winners of the Rain Enhancement Programme on 17 January. The US$5 million funding went to Professor Giles Harrison of the University of Reading, Professor Hannele Korhonen of the Finnish Meteorological Institute and Dr Paul Lawson of SPEC Inc.

<p><b>DejalNews 2019-02</b>, <i>issue #75</i></p>
<h4>Welcome</h4>
<p>This is <i>DejalNews</i>, an occasional newsletter from <a href=""/"">Dejal</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>If you want to receive these newsletters in your email inbox, head over to the <a href=""/subscribe/"">DejalNews subscribe page</a> to sign up.</b></i></p>
<h4>Time Out tips</h4>
<p>So far I've been sticking to my goal of a <a href=""/blog/"">Dejal blog post</a> each week. No idea if I can keep it up, but I want to try.</p>
<p>Following the <a href=""/blog/2019/01/dejalnews-74-its-back"">previous <i>DejalNews</i> newsletter</a>, a couple of weeks ago I <a href=""/blog/2019/02/time-out-tip-dry-eye-blink-reminders"">posted a Time Out tip to help with dry eyes</a>, and last week I <a href=""/blog/2019/02/time-out-tip-lifetime-supporter"">posted about making your own lifetime supporter option</a>. Check out those posts if you missed them.</p>
<h4>Auto-renewing Time Out supporter option?</h4>
<p>Speaking of the Time Out supporter options, there's something I've been considering for a while. As you may know, currently the 3-, 6-, and 12-month supporter options are one-time payments; they don't automatically renew. Which is fine for many people, who either only want to buy once, or want to choose when to renew. But lots of customers do renew their support when it expires, which I greatly appreciate.</p>
<p>So I was wondering if people would like and use an option to automatically renew their supporter status. To be clear, this would be completely optional, in addition to the current non-renewing choices.</p>
<p>I've created <a href=""/poll/2019/02/timeout-auto-renew"">a poll to ask about this option</a>.</p>
<p>I know this newsletter doesn't have a huge readership (since I removed the old subscribers rather than risk anyone thinking it spam), but I would really appreciate it if everyone who reads this would vote on this poll. Thank you.</p>

<p><a href=""/timeout/""><img src=""/timeout/images/icon.png"" align=""right"" /></a>In ye olde days, software was sold once, for what would be considered nowadays to be a high price, and every year or so the developer would release a major paid upgrade, typically charging about half of the original price.</p>
<p>I still do this for <a href=""/simon/"">Simon</a>, my pro tool to monitor websites and servers for changes or failures, since that model is still common for pro apps. Though it is also available on <a href=""https://go.setapp.com/stp124?refAppID=201&amp;stc=site&amp;utm_medium=available_on_setapp_button&amp;utm_source=201&amp;utm_campaign=blog"">Setapp</a>, as part of a subscription along with hundreds of other apps.</p>
<p>But for <a href=""/timeout/"">Time Out</a>, my popular break reminder app, I wanted to try something different. I introduced a ""supporter"" model, where people can get the main features completely free, but be rewarded for supporting ongoing development with extra features. </p>
<p>Unlike old-school purchases, the supporter purchases are much cheaper, only a few bucks, and for a specific period of time, 3, 6, or 12 months. The extra features can be tried for an hour at a time, or are unlocked permanently with any supporter level. The ""catch"", such as it is, is that when I update the app, I may add new features that are only available to current supporters, so if your support has expired, you won't get those features unless you renew your support. Of course, you can try them, to help decide if you want to renew.</p>
<p>That seems really fair to me; you can have breaks for free, or get extra features cheaply, and if you like my improvements, you can help pay for their development. Or continue using the older features forever without paying more.</p>
<p>Win/win &mdash; you get a useful app that is regularly improved, and I get to eat. I also don't have to hold back major features for a big paid upgrade; I can add things whenever desired.</p>
<p>Even so, I occasionally get people asking about a lifetime purchase option. I don't currently offer that, since I feel it would be detrimental to the long-term survival of the app. However, you can effectively make your own lifetime option, by purchasing multiple 12-month supporter statuses. Each one you purchase will extend your supporter status by a year. So if you envision using Time Out for the next 5 years, purchasing 5 times will extend your support that long. Or whatever duration you want to use.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s worth reiterating that you don't have to pay more than once if you don't want to. You can become a supporter at whatever level you feel comfortable with, and not pay again unless you want to show your appreciation (kinda like a tip jar). After your supporter status expires, all of the advanced features that you had when you were a supporter will remain available permanently. You’d only need to renew if I add new features in the future that you want to use.</p>

<p><a href=""/timeout/""><img src=""/timeout/images/icon.png"" align=""right"" /></a>People use <a href=""/timeout/"">Time Out</a> for lots of reasons; to avoid RSI, to get regular exercise, to avoid sore eyes, to remember to eat regularly, to stop work at the end of the day, and more. But one use case that I've seen several people mentioning recently is to help with dry eyes.</p>
<p>A nice comment from one example:</p>
<blockquote><p>
""...my eyes are freakishly dry, way over-the-top compared to the average dry eye patient, and your app has allowed me to use my computer longer without killing my eyes. I can't thank you enough for making it!!""
</p></blockquote>
<p>People who experience dry eyes can sometimes find that blinking more frequently can help keep the eyes lubricated. That can be hard to remember when focused on work, though. Time Out's default Micro break can help with that, but some people prefer even more frequent reminders.</p>
<p>Time Out breaks can currently be configured to occur as much as once per minute, which is a lot for a typical break, but by making the break only last one second, and configuring the other <b>Schedule</b> settings to avoid skipping or delaying it, the break can be a very brief reminder without being too disruptive:</p>
<p><a href=""/files/2019/timeout/dry-eye/schedule.png"" title=""Click for full size.""><img src=""/files/2019/timeout/dry-eye/schedule.png"" alt=""Time Out schedule page"" width=""100%"" border=""0"" /></a></p>
<p>In the next version of Time Out, I am considering enabling using frequency units of seconds, instead of minutes (and hours, etc). It is currently limited to a minimum of 1 minute, as that seemed like a reasonable minimum, but a very quick break like this every few seconds does have merit. But read on for a way this can be achieved even now.</p>
<p>The <b>Appearance</b> options can be set to avoid fading the screen via the <b>None</b> theme, with zero fade-in and fade-out times (set the fade times before changing the theme):</p>
<p><a href=""/files/2019/timeout/dry-eye/appearance.png"" title=""Click for full size.""><img src=""/files/2019/timeout/dry-eye/appearance.png"" alt=""Time Out appearance page"" width=""100%"" border=""0"" /></a></p>
<p>A great way to very quickly remind yourself to blink is to flash the screen. This can be done via the <b>Flash Screen</b> action. The color and duration of the flash can be tweaked as desired.</p>
<p>And if once per minute isn't enough, you can add as many as you want on the <b>Actions</b> page, spaced out by setting the offset <b>After Start</b>, like this to have it flash every 10 seconds:</p>
<p><a href=""/files/2019/timeout/dry-eye/actions.png"" title=""Click for full size.""><img src=""/files/2019/timeout/dry-eye/actions.png"" alt=""Time Out actions page"" width=""100%"" border=""0"" /></a></p>
<p>I hope this is helpful to people suffering from dry eye, or anyone wanting more frequent reminders.</p>

<p><b>DejalNews 2019-01</b>, <i>issue #74</i></p>
<h4>Welcome</h4>
<p>This is <i>DejalNews</i>, an occasional newsletter from <a href=""/"">Dejal</a>.</p>
<p><i><b>If you want to receive these newsletters in your email inbox, head over to the <a href=""/subscribe/"">DejalNews subscribe page</a> to sign up.</b></i></p>
<h4>DejalNews is back!</h4>
<p>The previous issue of <i>DejalNews</i> was a bit over a year ago. I didn't intend to take a year off publishing these newsletters, but sometimes things just happen. I want to get back on that horse, so hopefully will resume publishing a newsletter each month. Usually they will cover recent releases and news, but I've got a bit of catching up to do this time.</p>
<h4>Simon 4.3.1, Time Out 2.5</h4>
<p>Since it's been a while since the previous newsletter, I should mention the updates to my main two apps, <a href=""/simon/"">Dejal Simon</a> version 4.3.1, and <a href=""/timeout/"">Time Out</a> version 2.5. If you missed them, take a look at the release notes or <a href=""/blog/release"">blog</a> for what changed.</p>
<h4>Introducing SheetPlanner</h4>
<p>An exciting new Mac app was introduced recently: <a href=""/consulting/sheetplanner/"">SheetPlanner</a>. This app was written by me as a consulting project. It is a pro-level outliner, planner, todo, calendar, and more.</p>
<p>Version 1.0 of this app was well-received, and we're working on some great enhancements for version 1.1 and beyond. Check it out!</p>
<h4>Summary blog posts</h4>
<p>A great resource to catch up with or review what happened in the past year are my traditional end-of-year blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""/blog/2019/01/featured-blog-posts-2018"">Featured blog posts of 2018</a>: highlighting a few interesting posts from 2018.</li>
<li><a href=""/blog/2019/01/dejal-year-review-2018"">Dejal year in review: 2018</a>: summarizing updates to Dejal and consulting apps in 2018.</li>
<li><a href=""/blog/2019/01/looking-ahead-2019"">Looking ahead: 2019</a>: trying to predict what's coming up this year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Personal blogs</h4>
<p>But wait, there's more! Blogs, that is. Perhaps one reason for the hiatus of newsletters is that I've been publishing a lot more on my personal blogs, fulfilling that creative outlet. If you want to learn a bit more about the man behind the apps, my non-Dejal projects and interests, check out my other blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://dejus.com/"">Dejus</a> is my personal blog, where I post a photo every day, and other short tweet-like comments. If you follow one blog, this the the one; everything gets linked from here.</li>
<li><a href=""https://yellowcottagehomestead.com/"">Yellow Cottage Homestead</a> is a blog that has longer posts about goings on around the homestead of my wife and I, featuring a weekly #Caturday post with pictures of the feral cats we care for, plus our chickens, bees, building projects, and other homestead topics. If you want to see what I build when not building apps, this is the place.</li>

<p><a href=""/timeout/""><img src=""/timeout/images/icon.png"" align=""right"" /></a>There's a recent meme going around called <a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%2310YearChallenge"">#10YearChallenge</a>, where people post pictures (often of themselves) from 2009 and 2019.</p>
<p>While I usually don't bother with memes, I thought it'd be fun to look at <a href=""/timeout/"">Time Out</a> from 2009 vs 2019.</p>
<p>Here's what a Time Out break looked like back in 2009, plus you can see the old app icon during the break (no other themes!):</p>

<p>Last week I published my annual <a href=""/blog/2019/01/dejal-year-review-2018"">Dejal year in review</a> post for 2018. This week, let's look ahead for what's in store for 2019.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a complete rewrite of <a href=""/pack/"">Pack</a>, my simple packing list app. It was originally written in Objective-C, using some legacy techniques and technologies, but I decided to rewrite it from scratch using Swift and modern approaches. It's usually not a good idea to rewrite working code, but this app is small enough, and the code crusty enough, that I deemed it worthwhile. I use this app every time I travel, so I'm keen to keep it fresh and current, and add some great new features... hopefully including iCloud syncing, though we'll see how that goes.</p>
<p>Next up I will start on <a href=""/timeout/"">Time Out</a> version 2.6, with a number of enhancements planned, and several more queued up for future versions. If you have any requests for 2.6 or later, now would be a great time to <a href=""/contact/?prod=timeout&amp;ref=summary&amp;subj=Time+Out+2.6+suggestion"">get in touch</a>.</p>
<p>Fun fact: this week Time Out is the top featured app in the Mac App Store, with <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/story/id1446914963"">a great feature story</a>. (That link will take you to the story in the App Store on a Mac or iOS device.)</p>
<p>I also have a couple of new apps in various states of planning or prototyping; one for macOS, another for iOS. Handy tools to scratch my own itch, which can sometime be a great way to work on an app, though not necessarily a key to commercial success. I hope to get to one or both of those later in the year.</p>
<p>And let's not forget <a href=""/simon/"">Simon</a>; I have some big enhancements planned for its next release, too.</p>
<p>On the <a href=""/consulting/"">consulting</a> side, I'm continuing to work on <a href=""/consulting/sheetplanner/"">SheetPlanner</a>, <a href=""/consulting/newsblur/"">NewsBlur</a>, and other client projects this year, with some great new releases coming up.</p>
<p>I've noticed that <a href=""/blog/"">the Dejal blog</a> was a bit neglected last year, with relatively few posts, and I haven't done a <a href=""/subscribe/"">DejalNews newsletter</a> for a while, so I want to get back into those; I've set a goal to do one post per week, and one newsletter per month, so please hold me to that! I also want to do some improvements to the website this year. (I guess I satisfied my blogging needs with my <a href=""https://dejus.com/"">personal</a> and <a href=""https://yellowcottagehomestead.com/"">homestead</a> blogs, but I don't want to ignore the Dejal one too.)</p>
<p>In terms of conferences, last year I attended <a href=""http://altconf.com"">AltConf</a> in San Jose and <a href=""https://swiftbynorthwest.com"">Swift by Northwest</a> in Portland. This year I'm considering entering the lottery for <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/"">WWDC</a>, since it'll likely have a strong Mac focus, but plan to attend AltConf again if I don't get in. I'd also like to attend other conferences, to be determined.</p>
<p>It's going to be another busy year!</p>

<blockquote class=""twitter-tweet"" data-lang=""en""><p lang=""en"" dir=""ltr""><a href=""https://twitter.com/dejal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@dejal</a> Love TimeOut! Just noticed on the appstore screenshots an example that shows &quot;Lunch&quot;. Could you share the set up for a daily lunch break at lunch time (rather than a rolling time frame)</p>
<p>&mdash; Abbey Jackson (@earthabbey) <a href=""https://twitter.com/earthabbey/status/1062909036486524929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">November 15, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<script async src=""https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"" charset=""utf-8""></script><p>Sure! Here's the <b>Schedule</b> page for my <a href=""/timeout/"">Time Out</a> preferences, showing my <b>Lunchtime</b> break configuration:</p>
<p><a href=""/files/2018/timeout/lunchtime.png"" title=""Click for full size.""><img src=""/files/2018/timeout/lunchtime.png"" alt=""Lunchtime schedule screenshot"" width=""100%"" border=""0"" /></a></p>
<p>There are two important steps to do this: firstly, set the frequency to <b>Every 1 day</b>, and secondly, use the <b>Available</b> options to set a fixed start time of noon. In my example, I have this break only occur on weekdays. I also have the natural break option set to <b>Continue Countdown</b>, since I want the break to start immediately, not get pushed back due to idle time.</p>
<p>Didn't realize that you can set daily breaks? Yep! Click, arrow, or tab to the units of the duration (""Break for"") and frequency (""Every"") fields to change between various units: seconds, minutes, hours for the duration, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years for the frequency.</p>
<p>As a bonus, here's my <b>Night</b> break, that tells me to go to bed:</p>
<p><a href=""/files/2018/timeout/night.png"" title=""Click for full size.""><img src=""/files/2018/timeout/night.png"" alt=""Night schedule screenshot"" width=""100%"" border=""0"" /></a></p>
<p>This is similar, but a longer duration. And yes, I go to bed rather early, as I usually get up at 05:30 (but don't get to my Mac till after breakfast).</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p><a href=""/timeout/""><img src=""/timeout/images/icon.png"" align=""right"" /></a>I'm pleased to announce the general release of version 2.5 of <a href=""/timeout/"">Time Out</a>, my popular break reminder tool.</p>
<p>The most obvious change in version 2.5 is dark mode support on Mojave (macOS 10.14):</p>
<p><a href=""/files/2018/timeout/2.5/schedule.png"" title=""Click for full size.""><img src=""/files/2018/timeout/2.5/schedule.png"" alt=""Mojave dark mode schedule screenshot"" width=""100%"" border=""0"" /></a></p>
<p>Isn't that pretty?</p>
<p>In addition to Mojave compatibility, this update also includes a new option on the <b>Break Schedule</b> page of the preferences to choose which days of the week a break is available. Eagle-eyed people may have noticed it in the above screenshot:</p>
<p><img src=""/files/2018/timeout/2.5/schedule-avail.png"" alt=""Mojave dark mode schedule screenshot"" width=""100%"" border=""0"" /></p>
<p>Using this option, you could indicate that breaks should only occur on weekdays, as above, or only Fridays, or any other combination. The days of the week can combine with a time range, or apply all day on the indicated days. This new feature is available as a reward for current supporters, or you can try it as often as you like, for an hour at a time.</p>
<p>(Don't worry, the first day of the week will respect your System Preferences; if you consider that the week starts on Sunday, for example, that'll be first in the control.)</p>
<p>Another new supporter option is on the <b>Advanced</b> preferences page: the ability to disable the app switcher, force quit, and shut down panels during a break:</p>
<p><img src=""/files/2018/timeout/2.5/advanced.png"" alt=""Mojave dark mode advanced screenshot"" width=""100%"" border=""0"" /></p>
<p>Most people probably don't need this, but if you need a little extra encouragement to avoid skipping breaks, this might be helpful, when combined with existing options to disable the postpone and skip buttons.</p>
<p>There are of course a number of other enhancements and fixes. I recommend everyone update to this version.</p>
<p>Here are the full release notes:</p>
<h4>Mojave dark mode and compatibility</h4>
<ul>
<li>All of the app content has been updated to support dark mode on macOS 10.14.</li>
<li>Built for Mojave (macOS 10.14), but still compatible back to Yosemite (10.10).</li>
</ul>
<h4>New option to choose which days of the week a break is available</h4>
<ul>
<li>Renamed the <b>Break Schedule Available</b> options to ""Every Day"" and ""Between"", and added a new ""All Day"" option.</li>
<li>The latter two now include buttons for the days of the week, enabling days to be toggled off or on, to indicate on which days to use the break.</li>
<li>The difference between them is that ""All Day"" doesn't have the time fields, and ""Between"" does.</li>
<li>This new feature could be useful to have breaks that are only used on weekends, or working days, or Wednesdays and Fridays, or any other combination.</li>
<li>This new option is available as a reward for current supporters. If you were a supporter in the past, but it has expired, you can extend your supporter status to use this feature, or try for an hour at a time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New option to disable the app switcher, force quit, and shut down panels during a break</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added a checkbox on the <b>Advanced</b> page to disable the panels that appear when switching apps via Cmd-Tab, force quit via Cmd-Option-Escape, and sleep, restart, or shut down via Ctrl-Eject (or Ctrl-Power). Defaults off.</li>
<li>This new option is also available as a reward for current supporters.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other changes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can now manually postpone a break for longer than the frequency interval.</li>
<li>Fixed playing a sound for the <b>Display Notification</b> break action.</li>
<li>Fixed a scheduler issue where a lower priority break may be skipped if a higher priority break has never been done.</li>
<li>Removed the Fabric crash reporter, to avoid sending unnecessary data to a third party.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Want to try it?</h4>
<p>If you are using the Mac App Store edition, you can update via the <b>App Store</b> app.</p>
<p>If you are using the direct edition, you can use the <b>Check for Updates</b> feature in the app to update.</p>

Inside the Women’s Motocross Association

Although you’re forgiven if you’ve never heard of the Women’s Motocross Association (WMA), Southern California MX fans may have seen some seriously fast ladies ripping up the incredibly rough Glen Helen track on Saturday (in between men’s Pro motos at the annual outdoors ‘Prequel’). Founded just a bit more than two years ago, the WMA appears to have already taken the role of the world’s premier sanctioning body for women’s professional motocross racing.

I had the opportunity to spend some time with a few WMA racers on the Friday morning prior to the Glen Helen race, courtesy of new series sponsor Kawasaki. Seeing these girls in action around the track at Glen Helen, besides reminding me how slow I am on an MX bike, was a revelation about the current level of Pro competition in the WMA series. Of course, none of the WMA racers are going to be out dicing with James Stewart and Ricky Carmichael, but there are some talented MX riders in this series, and the fact that a few of them are physically very small only makes it that much more entertaining to watch them throw a full-size MX bike around on a rough track.

As I said, the WMA has quickly become the premier sanctioning body in the world for women’s MX. Besides the fact that the WMA has an AMA charter (the WMA pro class champion is recognized at the AMA Sport Award Banquet), take as evidence the participation of female racers from as far away as New Zealand (it doesn’t get much farther away than that, does it?) who have come to the US to pursue their dream of success in professional MX racing.

Doesn’t sound too much different from the men’s AMA Supercross and Motocross, does it? It’s hard not to be impressed by the worldwide prestige the WMA series has attained in the short time since it was started in 2004.

Partly due to the influx of fast females from overseas, the 2006 WMA pro field is the strongest that women’s MX has ever seen. In fact, the opening race at Glen Helen on Saturday was won by one of those New Zealand imports, 17-year old phenom Katherine Prumm. In between contesting the Women’s World MX Championship in Europe (where she is in contention for the title), the Kawasaki rider has made time to come to the US for two rounds of the WMA series, hoping to earn a contract to race the series full-time next year.

In 2006, WMA races will run in conjunction with four AMA Outdoor Nationals – Hangtown, Washougal, Broome-Tioga, and Steel City. So check out the WMA web site, and if you find yourself in the pits at one of the aforementioned nationals, take the time to walk away from the long autograph lines at the factory semis and go talk to one of the WMA racers. I’m certain that the WMA series will end up with a new fan.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Join Us at “Biotech in the Belt-Tightening Era” April 9 in Seattle

Payers didn’t have much power in biotech’s old days. For a long time, biotech companies could get away with believing that if they offered patients important new drugs, devices or diagnostics they could essentially impose high prices on U.S. health insurers. Getting data to win over the FDA, physicians, and shareholders was what counted.

Those days are over. The Affordable Care Act is heading toward full implementation, and employers everywhere are screaming for an end to runaway healthcare spending. Payers are looking harder than ever to find ways to cut out waste in the system. Life science investors now increasingly want to know how the new products in the pipeline of today will thrive in the cost-constrained environment of tomorrow.

How is your biotech company adapting to the new reality? This is one of the big questions every life sciences company needs to be thinking about. So I’m excited to pull together a stellar lineup of speakers to discuss this trend at the next big Xconomy event—“Biotech in the Belt-Tightening Era.” This event will be held the afternoon of April 9 at Northeastern University’s new Seattle office at 401 Terry Avenue North.

Here’s who you can expect to hear from:

Kim Popovits, CEO of Genomic Health

—Kim Popovits, CEO of Genomic Health (NASDAQ: GHDX). This Redwood City, CA-based company has grown into one of the biggest success stories in molecular diagnostics. This company did it by blazing a trail with insurers, persuading them to pay several thousand dollars for a genetic test that can predict whether an individual woman’s breast cancer is likely to recur after surgery, and whether she is likely to benefit from a round of preventive chemotherapy. It took reams of data, and years of persistence. But the company is now building on what it learned from that experience to branch into predictive diagnostic tests for colorectal cancer and prostate cancer patients.

—Risa Stack, general manager of GE’s healthmagination program. Stack recently left her job as a go-to life sciences partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers to join GE’s $6 billion healthymagination program. The stated purpose of GE’s initiative is to foster technologies that increase access to healthcare while lowering costs. Like when she was at KPCB, she’s looking for good ideas, and figuring how they might fit into GE’s plans.

Mitch Gold

—Mitch Gold, the founder and chairman of Seattle-based Alpine Biosciences. Gold is best known as the former CEO of Dendreon. He left the company about a year ago, not too long after his company hit an iceberg known as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which conducted a lengthy public inquiry in 2011 before it decided that yes, it officially would pay $93,000 a patient for Dendreon’s sipuleucel-T (Provenge). That experience greatly influenced Gold’s thinking about his new immunotherapy venture, which has a stated goal of advancing immunotherapies that work on multiple biologic pathways, to “create a more robust, defined, and effective immune response in a more cost-efficient manner.” This will be Gold’s first public appearance discussing his plans for Alpine Biosciences, and how drug pricing considerations have factored into his strategy.

Clay Siegall

—Clay Siegall, the CEO of Seattle Genetics (NASDAQ: SGEN). Siegall’s company delivered the goods almost two years ago, introducing the first commercially successful “empowered antibody” and the biggest innovation for a couple of rare lymphomas in decades. The company responded by setting a price of $13,500 a dose initially, and increasing it since. Seattle Genetics has so far had good fortune in its dealings with insurers at this price, but I for one am interested in hearing Siegall talk about what kind of prices he believes the company will be able to command for future drugs from its pipeline.

—Scott Ramsey, director of the Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research and Evaluation at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Ramsey, was profiled in these pages last year as a “lonely voice asking tough questions on cancer cost effectiveness.” Some in industry may not like to hear what he has to say, but his voice is an influential one that shouldn’t be ignored. Results from ICORE’s studies will end up being published in peer-reviewed journals, and he intends to put data into a free public resource designed to help patients see where the waste is in cancer treatment, and help patients see where they can get bang for their healthcare buck.

—Mark Litton, co-founder and chief business officer, Alder Biopharmaceuticals. This Bothell, WA-based company was built on the idea of making better/faster/cheaper antibody drugs. Alder is now gathering the kind of data from clinical trials that it believes it will need to satisfy not just the FDA, but payers who will want to know they’re getting a good value.

—Al Luderer, CEO, Seattle-based Integrated Diagnostics. This company, a spinoff from Lee Hood’s group at the Institute for Systems Biology, is preparing to release its first commercial product this spring. It’s a blood-based test that’s supposed to be able to give doctors a clear early warning sign of lung cancer on the move. InDi will surely need to convince physicians this test is worth incorporating into their practice, but the company also started talking to payers before it even designed its all-important prospective clinical trial. I’ll be sure to ask him what he learned from those conversations, and how it influenced the company’s strategy.

Chad Robins

—Chad Robins, co-founder and CEO, Seattle-based Adaptive Biotechnologies. Robins is running one of the two aggressive startups in the U.S. using high-speed DNA sequencers to help doctors determine when they have truly wiped out a patient’s blood cancer with standard treatment, or when a previously undetectable malignancy is still hanging around there in the blood. Adaptive started out providing its service to researchers, but it is making the push into the bigger diagnostics market this year, which means it must offer a compelling proposition to payers.

As you can see, we’ve got a diverse group of speakers coming at this question on both the therapeutics and diagnostics side. I’ll have more to say about the agenda for this event in coming weeks. But now is the best time to get your tickets, as we have a President’s Day discount running for the next week. See you there at Northeastern University Seattle on April 9.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Fort Bowie Hike

Fort Bowie was established in the mid-1800s to protect Apache Pass. Apache Pass was used by the Butterfield Overland Mail Route and became an important spot to protect due to its year-round water supply, Apache Spring. For over 30 years, it was a sight of major military operations until Geronimo surrendered in 1886 and the Chiricahua Indians were removed to Florida and Alabama.

Here we are just starting our hike and we can look out towards the pass , which is where the very first V shows on the left. It was a trek of one and a half miles out and one and a half miles back, at elevations ranging from 4,550 to 5,250 feet. We began about three in the afternoon, it was upper 80s in temperature, and it didn’t take long before we were wondering if we had bit off more than we could chew, or hike, as the case may be!

The path was totally dirt and mostly smooth, although at times there was some incline and you had to really watch your step.

Here we are almost getting to the area where the Butterfield Overland Mail route went through. There was a way-station with an inn (of sorts) where the travelers could stop for the night, which now are just foundation ruins.

The fort ruins are way in the distance, just small glimmers of white. We still have a long ways to hike!

Here is one of the many varieties of cactus in the area. We are beginning to gain elevation and are very near the spring, as you can tell from the denser and greener foliage. In Arizona, you know there is water when you see large trees. Everywhere else, trees appear to be more scrub brush than what us Easterners think of as trees.

Apache Spring, the year-round water source that was the cause of so much strife in the mid- to late-1800s.

Some of the local Sonoran Desert vegetation.

And here is our goal, the ruins of Fort Bowie! After the cool shade of the springs area, this last section of the hike up was a difficult one. Thankfully there was a Visitor’s Center at the top with air conditioning, and that is where we headed and rested before venturing back out to look at the ruins. Although truthfully, by the time we got there, we had really ceased to care very much about the ruins. We were more than a little fatigued, and beginning to worry about the late hour and whether we would make it back down to the car before dark!

"Judicial Nominees

In Clinton’s 8 years in office, 61 (perhaps 63) of his judicial nominees were blocked by Senate Republicans.

In Bush’s 4 years in office, only 10 of his nominees have been blocked.

There’s no puzzle here to figure out. The facts are plain. Despite the fact that Clinton’s nominees were more centrist and Bush’s have been more extremist, The Democrats have blocked far fewer nominees than the Republicans did under Clinton. And Clinton didn’t even recycle his nominees; unlike Bush, he didn’t bring back rejects in order to make the other party look more obstructionist.

Still, right-wingers shamelessly whine about how the Democrats are uprooting Democracy by not simply out-and-out confirming whomever Bush wants put into lifetime judicial seats, no matter how radical, no matter how questionable.

When it’s shown that the GOP was far more obstructionist over Clinton, they switch arguments and say that it’s how the nominations are being blocked that’s important. The Democrats are using the filibuster, and as such, they aren’t even allowing the Congress to vote on the nominees! How evil!

But then, under Clinton, Republicans (who had control over both houses of Congress and therefore did not need the filibuster) blocked most of Clinton’s nominees under what was called the “blue slip” system. In this system, a nominee’s home-state senator may indefinitely delay and thereby kill a nomination simply by withholding a blue slip of paper needed by the Judiciary committee for the nomination to go forward. In other words, Republicans didn’t even allow the Congress to vote on the nominees!

Both filibusters and the blue slip achieve the same end by the same method: delay a nomination until the Senate gives up and moves on. So any claim by Republicans that the filibuster is somehow dirty is hypocritical to say the least.

After Bush took office, the blue slip rule was still in effect–but then Republicans started noticing that Democrats were using it for the same purposes Republicans had! Well, we can’t have that! So in 2003, when Republicans retook their sliver majority in the Senate, they changed the rules (they love doing that, don’t they?) so Democrats couldn’t do what they had been doing. This forced the Democrats to either resort to filibusters, or to become completely powerless. All of this just adds another layer to the GOP hypocrisy.

Another layer still: it turns out that Senate Republicans haveused the filibuster to block nominations themselves. In 1995, Clinton nominated Dr. Henry Foster Jr. for a Public Health post. Senators Orrin Hatch, Trent Lott, John Ashcroft, Bob Dole, John McCain and 38 other Republicans successfully filibustered the Senate to shoot down Clinton’s nominee. When Clinton nominated the same man as Surgeon General in 1998, Ashcroft again used the filibuster, though this time unsuccessfully. The GOP similarly used the filibuster to block ambassadorial and judicial nominees as well.

So just about every way you can look at it, the Senate Republicans are being massively hypocritical on this issue. They blocked more nominees, and in as many as if not more ways than Democrats. It’s the hit-and-run driver berating the jaywalker for his scofflaw behavior.

But rank-and-file Republicans don’t seem to care about this. It’s outrage time, apparently. However, I don’t see this becoming as big an issue in next year’s elections as such things as, say, the deficit, social security, and right to privacy vs. political grandstanding (re: Terry Schiavo). I think there are enough stains on the GOP record so that the voters won’t as easily forget. And blaming others is how the GOP thrives. Republicans have controlled Congress completely for 10 of the 12 years up to 2006 (the other 2 years mostly in complete control) and will have had the White House for 6. When things are going down the toilet, they won’t have anyone to blame but themselves; no one will be buying the idea that everything is still Clinton’s fault.

It cuts both ways. Here is an exerpt from a MSNBC article.
There are very few who are not hypocritical on this, even the dear democrats. (Since it seems you were not aware.)

“Protesting the maneuvers by Republican senators, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told the Senate on March 9, 2000, “Whoever the next president might be, if it is a Republican president, do we start doing the same things to him the Republicans have done to President Clinton?”

We now know the answer to Leahy’s question: yes.

Leahy and other Democrats are doing to President Bush what the Republicans did to Clinton. Such delays “should not be done in judicial nominations,” Leahy said in 2000. “We should protect the integrity and the independence of our federal courts.”

Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., on March 8, 2000 noted “It is indefensible to hold a nomination hostage for his entire second term. It defies the clear constitutional prerogatives of the duly elected president to choose nominees to the bench and the duty of the Senate to say yes or no.”

“I plead with my colleagues to move judges with alacrity, vote them up or down,” said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. during the Paez saga. “This delay makes a mockery of the Constitution.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Daily Archives: October 15, 2008

My column for the FT this week (mentioned here two posts ago) states my own view on the implications of the financial crisis for the future of capitalism–namely, that the effects outside finance will be limited, and this is not the end of capitalism as we know it. Here are two other interesting and forcefully expressed opinions.

Harold Meyerson in the Washington Post thinks the game is up for “unregulated capitalism”:

In 1949, a number of famous writers, among them Arthur Koestler, André Gide, Richard Wright, Stephen Spender and Ignazio Silone, wrote essays explaining why they were no longer communists. The essays were collected in a volume entitled “The God That Failed.”

Today, conservative intellectuals might want to consider writing a tome on the failure of their own beloved deity, unregulated capitalism. The fall of the financial system has been so fast and far-reaching that there’s been no time to fully consider its implications for the reigning economic theology of the past 30 years. But with the most right-wing administration in modern American history scurrying to nationalize the banks, the question cannot be elided indefinitely.

What exactly do economic conservatives believe now that their god is dead? What’s become of the glories of privatized Social Security? Of the merits of 401(k)s vs. defined-benefit pensions?

No wonder we’ve seen a disoriented John McCain wandering the moors howling about Bill Ayers. What’s he supposed to do? Admit that the Reagan-Thatcher faith in unregulated capitalism, to which every GOP presidential candidate was pledging allegiance just last winter, has collapsed?

Interesting to see this dismiss the Clinton and Blair administrations as mere extensions of the Reagan-Thatcher order. Actually I agree with Meyerson about that: they were. But I thought that the Democratic narrative upholds the 1990s as an example of how good things can be when intelligent, well-meaning people are in charge. In other words, good government is more a question of competence and good faith than ideology. To abandon that line, you have to consign Clinton and Blair to the trash.

I was also a bit puzzled by this:

McCain and Barack Obama disagree sharply on the government’s role in bolstering the economy. Obama favors public outlays on alternative energy and education, which would not only create jobs but also make us more competitive globally.

What is this, “make us more competitive globally”? Surely that is the old, dead paradigm. Even as the piece reads its last rites, that Reagan-Thatcher way of thinking is stirring back to life. If you are going to dispense with market forces, I don’t think you can afford to care very much about staying competitive globally.

The other piece, much more to my own way of thinking, is by Simon Jenkins. For many years (outside the specialist domain of economic commentary) he has been my favourite British pundit, and one of the two or three best I have come across anywhere. Rigorous, liberal (in the old-fashioned sense), open-minded and surprising. See what you think:

So this is to be Brown’s Falklands. Victory on Mount All-fall-down. Bonfire of the bonuses. Service in St Paul’s. March-past by the Royal Troop of Derivatives Traders. Anthem to the Bankers’ Brigade. Tomb of the Unknown Arbitrageur.

A fortnight is clearly a long time in ideology. What fun historians will have with October 2008. Do you remember the hoary old days when they let Lehmans go bankrupt and refused to guarantee bank deposits? Where were you when a governor of the Bank of England worried about inflation and something called moral hazard? How tables turn. Socialism is now cock of the walk, capitalism mugged by reality.

It is rubbish, total rubbish. Market failure has been compounded by brain failure of the discredited profession of economics, overwhelmed by journalistic wish-fulfilment and glee.

The banks have not been “nationalised”, just deluged with money. They remain pluralist and competitive institutions, with independent boards. Their workers are not civil servants. Investors retain their shares. The bonus culture will revive. The impresarios of greed have been punished, or at least a few of them. But this is not socialism in our time, just public money hurled at the face of capitalism.

Rabies

Rabies is a disease caused by a virus that can affect the nervous
system (brain and spinal cord) of any kind of mammal, including humans.
Rabies-infected animals can spread the disease through their saliva or brain
matter.

Signs of rabies in animals may include excessive saliva or
sometimes foaming at the mouth, paralysis, or behavioral changes in a pet
(shyness when the pet used to be friendly) or no fear of humans in a wild
animal.

After rabies symptoms appear, the disease progresses quickly and
is very difficult to cure. Getting postexposure prophylaxis shots (PEP) before symptoms
occur usually gets rid of the virus before it can cause serious damage. Rabies
is nearly always fatal if not treated before symptoms appear.

People who believe they may have been exposed to the rabies virus
should seek medical attention immediately.

"FDA Approves Eloctate for Patients with Hemophilia A

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Eloctate, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc fusion protein, for use in adults and children who have Hemophilia A. Eloctate is the first Hemophilia A treatment designed to require less frequent injections when used to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding.

Eloctate is approved to help control and prevent bleeding episodes, manage bleeding during surgical procedures, and prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes (prophylaxis). Eloctate consists of the Coagulation Factor VIII molecule (historically known as Antihemophilic Factor) linked to a protein fragment, Fc, which is found in antibodies. This makes the product last longer in the patient's blood.

“The approval of this product provides an additional therapeutic option for use in the care of patients with Hemophilia A,"" said Karen Midthun, M.D., director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.

Hemophilia A is an inherited, sex-linked, blood clotting disorder, which primarily affects males, and is caused by defects in the Factor VIII gene. Hemophilia A affects 1 in every 5,000 males born in the United States. People with Hemophilia A can experience repeated episodes of serious bleeding, mainly into the joints, which can be severely damaged by the bleeding.

The safety and efficacy of Eloctate were evaluated in a clinical trial of 164 patients that compared the prophylactic treatment regimen to on-demand therapy. The trial demonstrated that Eloctate was effective in the treatment of bleeding episodes, in preventing or reducing bleeding and in the control of bleeding during and after surgical procedures. No safety concerns were identified in the trial.

Eloctate received orphan-drug designation for this use by the FDA because it is intended for treatment of a rare disease or condition.

Eloctate is manufactured by Biogen Idec, Inc., Cambridge, Mass.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The Mayor walked through the three possible routes and numerous possible future extensions. He broke down how successful systems in cities such as Seattle, Portland, and Tacoma have started with routes similar in length to the proposed for the Milwaukee Streetcar system (2 to 3 miles).

The public is invited to attend an open house to review and comment on the proposed routes on October 8th, 2009 from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Zeidler Municipal Building at 841 N. Broadway.

Keep in mind that this is a starter system, limited by the availability of funds. The plan is that once something is in the ground, expansions will be a lot easier. Mayor Barrett himself describes the plan as a “trojan horse” designed to be expanded.

We invite you to vote in the below poll for your favorite route (and leave a message in the comments why), here is some quick food for thought from us. You’re also invited to buy a streetcar t-shirt, and wear it to the event on October 8th to show your support.

Alignment #1

This route seems positioned for success because it connects likely riders (urban residents) with jobs. The Third Ward and downtown are filled with “creative class” jobs, and downtown and the lower East Side are filled with “creative class” workers. Likewise this streetcar would connect service industry workers with numerous restaurants, bars, and retail locations, saving money for the people who need it most.

The jog up to Brady is more valuable than the jog further south in the Third Ward. Adding access for thousands of residents by connecting to Brady is more desirable than getting to the front door of more jobs in the Third Ward. It seems likely that if riders were dropped off by the iconic Milwaukee Public Market they would likely walk to the jobs located south of St. Paul in the Third Ward.

Development potential along this route is good, although secondary to the potential for riders. This is key in this author’s viewpoint for making the starter system successful.

Connection to the Intermodal Station is essential for regional transit (Amtrak, KRM, Megabus, Greyhound, etc).

The 4th Street jaunt at the west end of the route seems likely to be underutilized, with likely only convention attendees and a few hotel guests using the leg. It might be better waiting until funds are available to make the 4th Street leg go further north.

Alignment #2

The Water Street leg seems to pass less housing than Alignment #1 would. On the flip side it would likely pass more jobs, and more bars. It seems that a better balance would yield better ridership for the starter system.

The potential Brady Street leg is intriguing, but likely a disappointment in terms of development. The Water Street portion could see more accelerated development, because of the line’s construction (The North End’s development would likely be accelerated). The Brady Street portion would draw riders, however, future growth may be difficult because of neighborhood politics including the East Village Neighborhood Conversation Overlay District that limit heights and thereby inhibits density beyond a certain level. Additionally, Brady Street itself is a historic district, which could limit the possibility of new development as well. Long-term development potential from the line on Brady Street is likely fairly limited (compared to other potential routes).

The 4th Street jaunt at the west end of the route seems likely to be underutilized, with likely only convention attendees and a few hotel guests using the leg. It might be better waiting until funds are available to make the 4th Street leg go further north.

The alignment is less connected with the Third Ward, a large center of jobs, and is even further disconnected with the growing number of apartments at the east and southern areas of the Third Ward.

Alignment #3

The alignment misses a large portion of East Town, the most jobs-dense portion of the city.

The alignment serves many major entertainment hubs (Bradley Center, US Cellular Arena, Milwaukee Theater, Turner Hall Ballroom, Midwest Airlines Convention Center), which are likely to generate high ridership, but only on a handful of days.

The alignment misses the Third Ward completely, a large jobs center, and an increasingly dense population center.

The potential Brady Street leg is intriguing, but likely a disappointment in terms of development. The Water Street portion could see more accelerated development because of the line’s construction (The North End’s development would likely be accelerated). The Brady Street portion would draw riders, however, future growth may be difficult because of neighborhood politics including the East Village Neighborhood Conversation Overlay District that limit heights and thereby inhibit density beyond a certain level. Additionally, Brady Street itself is a historic district, which could limit the possibility of new development as well. Long-term development potential from the line on Brady Street is likely fairly limited (compared to other potential routes).

The leg from Ogden to Brady would be important to generate ridership on the route, but it’s hard to imagine many people riding it to work daily.

The route has the greatest development potential of the three routes, with all of the Park East covered. Unfortunately, that comes with the trade-off of likely the lowest ridership.

If the goal is to build a starter system with the greatest number of riders possible, this is the worst option.

33 thoughts on “Milwaukee Streetcar Routes Unveiled by Mayor Barrett”

Seems that the first option would have the highest projected ridership? Gotta go with whatever fetches the highest ridership with the starter system, the purpose of transit is for people to ride it, and that should help with extensions when the time comes.

I’d say option 2 would be the best since it is most centrally located in the downtown to serve both east town and west town. Though I read that the streetcar may not have it’s own dedicated lane or have street lights turn green automatically for the streetcar? If that is true then don’t even bother with the system, it’s going to be no different than the bus in that it will get caught in traffic, like a bus, travel and a low average speed, and not run on a set schedule.

#1 looks best. Connects intermodal station with U.S. Bank Center (this is critical, it’s the largest office building in the state), NW Mutual HQ, Fed courthouse, Cathedral Square, Third Ward, MSOE, Metromarket, Mil. Public Market, close to 411 E. Wisconsin and Pfister, and connects all of that with densely populated east side.

I agree with Nathaniel, If people don’t ride and the system is not immediately successful, it will be crucified by the likes of Talk Radio. A streetcar system has been blocked for years, so it needs to hit the ground running if it comes about. The public must get behind it or it will be shelved for another 15 years.

I like #1 for the simple fact that it goes through the central business district, while incorporating some entertainment venues.

An even better route would start at the intermodal station, go north on 4th to Wisconsin Avenue, then east along Wisconsin Avenue to Jackson/Van Buren, then north to Ogden, then east to Farwell. Why not run this thing on Wisconsin Avenue, which is downtown’s main street?

I think option 1 with the extension would be great, and I would actually trade the extension for the small segment that goes from the station to Wisconsin since that segment will be very underutilized.

@Andrew, I think there is a lot of consternation with the BRT folks from the county about having both lines on the same street (which to me seems ridiculous, but it is what it is). Might be a congestion/speed of service issue with Wisconsin too (not sure).

Hopefully #1 is what is built, with the extension to Brady. This brings together a nice mix of tourist destinations, jobs, housing, and nightlife. Hopefully if KRM and the county’s BRT plans move forward there will be easy transfers(no extra fees/thoughtful placement).

Great news. At a glance, I prefer route number 1, though I agree that the 4th street leg seems unnecessary. You’d be quicker walking the 0.30 miles from the intermodal station to the convention center than waiting for a streetcar.

Also, this route passes under 794 via Van Buren and Jackson. It seems this routing would severely limit the potential for tidying up the knot of highway ramps at this location or implementing a surface level boulevard. Perhaps a crossing closer the river would be better in this regard? Is the trade-off worth it?

I see many of your arguements for route 1, but remember that we also have a proposed COMET system that would, if built, run norh on Prospect and south on Farewell with stops along that corridor. So, do we want duplication? You need to look at the systems together. Or is this proposal replacing the COMET…I thought it was the new route for the downtown circular streetcar

OK, after further review route 1 looks the best option considering the current land use, but 2 could lead to new development along the water street corridor and park east. I am torn….to with what will work now or what could create more growth in a under utilized area of the downtown.

regardless of where the route is they MUST have a dedicated lane for the vehicle and they must have the street lights turn green for the vehicle so that it’s movement is not stoped for traffic lights. This mode needs to be significantly quicker than the existing buses and in needs to be on time at stops or it won’t be used.

I think option 1 hits the greatest number of commuters and would provide walkable access to all the entertainment destinations available downtown.

One question that will hopefully be answered at the meeting is how many cars will run on this line?

Personally, I would hope there will be no schedule, instead you can expact that a train will be along every 5-10 mins. Unfortunately, given the length of this starter system, if it has a schedule like our current buses it would probably still be easier to make the 30 min walk downtown rather than wait 30 min for a ride.

I voted for #1 as the best of the lot but I think that the first route should definitely include going all the way to UWM period. Otherwise I don’t think it will be successful as it could be. I know that it would take more $ but then an unsuccessful route is wasting what we have and puts a pall on further development.

For maximum economic development as well as school/job ridership I would include route north of Brady that would include Downer and Oakland shopping centers, that mirrors the “30” and “15” routes that are the most successful of the present bus routes.

This would be the “Dream Route” for a successful first run of the street cars in Milwaukee.

I think option #1 is the best of the three but it really needs to run at least North Ave. I really can’t imagine that the streetcar is going to blaze though the short route in a way that will far surpass the bus system. I live a few blocks of North and the 30 only takes 20/25 min for me to get to work (4th & Wis) and the 15 about 5 min less. I know people who live along the proposed route that drive and I really don’t forsee then giving up cars for this. Its the people on the fringes of downtown (less economically well off) who really need quick and fast transit versus people who live in 400k condos or pay 2k a month in rent. I know we have to start somewhere, but I think the starting point needs to be a bit larger.

If the line could be extended at least to North Ave, that would capture a large number of UWM students, especially since UWM is running those shuttles between the Kenwood campus and North Ave. Yes, it would require a transfer to get downtown where the 15 and 30 wouldn’t, but unlike the 30 or 15, it would allow you to get to the Intermodal station with luggage. Better would be all the way to UWM.

I think what hasn’t been made clear here is that there is only enough money for about 2 miles. Of course it would be great to get to North Avenue or UWM. It would also be great to get to Marquette, Bay View, Bronzeville and many other locations but there is only enough money for 2 miles.

I lived on the Eastside (Prospect and Brady area) for many years, in the Third Ward for a year, attended UWM for undergrad and grad school, worked downtown for two years and honestly, I don’t think I would have ever ridden the proposed streetcar.

I owned a car but often tried to survive without it by using the 15/30 buses. My thought is that “Milwaukee Urbanites” will adapt to this system if it perhaps connects UWM to Marquette and runs through the Third Ward / Downtown / East Town / Brady / North / probably a few other locations… otherwise the bus seems more convenient.

Maybe we’re “building a bridge halfway over the river” because that’s all the money we have? (I know not the best analogy) and I could be totally wrong about this… maybe there are enough people who regularly need to go between East Town and Downtown for this too work.

I think Urban Milwaukee staff should create a different poll, such as: if you are a “Milwaukee Urbanite” would you use the streetcar? Y / N

Also, I’m wondering if any transportation engineering types have weighed in on this.

And one more thing… thank you Urban Milwaukee. Someday I plan to move back to Milwaukee but I feel like I’m not missing anything because of your site.

Michael, one of the benefits of a streetcar is that it won’t just attract us urbanites, it will attract almost everyone. There are a lot of people who live on the lower east side who now drive to the Third Ward or downtown. I know that sounds crazy, but it’s true. The bus is not appealing to them for a number of reasons (confusing, infrequency of service, misconceptions, etc.). The beauty of enhanced transit options like a streetcar is that they can help increase transit ridership as a whole, because they appeal to a larger group of potential users.

From a transportation engineering standpoint: Granted, never underestimate an American’s willingness to shell out $$ to be moved 4 blocks without walking, but still, this leg doesn’t seem to make much sense.

From a political/marketing standpoint: There’s zero chance this thing gets build WITHOUT being paraded around in front of the convention center. And there’s the end of discussion for that leg!

In addition to the convention center, it might be important for the streetcar to make an appearance on Downtown’s main drag west of the river.

Something else I have been wondering about…I’m assuming the streetcar line and the vehicles themselves will need some sort of maintenance shed. Looking at alternative 1, it seems to me that one of the best places for this building to go would be in the 4th and Clybourn Area. I assumed that was another reason why that particular little jaunt. Any other ideas where it could go?

I have to go with the consensus on #1. Simply because of projected ridership and the fact that #3 just leads to sports arenas and a empty and unused mall and #2 seems to follow only nightlife not linking any of the East town residences to third ward and downtown

Have you guys (Dave and Jeramey) heard anything more about a locally preferred alternative? I know that milwaukeeconnector.com gave a timetable with a “locally preferred alternative approved” in December 2009 to January 2010. Would the City Common Council be in charge of choosing this alternative? The City engineering department?",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Exclusive: Peugeot board approves outline Dongfeng deal - source

Sophie Sassard

3 Min Read

LONDON (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen’s (PEUP.PA) board has approved a plan for an alliance with Dongfeng (0489.HK) in which the Chinese carmaker and the French state would buy large minority stakes at a 40 percent discount to Peugeot’s current share price, a source familiar with the matter said.

Peugeot employees work on the assembly line at the Dongfeng PSA Peugeot Citroen factory in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei province, November 17, 2006. CHINA OUT REUTERS/Stringer

The board agreed to enter final negotiations on a 3.5 billion euro ($4.8 billion) share issue that would see France and Dongfeng Motor Group take matching 20 percent holdings, the source said on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The capital increase would be priced at below 7 euros per share, and perhaps as low as a 6.85 euro indicative offer from Dongfeng, the source said. Peugeot’s shares closed at 11.50 euros on Wednesday.

A spokesman for Peugeot declined to comment on the alliance talks. Dongfeng officials could not be reached after hours in Wuhan, China. The French government also declined to comment.

Peugeot, one of the carmakers worst hit by the European market slump, is cutting jobs and plant capacity to try to halt losses within two years.

Philippe Varin, Peugeot’s outgoing chief executive, has said the French carmaker is exploring a deeper relationship with Dongfeng, its existing partner in a Chinese joint venture.

The two companies have been in talks for months to extend cooperation to other Asian countries after a multibillion-euro share issue in which Dongfeng and the French government would acquire significant stakes, sources have said.

The Financial Times reported they plan to transfer some Peugeot technologies to Dongfeng while targeting new markets in southeast Asia.

The hefty discount on the proposed deal, approved by Peugeot’s board on Tuesday, reflects worsening conditions and currency headwinds since the company pledged to halve its cash burn to 1.5 billion euros this year, the source said.

Under its outline terms, Dongfeng and the French state would each hold about 20 percent of Peugeot after a reserved share sale to the French state and Dongfeng and accompanying rights issue for existing shareholders.

The founding Peugeot family would lose control as its stake was diluted from 25 percent to 15 percent even after acquiring some new stock in the rights issue, the source said.

The effect would be even more dilutive for 7 percent-shareholder General Motors (GM.N) or any other existing investors that turn down the chance to buy new shares. Peugeot hopes to conclude the deal in January or February, according to the source.

In a move that may help secure the new funding from Dongfeng, Peugeot last week named former Renault No.2 Carlos Tavares as its next chief executive.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"In my last post, I was delighted to see the TGISVPAlpha & Beta Portfolios continue to expand their level of out-performance vs. their ISEQ benchmark. Particularly pleasing was the sight of my favourite, the Smart Alpha portfolio, far outpacing the others with a 21.1%YTD absolute return. But we’re still only 9 months into the experiment, so clearly we need a far longer horizon to confirm if this performance edgeis sustainable.

It also makes me wonder if there’s a lesson to be learned here..? No, not whether value investingout-performs in the long run – I’m fully convinced of that already! [And if you’re not, please please read some of the numerous papers published on the topic]. But whether a mechanicalapproach is perhaps better?

Ha! No, I’m certainly not planning on becoming a stock screening convert..! But I wonder: Even if you’re a v competent & disciplined value analyst, even if you’ve conquered much of the fear & greed involved in investing, perhaps that demon mind still trips you up at that v last hurdle, or two..? When you’ve a nice stack of portfolio candidates lined up, why do you then take a shine to some & not to others? Why does one special stock really get your heart racing, far out of proportion to its obvious prospects? Why do you end up triple invested in one stock vs. another, when they both lined up pretty much even-stevens in terms of risk/reward?

Yes, even when you have a v disciplined & analytical framework for your investing, there’s still a lot of mystery attached to the end-result: The actual composition of your portfolio. Does that mystery add, or subtract, value?Perhaps a more mechanical portfolio approach, such as the TGISVP Beta (or even Alpha) portfolios, actually adds more value? Perhaps it may even be the logical & ultimate extension to a value investing approach? I really don’t have the answer. Thoughts..?!

Anyway, now we’ve got TGISVP performance up-to-date, I thought it would be interesting (and even useful!) for readers to see the latest snapshot of potentialIrish Winner & Loserstocks. For this, I’m using a slightly different version of my TGISVP performance file:

– All share prices are as ofSep-30th

– The vast majority of target valuations are unchanged** from Q1 – I haven’t seen fit to change them, even for stocks I hold

– All FX rates are updated, so this will affect the actual target prices for a significant percentage of stocks

As you can see, this mostly boils down to an exercise in ranking stocks based on comparing current share prices vs. my original target valuations. Therefore, it’s only right to warn you to perform your own research & analytical update if any stock(s) happen to catch your eye. Subsequent news flow & results can, on occasion, radically (& abruptly) change the intrinsic value of a company – which is unlikely to be factored into a valuation that dates back to, for example, February.

So…why don’t I just update all valuations once a quarter, or so?!Erm, right – because i) I just don’t have the time, we’re talking 70+stocks here, and ii) I really don’t need to – this is a screening/ranking exercise, after all! Broadly speaking, most intrinsic valuations should & do evolve slowly over time. Therefore, once the heavy lifting of the initial valuation phase is done, we then have a framework to quickly & easily keep track of a large number of companies, and the most likely under/over-valued stocks. Even with no input/updates to intrinsic valuation, I think it’s reasonable to expect this exercise to be still making a valuable contribution up to 12-18 months later. Of course, if you’re actually contemplating a fresh purchase (or sale) of one of these stocks, that would obviously demand a deeper dive first.

But maybe you disagree with my assertion that most intrinsic valuations only evolve slowly? In your opinion, or experience, perhaps they change much more frequently & violently..?If so, can I make a suggestion (gained from my own long & bitter experience) – take a long, hard look in the mirror, it might be you:

i) Do you regularly change intrinsic valuations, sometimes radically, based on exactly the same facts & figures, or on a v incremental change in results or news flow?

ii) Do you own too many stocks that actually experience radical changes in their share price and intrinsic valuation, often overnight?

If i) is proving a problem, it’s possible you’re being somewhat inconsistent, and/or less than rigorous, in your valuation analyses. You may also be allowing greed & fear to influence you too much. Developing an overall (reasonably rigid) analytical framework & a related set of metrics, and constantly challenging yourself to value large & varied lists of stocks, is a great path to better analytical rigour, and less emotion.

If ii) is hurting, you may be picking too many risky and/or difficult stocks. They’re likely to have poor management/governance, a bad/volatile business model, and/or they’re simply over-leveraged (and/or cash-flow negative). Or maybe they’re just outright gambles (‘oh God, if they hit oil…we’re all rich – if they don’t…ah, just shut the fuck up!’). These are exactly the kind of stocks which love to surprise you in the worst way possible… Yeah, sure, difficult stocks might present an intriguing challenge, and pure gambles are so enticing – but really, why bloody bother?

You’ve absolutely nothing to prove, to anybody, in your investing! Big talk, and all those usual coulda/woulda/shouldas, just means sweet f***-all… ‘Cos all that matters, in the end, is your actual (long-term) portfolio return. And that matters to you, and nobody else – they don’t get rich if you do, and they definitely don’t care if you lose it all! And I can assure you there’s always far easier & safer stocks to invest in, offering just as much upside potential. OK, perhaps you might have to look a little harder… And sleep a little easier… ;-)

And so, let’s begin with the current Bottom 15 in TGISVP:

Good God..! Just look at this lot – pretty much a bunch of tawdry junior resource stocks. I imagine buying these would feel like signing up for a daily kick in the bollocks… Any day your tender gonads were miraculously left unmolested would feel like a winner, eh? I’m not suggesting you short any of these losers (if that’s even possible?), but if you own (or are actively buying) any of them, I’d recommend you think v long & hardabout the risks involved. I certainly wouldn’t want to own them…

And you could definitely have your money in something better, anyway – what..? Yeah, sure, maybe even lottery tickets..! But failing that, you might even think about truffle hunting in this patch instead – the TGISVP Top 15:

Of course, this isn’t an invitation to dive wholesale into these stocks either! While I think the target prices fairly balance the risks/rewards involved, some of these stocks present corporate governance risks/issues. Or they’re simply over-leveraged, which tends to lead to a v binary outcome ultimately (success, and the stock price doubles/triples, or failure, and you get wiped out). Personally I’m happy to see three out of my four Irish holdings on the list, and pretty content with them also! Write-ups here: FBD/Total Produce, and Petroneft.

I’m also happy to see my next(well, potentially!) Irish stock lurking on the list. ;-) But I’d probably want to sell/lighten up an existing Irish holding before buying it. That could prove a blessing, I’ve a feeling it might come a little cheaper first…

Finally, my other Irish stock, Trinity Biotech (TRIB:US), actually missed the cut. Not exactly a source of complaint though – it’s due to the continued rally in the TRIB share price. In fact, a recent Barron’s article gave it the oomph this week to blow past my latest intrinsic value target of $13.41, and close up +11% this week at $13.99. However, rather unusually, I also specified a secondary price target of $16.69 which still beckons. This was actually surpassed by an $18.50 price target cited by Barron’s, which may prove tempting to many US investors now that TRIB’s finally back on their radar with a good growth story & stock performance.

Good luck!

And just email me if you want to discuss/compare notes on any of the above stocks, or the implications of any news flow, or results, since my original valuation target. I’m also attaching the relevant Excel file that supports the above tables, for your reference – feel free, of course, to refresh share prices and to revise/completely alter valuations as you see fit for your own analysis.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Eagles selling Chip Kelly on Michael Vick, Nick Foles

It's long been assumed that Michael Vick and the Philadelphia Eagles are set to part ways this offseason, but the potential hiring of Oregon coach Chip Kelly might alter the quarterback's fate.

NFL.com's Ian Rapoport reported Sunday the Eagles are selling Kelly on two major factors: First, a roster already stocked with the type of players Kelly recruited at Oregon, including a handful of short, fast wideouts. Second, a pair of in-house signal-callers that loom as a decent fit to operate Kelly's up-tempo, spread attack.

Nick Foles and Vick would, indeed, give Kelly a pair of unique quarterbacks to work with. Foles is raw, but promising. Vick's best days have passed, but he's an intriguing fit for Kelly's option scheme and, on paper, a better proposition than Brandon Weeden and Colt McCoy of the Cleveland Browns, the second team competing furiously with the Eagles to hire the innovative coach.

Without question, something the Eagles said Saturday clicked with Kelly. Their lunchtime meeting dragged on well into the night and hit the brakes on assumptions the Browns and Kelly are a sure thing.

If Philadelphia winds up with the top prize in this coaching derby, Vick's presence -- on a team that seemed ready to wave goodbye just days ago -- might wind up serving as a difference-maker.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Kaseya VSA R9.1 AuthAnvil Module - Release Notes

With the release of Kaseya VSA R9.1 new capabilities have been added. Please see this article for the rest of the R9.1 release notes.

Kaseya introduces a new addon module with this release, integrating AuthAnvils identity and access management (IAM) solution with the Kaseya VSA. Integration with the VSA comprises three different AuthAnvil services.

Live Connect sessions, set independently from other types of remote control sessions

Alerts and logging are provided for all two factor authentication activity. Active Directory integration is supported. You can optionally enable endpoints with a ""queue"" of passcodes to support authentication when endpoints cannot connect to a network, for example laptops out in the field.

Password Server

The same AuthAnvil module includes integration with Password Server. Password Server is used to configure and store all the credentials VSA administrators are required to work with, on behalf of multiple customers. Password Server includes the ability to set policies for credentials, control user access to each credential using personal, private and shared vaults, schedule password updates, and maintain logs of credentials usage. Password Server supports both SAML-enabled logons that allow immediate access and logons that require a business workflow to complete the logon. Password Server can optionally include the two factor authentication credentials youve created using the Two Factor Authentication service.

Single Sign On

A credential, with or without two factor authentication, can be added as a ""menu app"" item to the Single Sign On service. Once the Single Sign On menu is configured, the VSA user only needs to authenticate oncetypically using two factor authenticationto gain access to this menu. Clicking any app in the menu provides instant access to any other resource without having to re-authenticate. The three services, integrated with the VSA, handle all authentications entirely behind the scenes, providing immediate, highly- secure access to all the machines you manage.

One of the applications you can add to each VSA user's Single Sign On menu is an app to logon to the VSA. This means the Single Single On menu provides immediate, secure access to the VSA as well as all other resources VSA users require to perform their daily tasks.

Agent Procedure Approvals using Two Factor Authentication

Instead of signing and then approving agent procedures using two different VSA users, you can now sign and approve agent procedures using your 2FA passcode, if Two Factor Authentication has been enabled for your VSA user.

VSA Logon Page

The style of the VSA logon page has been updated to emphasize the VSA's new identity and password management capabilities. It also adapts when resizing the window.

Installation

The AuthAnvil integration addon module for VSA is installed by default at no charge when you upgrade to R91. AuthAnvil is purchased separately. All three AuthAnvil services must be installed on a separate system from the KServer. Usually all three services are installed on the same system, along with the database server used by the AuthAnvil services.

If you are not an existing AuthAnvil customer please contact sales@scorpionsoft.com for more information about purchasing AuthAnvil.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Judge criticised for 'immigrants exploiting benefits' comment

A Crown Court judge has been disciplined for saying that hundreds of thousands of immigrants come to Britain to get benefits.

Judge Ian Trigger was given an official rebuke over remarks about the UK's 'completely lax immigration policy', which he made when jailing an illegal immigrant drug dealer for two years.

It was one of the last decisions by Labour former justice secretary Jack Straw, who until last week policed judicial behaviour with the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge.

Criticised: Judge Ian Trigger, left, was today 'advised' over comments he made about immigration while sentencing a Jamaican drug dealer last year

They said Judge Trigger made 'an inappropriate judicial intervention
in the political process'. His criticism of immigration policy was
'wholly unrelated' to the case of the Jamaican drug dealer he was
sentencing last July.

Lucien McClearley came to Britain as a tourist in 2001 and claimed asylum when his visa ran out.

The defendant was arrested in October 2002 when the visa ran out but he
claimed asylum and was released while it was being processed.

This claim was rejected in 2004, but he stayed in Britain without
any interference from the authorities until February 2009, when police
stopped a car he was driving and smelt cannabis.

McClearley admitted taking a vehicle without consent, possessing
cannabis and cocaine, possessing a class B drug with intent and two
counts of possessing false identity documents.

McClearley, who was 31 at the time, was jailed for two years on July 28, 2009.

Sentencing him at the time at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge Trigger said: ‘Your case illustrates all too clearly the completely lax immigration policy that exists and has existed over recent years.

‘People like you, and there are literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people like you, come to these shores to avail themselves of the generous welfare benefits that exist here.

‘In the past 10 years the national debt of this country has risen to extraordinary heights, largely because central government has wasted billions of pounds. Much of that has been wasted on welfare payments.

‘For every £1 that the decent citizen, who is hard-working, pays in taxes, nearly 10 per cent goes on servicing that national debt.

‘That is twice the amount it was in 1997 when this Government came to power.’

The controversial comments sparked an investigation which resulted in today's criticism.

Judge Trigger has 'received formal advice' from Lord Judge, in effect a slap on the wrist.

A spokesman for the judiciary said: ‘His Honour Judge Trigger has received formal advice from the Lord Chief Justice following an investigation into comments he made in open court during the sentencing of Lucien McClearley.

‘The investigation found, and the Lord Chief Justice agreed, that Judge Trigger's comments were wholly unrelated to any of the issues which arose for consideration in his sentencing decision, and represented an inappropriate judicial intervention in the political process.’",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Biographical Summary:

Living his youth in a place called Nauvoo, Illinois, the saints had built a city which at the time was bigger than the city of Chicago. They had also built a temple which was the largest and most expensive building west of Philadelphia. From here they were driven by their enemies to a resting place called Council Bluffs, Iowa. Here, Henry enlisted in the Mormon Battalion, an army of 500 men called to fight in the war with Mexico and help secure California for the U.S. as part of Manifest Destiny. It was and still is, the longest infantry march in U.S. Military history. There is hardly an event that occurred in the American west between 1846 to 1848 that some of the members of this group did not take part in. Henry was probably the second Packard in California.

Henry Packard was born May 6, 1825, in Parkman, Geauga, Ohio, the third child of Noah Packard and Sophia Bundy. His parents were some of the early settlers in that town, and when he was seven his family were converts to the Mormon Church.

In 1840 the family moved to Nauvoo, Hancock, Illinois, which one year before was nothing more that a marshy bend in the Mississippi River called Commerce, which contained a few log cabins. Their new home being located across the street from the city's founder, mayor and spiritual leader, Joseph Smith. Passers-by were amazed at what the saints had built in such a short time, which shocked their enemies as well. A year and a half after the murder of Joseph Smith, they were driven from the state as both the federal and state governments stood idly by and watched it happen.

Henry's father was too ill and too poor to leave Nauvoo that February of 1846 and cross the frozen Mississippi River with Brigham Young, but he at least sent his three oldest sons to help the saints move to their new home in the West. They traveled as far west as Winter Quarters, Nebraska.

At Mt. Pisgah (Grand River), Iowa, the saints were met by Captain James Allen, under the command of Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, commander of the U.S. Army of the West stationed at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He brought orders authorizing him to enlist 500 volunteers for a year, in a campaign to secure California in the war with Mexico. On July 20, 1846, the battalion started their march from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to Fort Leavenworth. At this time Captain Allen was promoted to Colonel and Kearny was promoted to General.

When the battalion reached Fort Leavenworth August 1st, there were 22 officers and 474 enlisted men for a total of 496. There were also 34 women and a number of children. 20 of the women were assigned as laundresses, four to each company. All of the clothing pay allowance was sent back to the church and the families of the men in Council Bluffs to help them cross the plains to the valley of the Salt Lake. The men were each issued a musket, bayonet, scabbard, cartridge box and leather belt. A white belt was the only clothing which they all had in common. They were also each issued a blanket, canteen & knapsack, and each mess group of six was issued cooking pots and a tent. Each of the five companies was allowed to buy a wagon with a four mule team, in which they could carry their gear.

On August 13th they started with orders to go to Bent's Fort, Colorado. Colonel Allen was too sick to lead the men and stayed at the fort. Capt. Hunt would be in command until Col. Allen could rejoin the group. On August 26th at Bluff Creek, Kansas, word reached the battalion of Col. Allens death. On the 29th, Lieutenant Andrew Smith and Dr. George Sanderson arrived from the fort to take command of the battalion, with orders to go directly to Santa Fe now that it had been captured by Kearny's advance party. Most of the men wanted Capt. Hunt to continue the command since he out ranked Lt. Smith, but the officers voted to give the command to Lt. Smith since he was a career soilder and West Point graduate. However, Lt. Smith did not like volunteers, let alone Mormon volunteers. Also, because the battalion's re-supplies had been sent ahead to Bent's Fort and they were now ordered to go to Santa Fe, the men were put on half rations.

Just after they left the Arkansas River a sick detachment was sent to Pueblo, Colorado, via Bent's Fort. Many of the men were sick from exposure to the elements and Dr. Sanderson (Dr. Death) prescribed a dose of calomel powder and arsenic, no matter what was wrong with them. The men marched sick, under fed and under clothed, from water hole to water hole all the way to Santa Fe, arriving October 12, 1846.

At Santa Fe they were given a new commander, Colonel Philip St. George Cooke, who had been with Kearny's advance party, but was sent back to take command after Kearny learned of Allens death. Col. Cooke told the men that they had orders to make a new wagon road to the Pacific along a southern route, something that had never been done. From here another sick detachment left for Pueblo with all of the remaining women except five and all of the remaining children except one boy.

On October 18th, they left Santa Fe with 25 government wagons and 60 days rations, 5 company wagons and 12 private family wagons. Upon learning that Gen. Kearny had abandoned his wagons, Col. Cooke also brought along pack saddles for the mules. He also ordered that the men be organized into messes of ten men each. On the 24th they arrived at Albuquerque and exchanged some mules. From here they traveled south down the western side of the Rio Grande River. Just before they left the river they sent another sick detachment back to Pueblo, leaving 335 men in the battalion. On Nov. 13th they left the Rio Grande and began blazing a new wagon trail. Rations to the men were again reduced.

From here the men blazed a new road through the southwestern part of New Mexico into Mexico and up into Arizona along the San Pedro River Valley. On December 11th as they were watering the animals, some wild bulls got in with the cattle and were killed by the sheep drovers. Later that day another group of wild bulls charged the men and a short but wild melee ensued. The rampaging bulls charged on and on as they attacked men, mules and wagons. Three men were wounded, three mules were gored to death and several wagons were tipped over. Corporal Frost was charged by a bull from one hundred yards, took aim and fired when it was ten paces from him and it dropped at his feet. Col. Cooke later said of the man, ""One of the bravest men he ever saw."" It is not known how many bulls were killed in all, but one person reported nine dead in one spot. Many reported over 20 dead in all and maybe three times that many wounded.

Just before they arrived at Tucson, the garrison of Mexican soldiers stationed there had fled to the south on hearing of their coming. After a short stay they marched north to the Gila River and the Pima Indian villages. From here they basically followed the southern edge of the Gila River to the Yuma crossing of the Colorado. From there to Mexicali, then north to Palm Springs, following the San Luis River through the Temecula Valley arriving at San Luis Rey January 27, 1847. Much of this route later became known as the Spanish Trail, San Antonio-San Diego Route and the Butterfield Stage Line.

On July 31, 1846, a large group of Mormons arrived at El Paraje de Yerba Buena (The Place of the Good Herb), later called San Francisco, aboard the ship Brooklyn, under the leadership of Samuel Brannan. This was a month after the Bear Revolt had taken place and soon after Commander Montgomery aboard the USS Portsmouth had taken control of the area for the US without a shot being fired. The local Mexican General at the Presidio and many of the local residents of the bay area having fled to the south.

Upon reaching California the battalion learned that it had already been secured from Mexico by Fremont and Kearny, but all was not peaceful. John C. Fremont had been installed Governor of the state by Commodore Stockton. Lt. Col. Fremont along with Commodore Stockton were refusing to take orders from Gen. Kearny, who had been given orders by President Polk to be the Governor of California after it was secured. With the arrival of the battalion loyal to Kearny, he then had more than enough men to enforce his authority. From here the battalion was split with one company going to San Diego and four companies, along with Henry, going to Pueblo de Los Angeles, where they built Fort Moore. At some point during the trip Henry was promoted from Private to Corporal.

On May 31, 1847, 15 members of the battalion along with Gen. Kearny and other officers left Monterey with Lt. Col. John C. Fremont, taking him back to Fort Leavenworth for court-martial. This group was the first to discover the remains of the Donner Party at Truckee Lake, other than the original rescue parties. It was a gruesome sight of dismembered bones and body parts!

When the battalion was discharged July 16, 1847, at Fort Moore, the government tried to get as many men as possible to re-enlist for another six months. Henry was one of 79 who did, and they spent their time stationed at San Diego. There he was promoted to Sergeant. About 118 of the men headed east to Lake Arrowhead and then later northeast to the valley of the Salt Lake. About 105 other men traveled north to the Coloma area and worked for Captain John A. Sutter at his fort and mill, where gold was discovered January 24, 1848. Six of these men became The California Star Express riders, carrying printed word of the gold discovery back to the east, starting the California gold rush.

After the volunteers were released in San Diego on March 14, 1848, half went northeast to Utah and the other half, as well as Henry, traveled north to Yerba Buena and the gold fields.

Many of these men left in 1848 and headed back east to Utah. It is not known exactly when Henry left, but we know that he was in Salt Lake City when his parents arrived there September 17, 1850.

About 26 members of the battalion died during the the trip and never made it back to their families, though not a single shot was fired in battle, except during the battle with the bulls. The battalion proved the worth of this area which was later to become the Gadsden Purchase. They pioneered the southern emigration route, as well as the Carson Pass route through the Sierra Nevada's.

While living for a short time in Salt Lake City and building a mill race for Archibald Gardner with his father and brothers, Henry met and married Mary Mariah Chase January 16, 1851. She was the younger sister of one of his fellow battalion soldiers.

Henry and his new bride then moved to Hobble Creek with the rest of his family. I do not know what happened to this marriage, or if there were any children from it.

On July 24, 1863, Henry married Almira Mehitabel Meacham, who had eight children from two previous marriages. At some time, probably during the late 1860's, he moved back to northern California with his family and lived in Healdsburg, Sonoma, California, where he died November 17, 1896, leaving no known children that I know of, other than his second wife's.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Why constraining your sustainability strategy is a smart move

Is a commitment to sustainability a real strategic advantage? Or are companies voluntarily tying one hand behind their backs?

In recent weeks, I’ve been thinking a lot about the incentives, and disincentives, implied by an aggressive sustainability strategy. I participated in a great panel discussion focused on the link between innovation and sustainability, describedhere.

The panel was moderated by Phil Metz of Singing Dog and featured Mike Biddle from MBA Polymers, Mikhail David from Interface, Beto Lopez from IDEO and myself. We discussed some very interesting concepts, primarily dealing with how effectively innovation processes can deliver social and environmental wins, and conversely, how sustainability can be framed and employed as an opportunity innovation.

In one exchange, Beto described the sustainability director’s role as anticipating a future set of operating conditions for a company and making them relevant and actionable in the present tense. I love this description. It focuses on the importance of understanding a wide body of social, environmental, commercial, economic and other inputs, interpreting them into relevant terms for an organization and creating ways to integrate this information into the decision-making process — be it product design, operational, strategic or otherwise.

The central question I arrived at was this: If a sustainability director’s job is to effectively understand and communicate a set of future constraints, be they in terms of resource pricing, material choices or operational context, why would any company voluntarily move to a more constrained and likely more costly mode of operations any earlier than required by legislation, scarcity, or other drivers?

I think there are five reasons why taking this step makes sense. To start, there is a multi-faceted first mover advantage for the company that enters and defines a new market. The chance to create the ecosystem in which all future competitors will play isn’t a guarantee of success, but it does mean that competition is on your terms. In effect, being there at the start gives a company a role in the decision to go Beta vs VHS. Mike Biddle cautioned on the risk and cost to the first mover’s investment in creating this landscape — in his company’s case, this meant solving many of the technical and market challenges in recovering plastics from a wide range of waste streams.

An additional first mover advantage is the increased time an early player has to build capacity and expertise in a new set of conditions. For example, a company that has been building waste reduction goals into their operations for many years — such as DuPont — can rely on efficiency as a source of competitive advantage relative to competitors who don’t develop these abilities. As another example, Method had over five years of experience developing high efficacy phosphate-free auto dish detergents by the time regulation pushed the big players to remove phosphates from their own formulations. When they struggled with performance issues, Method’s product had addressed the technical challenges and its market share grew 40 percent over the year following the regulatory change.

Third, and most importantly from Method’s perspective, is finding ways to turn sustainability constraints from limitations into advantages. We aggressively focus on making resource efficiency, materials selection and responsible manufacturing into drivers of better product experience. Method’s8x concentrated laundry detergent is a great example of how an impressive resource savings from a super-concentrated detergent directly leads to an easier and better user experience.

Fourth, establishing a reputation for leadership in sustainability can attract partners, collaborators and suppliers interested in social and environmental co-development. This effectively creates a new funnel for innovation to product development activities, potentially bringing a series of new ideas into the pipeline. Method has benefited from a surge in calls from novel green chemistry or low-carbon materials in recent years, largely driven by our ability to get previous such materials to market.

Lastly, green product development can offer market differentiation. Truly excellent environmental design is still a rarity. Despite 70 – 80 percent of surveyed U.S. consumers saying that they prefer to buy greener goods, actual purchase rates are at 5 to 10 percent. A part of this “green gap” can be attributed to green products that just don’t deliver what users expect. Companies that can address the technical challenges involved in creating and producing the first truly excellent green offerings in their categories have an amazing upside on their hands.

The discerning reader will notice that I have not listed any public or reputational benefits that could derive from a sustainability strategy. Other writers have correctly pointed to upsides in talent attraction and retention, brand value and social license to operate, among others. However, I would argue that many of these benefits could be experienced by companies that have not committed to materially changing their businesses in order to operate within a realistic set of future conditions, but rather have made some select changes, released well-publicized CSR reports, or issued compelling CEO statements while most of the business proceeds as usual.

There are clearly upsides and downsides for those companies that do acknowledge and react to their best understanding of future operating conditions. Where the balance between these two lies likely depends on the company’s culture and competitive context. In Method’s case, there is amazing overlap between the opportunities for value creation and the ethical imperative to address social and environmental problems. This overlap has led to the growth of our company so far and will continue to be the basis of how we think about designing better products, operating more efficiently and running our company more effectively. In effect, social and environmental constraints define our opportunities rather than limit them.

"Two confirmed human cases of West Nile Virus in Colorado

KUSA — State health officials confirm two people have tested positive for West Nile virus in Colorado. The cases, out of Weld County and Delta County, are the first reported human cases of the virus in 2018.

CDPHE says most humans who contract the virus, about 80 percent, will not have any symptoms. About 20 percent of people will show symptoms, which are similar to the flu. State health officials said about 1 percent of people who test positive for West Nile virus will develop a more serious, potentially deadly illness.

Last year, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle was one of the lucky ones.

“I never had a symptom, I never felt sick,” said the longtime sheriff of Boulder County. “I go to Bonfils [Blood Center] every six weeks and donate blood and did that, and got a call and they said, you’ve got West Nile!”

Because Pelle didn’t have any symptoms or sickness, his recovery was pretty simple. He just had to wait for the virus to pass before he could donate blood again.

However, he is extra careful this time of year.

“We all live in Colorado for a reason, and I like to do all kind of outdoor activities including fishing and hiking and horseback riding and golf and I’m not going to quit doing that,” he said. “But I got a can of OFF in my golf bag, and I take precautions when I need to when the mosquitos are out.”

CDPHE said there were 68 human cases of West Nile virus in 2017, and four of those were fatal.

CDPHE also shared the following tips to protect yourself and your home:

Use insect repellents when you go outdoors. Repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, and some oil of lemon eucalyptus and para-menthane-diol products provide the best protection. Follow label instructions.

Limit outdoor activities at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus are most active.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Dextr Focuses Your Email Inbox on the People Who Matter

Recently, Gmail announced a new way of displaying email that presumably cleans up your inbox and makes you more organized — you can read more about it in Mark Wilson’s review. After using it on both the desktop and my phone, I’ve got to say they’ve done a good job. However, one thing they have not implemented yet is a priority inbox for close family and friends. While the Primary inbox does a nice job of filtering out automatic emails from social networks, shopping sites, and more, there is no way to differentiate work from personal email.

That’s where Dextr comes in. The app bills itself as a new mail experience that brings you closer to the people you love. Dextr’s goal is clear: to make it easier for you to communicate with the people you care about the most.

Getting Started

When you first start up Dextr, you are taken through a few tutorial screens that show you how to use it, as well as help you connect it to your Gmail account.

Right now, since Dextr is still in beta, it only supports Gmail. The team is currently taking suggestions on what other services to support.

2 of the 4 tutorial screens

You will then have the option to select which contacts from your address book you want to add to your Friends list, which serves as your inbox filter. Dextr will then look at your Gmail inbox and pull out emails from those contacts.

Your inbox and Friends list

After the initial setup, if you want to add more friends/family, you can simply swipe from right to left to reveal a full contact list and add more friends.

Viewing Email

To be honest, there isn’t much to say here about viewing email. Select an email from your inbox and you can read the content. When an email comes with attachments, you can view a list of all of them on a separate screen. Supported files will even show up inline. At this point, only images seem to fit the bill. Still, it’s a nice touch.

From the email screen you can reply, move a message to the trash, mark as unread, star, or archive. Much like any other inbox, reading an email will not remove it from your list; only deleting or archiving it (either from the app or from Gmail) will remove it.

The “Only” Two Other Features

As interesting as this might sound, there are only two other features in the entire app: the ability to send email and Settings/Feedback.

Send email and Settings

While the email in your inbox is limited to only contacts you add to your Friends list, sending email has no such limitations. Simply start typing a contact’s name or email and it will show up in the address box. Compose the email and press Send!

Smartly, if you email someone who is not on your Friends list, he or she will not automatically get added to it. This ensures that people can use Dextr as their primary mobile email app: checking only incoming messages from important Contacts while still being able to compose and send messages to everyone else.

As far as Settings go, you can see from the screen above that there isn’t too much going on: you can change accounts, change your name, and add a signature. There is also an About and Feedback area.

Simple and Beautiful

I actually really like that I was table to tell you everything about Dextr in less than 500 words. Granted, it is still in beta and the feature list could grow considerably between now and the “official” release, but that doesn’t seem to be Dextr’s MO. The whole reason for the app is to get a much cleaner version of your inbox based on the people you actually want to communicate with. The developers give you a great app with the best possible way to de-clutter: you create a much smaller list of contacts and only allow messages from those people to reach you.

The User Interface is consistent with the idea of simplicity. There is no clutter and it follows the Holo guidelines, as well as the new Cards UI look, really well. When you have email in your inbox from friends, Dextr displays that; when you don’t Dextr suggests starting a conversation and lists three of your friends. There is one button on the bottom to compose; that’s it. It also includes what are becoming common UI interactions for touch screens: pull from the top down to refresh your inbox, swipe side-to-side to reveal extra screens and menus. This is all very consistent with Dextr’s goal: promote simplicity. Using interactions that are already familiar to you means there’s a much lower learning curve.

The Future of Dextr

I see a lot of potential with Dextr. Right now, it’s strictly another layer on top of GMail to filter your email. However, moving forward I can see it growing to be more than just a Gmail app. In future releases they have promised push notifications and hinted at added support for other email clients, but we communicate through more than just email.

I can see Dextr evolving into a full-blown messaging app that combines email, text messaging, and other services — Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts maybe? — into a simple interface while still limiting what gets through to you based on your Friends list. I think this would be a pretty amazing app because it allows you to stay connected to the people you care about without being bothered by work, email lists, and favors unless you are in front of a computer or manually checking those services. Dextr has the potential to make the phone more personal again, and that is a smart approach I can get behind.

"CPAC: Ron Paul wins CPAC straw poll - ends Romney's CPAC domination

ByJimmy OrrFebruary 20, 2010

Texas Congressman Ron Paul won the CPAC straw poll on Saturday with 31 percent of the vote. Mitt Romney came in second with 22 percent and Sarah Palin finished third with a distant seven percent of the vote. The CPAC straw poll comes at the end of the three day conference.

Attendees of CPAC, or as Chris Matthewsonce called it a ""Star Trek convention,"" cast their ballots on the third and final day of the conference and Paul was the clear winner with 31 percent of the vote.

Mitt Romney was unable to keep a ""Vulcan grip"" on his three-year reign as CPAC's top vote getter netting 22 percent of the ballots for a solid second place finish. Perhaps rap-loving Republicans were sending a message to Romney that they disapproved of his problem solving skills on that airplane the other night.

There may have been some boos, but Paul was by far one of the more popular speakers at CPAC this year,"" Costa writes.

""While Paul mingled with his acolytes, the big guns — Pawlenty, Romney — were often shrouded by aides or mingling backstage,"" he adds. ""Believe me: CPAC folks noticed. And now, thanks to the straw poll, for a moment, Paul’s opening line from his address is true: His 'revolution is alive and well,' at least this weekend.""

Disclaimer: This doesn't count

"John D. Pettineo v. Ge Money Bank

IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA

March 29, 2011

JOHN D. PETTINEO, PLAINTIFF,v.GE MONEY BANK,DEFENDANT.

The opinion of the court was delivered by: Schiller, J.

MEMORANDUM

Defendant GE Money Bank (""GE"") sent Plaintiff John Pettineo a letter denying his application for a credit card. Pettineo alleges that this denial and a disclosure at the bottom of the GE form letter he received violate the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (""ECOA""). GE's motion to dismiss and Pettineo's response are presently before the Court. For the reasons that follow, GE's motion will be granted in part and denied in part.

I. BACKGROUND

Pettineo tried to use his ShopNBC credit card in October of 2008. (Am. Compl. ¶ 9.) The card was denied. (Id.) Pettineo called ShopNBC and discovered that the card had been canceled for inactivity. (Id.) He could not reopen his account, but had to apply for a new credit card. (Id.)

GE underwrote Pettineo's ShopNBC card. (Id.) Pettineo applied over the phone with GE's customer service department for another ShopNBC credit card. (Id. ¶ 10.) He received a written denial from GE on December 23, 2008. (Id. ¶ 11.) In this letter, GE offered three reasons for the denying Pettineo credit: (1) past due bankcards; (2) revolving trades with past due balances; and (3) bank revolving accounts with past due balances. (Am. Compl. Ex. A [GE Letter].) Pettineo alleges he was qualified for credit, but that GE denied his application because he previously sued under various federal statutes, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and the ECOA. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 25-26.)

GE's letter to Pettineo features a disclosure reciting non-discrimination policies the ECOA requires creditors to observe. The text of this disclosure reads:

ALL PERSONS TO WHOM THIS LETTER IS ADDRESSED:

The federal equal credit opportunity act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract), because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Protection Act. The federal agency that administers compliance with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act for the creditor identified on the front page of this letter is shown below. (GE Letter.) The letter provides contact information for the different government agencies which oversee the ECOA compliance of GE, GE Capital Financial, Inc., and General Electric Capital Corporation. (Id.) A paragraph at the top of the letter states that ""[r]equests for a copy of your credit report should be sent to the credit reporting agency listed in the bottom portion of this notice."" (Id.) The letter includes contact information for Equifax Credit Information Services, which it identifies as the source of information used by GE in reaching its decision to deny Pettineo credit. (Id.)

The disclosure and federal agency contacts are located toward the bottom of the letter, typed in ""a type set of eight (8) point or smaller,"" rendering them ""practically illegible"" to Pettineo. (Am. Compl. ¶ 18.) Pettineo claims he ultimately had to use ""magnification"" to read the disclosure. (Id. ¶ 23.) However, at the time he received the letter, he did not read the disclosure because he assumed it was ""meaningless print that had no bearing or significance"" due to its small size. (Id. ¶ 22.) This section of the letter includes a notice informing Pettineo that he had the right to request a free copy of Equifax's report within sixty days of his receipt of GE's letter. (GE Letter.)

Pettineo claims he was unaware of his right to request a free credit report because of the notice's small type. (Am. Compl. ¶ 24.) When he realized he had a right to request a free credit report, the deadline had passed. (Id.) Pettineo also alleges he was ""unaware that he was a member of a protected class"" under the ECOA because he initially did not read the disclosure. (Id. ¶ 22.)

Pettineo seeks over $150,000 to compensate him for ""severe anxiety attacks"" he suffered due to GE's conduct. (Id. ¶ 45.) He also seeks an injunction barring GE from issuing ""any further correspondence which fails to clearly and conspicuously reveal the disclosure language"" at issue, punitive damages, and costs. (Id.) Additionally, Pettineo requests ""the opportunity to discuss potential class action status, remedy and treatment with competent counsel and [to] amend [his] Complaint accordingly under FRCP 23."" (Id.)

In addition to the letter Pettineo received from GE in December of 2008, Pettineo attaches a second letter to his Amended Complaint. This letter, dated October 14, 2008, informs Pettineo that GE and Wal-Mart had reduced the available credit on his Wal-Mart account. (Am. Compl. Ex. B. [Wal-Mart Letter].) This letter does not include the disclosures in fine print on its face, but recites them in a uniform font size on its reverse. (Id.) Pettineo asserts that this second letter complies with the ECOA's notice requirement, and speculates that GE's apparent use of compliant and non-compliant form letters simultaneously demonstrates that GE may continue to use letters that do not effectively convey the ECOA disclosure. (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 38, 40-41.)

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW

The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandate dismissal of complaints which fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The Court accepts ""as true all of the allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom,"" viewing them in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515 F.3d 224, 233 (3d Cir. 2008); Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir. 1997). The Court will construe Pettineo's complaint liberally, as he brings this action pro se. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972); Smith v. Sch. Dist. of Phila., 112 F. Supp. 2d 417, 423 (E.D. Pa. 2000).

The Third Circuit applies a two-part analysis to determine whether claims should survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Fowler v. UPMC Shadyside, 578 F.3d 203, 210-11 (3d Cir. 2009). The Court must first separate the factual and legal elements of each claim, accepting well-pleaded facts as true but disregarding legal conclusions. See id. Second, the Court must determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show a plausible claim for relief. See id. at 211 (citing Phillips, 515 F.3d at 234-35). If the well-pleaded facts ""do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct,"" the Court should dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. See Jones v. ABN Amro Mortg. Grp., 606 F.3d 119, 123 (3d Cir. 2010).

Pettineo's First Amended Complaint presents two claims under the ECOA: a discrimination claim and a claim arising from GE's allegedly deficient disclosure notice. Pettineo pleads a plausible discrimination claim under the ECOA. However, the Court will dismiss his claim arising from the small font in GE's letter.

A. ECOA Discrimination

To establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ECOA, a plaintiff must establish that: (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he applied for credit; (3) he was qualified for credit; and (4) credit was nevertheless denied. Anderson v. Wachovia Mortg. Corp., 621 F.3d 261, 268 n.5 (3d Cir 2010). Pettineo alleges membership in a protected class under § 1691(a)(3), which prohibits discrimination against plaintiffs who have in good faith exercised a right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (""CCPA""). 15 U.S.C. § 1691(a)(3); see also Lewis v. ACB Bus. Servs., Inc., 135 F.3d 389, 406 (6th Cir. 1998). The parties also do not dispute that Pettineo applied for credit. However, GE argues that Pettineo has failed to allege facts supporting his allegations that he was qualified for credit or that he was denied credit because of his litigation history. (Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss 15.)

Pettineo alleges that he was qualified for credit. (Am. Compl. ¶ 26.) He also claims that the information GE used to determine his creditworthiness was inaccurate. (Id.) These allegations satisfy the third element of an ECOA claim for the purposes of a motion to dismiss. Pettineo likewise satisfies the fourth element of this claim by alleging that GE denied him credit due to ""previous exercise[s] of his rights"" under the statute. (Id. ¶ 25.) The Court will therefore deny GE's motion with respect to Pettineo's ECOA discrimination claim.

B. CCPA Disclosure Requirements

Pettineo does not take issue with the content of the disclosure in GE's letter. (Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Pl.'s First Am. Compl. [Pl.'s Resp.] 3.) Rather, Pettineo contends that the letter did not effectively convey this disclosure information to him and others similarly situated because the font was too small. (Id.) Specifically, Pettineo asserts that the body of the letter ""overshadowed"" the disclosure because the disclosure was printed in much smaller type than the rest of the letter. (Id. at 6-7.)

Pettineo also argues that GE inhibited consumers from contacting oversight agencies by including oversight information for three separate, similar-sounding GE sister-companies: GE Money Bank, GE Capital Financial, Inc., and General Electric Capital Corporation. (Id. at 19.) Each of these companies has a separate oversight agency contact listed on the letter. (GE Letter.) Pettineo was thus unsure whether GE Money Bank ""was either just a self-proclaimed pseudonym for General Electric Company . . . to insulate [it] from any and all wrongdoing . . . or possibly a company merely involved in fraud in the inducement."" (Id. at 20.)

1. ECOA notice requirements

The ECOA authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to issue regulations implementing the statute, including its notice provisions. 15 U.S.C. § 1691b; see also 12 C.F.R. § 202.1. These regulations, known collectively as Regulation B, mandate that creditors must provide required disclosures ""in a clear and conspicuous manner . . . in a form the applicant may retain."" 12 C.F.R. § 202.4(d). The Federal Reserve's Official Staff Interpretations clarify that the ""clear and conspicuous"" standard ""requires that disclosures be presented in a reasonably understandable format in a way that does not obscure the required information. No minimum type size is mandated, but the disclosures must be legible, whether typewritten, handwritten, or printed by computer."" 12 C.F.R. § 202 Supp. I; see also Williams v. MBNA Am. Bank., N.A., 538 F. Supp. 2d 1015, 1021 (E.D. Mich. 2008).

In the absence of other authority, GE urges the Court to adopt the Williams court's conclusion that the ""clear and conspicuous"" standard requires merely that a creditor provide ""visible"" disclosures. (Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss 9-10.) This reasoning follows interpretations of a ""clear and conspicuous"" standard found in the Consumer Leasing Act. Williams, 538 F. Supp. 2d at 1021. The Williams analysis focuses solely on the ""mode of presentation, not the degree of comprehension. So long as a disclosure is visible, it has satisfied the clear and conspicuous requirement . . . even if it is incomprehensible to the average consumer."" Id. at 1022.

Pettineo suggests that the Court look instead to cases involving the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (""FDCPA""), which analyze consumer communications under a ""least sophisticated consumer"" standard. See Ellis v. Solomon and Solomon, P.C., 591 F.3d 130, 135 (2d Cir. 2010). Pettineo suggests that decisions interpreting the FDCPA offer a better source of authority in ECOA cases than the Consumer Leasing Act does, as the FDCPA and ECOA share a common consumer-protection purpose under the CCPA. (Pl.'s Resp. 5.) Pettineo also contends that the Court may not determine whether GE's notice complies with the ECOA on a motion to dismiss, as this matter is ""a question of fact for the jury to determine."" (Id. at 4.)

GE's notice effectively communicates the required disclosure information. For example, with respect to Pettineo's right to receive a free copy of his credit report, the letter includes directions for obtaining a free copy of his credit report from the credit reporting agency at the top of the page in relatively large font. (See GE Letter.) Pettineo's confusion as to GE's oversight agency likewise does not constitute an actionable ECOA violation. Even a gullible, naive, or unsophisticated consumer could quickly determine which agency administered compliance for which GE company simply by contacting one of the oversight agencies listed. These issues thus do not give rise to a claim for violation of the ECOA's notice provision. Finally, Pettineo's decision that the disclosure information was unimportant because it was printed in relatively small font is inconsistent with the least sophisticated consumer standard's presumption that consumers read such notices with care. See Wilson, 225 F.3d at 354-55. The Court will therefore dismiss Pettineo's claims with respect to the ECOA's disclosure requirements.

C. Punitive Damages and Attorneys' Fees

Pettineo's Amended Complaint seeks punitive damages under the ECOA. (Am. Comp. ¶ 45.) GE contends that Pettineo's ""conclusory allegations of extreme and outrageous conduct"" are insufficient to support this punitive damages claim. (Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss 16-17.) The ECOA permits aggrieved applicants to recover punitive damages of $10,000 or less, regardless of proof of actual damages, if the defendant's conduct was wanton, malicious, or oppressive, or if the defendant acted in reckless disregard of the law. 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(b). The Court may fairly infer from Pettineo's Amended Complaint that he alleges GE intentionally denied him credit because he has previously exercised his rights under the CCPA. These allegations are sufficient to sustain Pettineo's punitive damages claim on a motion to dismiss.

The Court will grant GE's motion with respect to Pettineo's claims arising from the ECOA's disclosure requirements. Because Pettineo has alleged plausible claims for discrimination and punitive damages, the Court will permit these claims to proceed. An Order consistent with this Memorandum will be docketed separately.

"Business partners Martin Wilcocks and Craig Blackwell have bought 122 Old Hall Street, which is well known to motorists for its curved mirrored glass facade on the corner of Old Hall Street and Leeds Street.

The three storey-high building was built in the 1980s by the Moores family for its Littlewoods empire.

Today Shop Direct, which now owns the Littlewoods and Very.co.uk brands, still has some operations in the 32,000 sq ft complex.

Its new owners say they are now considering plans for the building and adjoining land and will announce their redevelopment plans next year.

Mr Blackwell, who runs property investment firm Prospect Capital, said: “It gives us great pleasure to announce the purchase of this iconic site on Old Hall Street.

“The site is positioned, as we see it, at the gateway to the central business district of Liverpool city centre.

“With outlooks across to the city and the River Mersey this sits in a key position on the city landscape.”

"Michael Brantley also homered and had three hits for Cleveland, which won at Yankee Stadium for the first time in eight games. Ramirez hit a two-run drive in the second inning and had three hits.

Derek Jeter had an infield single in the sixth inning to pass Honus Wagner for sixth on the career list with No. 3,431. But New York was 0 for 9 with six strikeouts with runners in scoring position in losing for just the second time in eight games.

Kluber (13-6) did not allow a hit until Jacoby Ellsbury doubled with one out in the fourth. He struck out 10 to beat New York for the first time in three tries. The right-hander has allowed only one earned run since the ninth inning of a win against Detroit on July 19. He has won five straight decisions.

Before the game, the Yankees honored Paul O'Neill with a plaque to be placed in Monument Park.

O'Neill was humbled to know that his plaque will be among the many Yankees greats feted in Monument Park beyond the center field wall at Yankee Stadium.

In nine years with the Yankees, the right fielder hit .303 with 185 homers and 858 RBIs. He helped New York win four World Series titles and five AL pennants from 1996-2001. O'Neill won the 1994 AL batting title.

Also prior to the game, the Yankees placed catcher Brian McCann on the seven-day concussion list less than a day after he was hit in the facemask by a foul ball and gave second baseman Brian Roberts his unconditional release. Roberts was hitting .237 with five homers and 21 RBIs when he was cut on Aug. 1 to make room for infielder Stephen Drew.

Blue Jays 3, Tigers 2: Nolan Reimold hit a game-winning double in the 10th inning as host Toronto spoiled Max Scherzer's bid to become the first 14-game winner in the American League.

Danny Valencia singled off Joba Chamberlain to begin the 10th, and Reimold followed with a double to the wall in left-center as Valencia scored without a play.

Scherzer allowed one run and four hits in eight innings. He walked none and struck out 11, two shy of his season high.

Chamberlain (1-5) came on to start the 10th after Joakim Soria, who finished the ninth, appeared to suffer a back injury while warming up before the inning.

Aaron Loup (4-3) worked one inning for the victory.

Toronto trailed, 2-1, through eight innings but Jose Reyes singled off Tigers closer Joe Nathan to begin the ninth, then stole second before advancing to third on Melky Cabrera's fly ball to right. Jose Bautista was intentionally walked to bring up Dioner Navarro, who grounded a tying single past a diving Miguel Cabrera at first base.

A wild pitch moved the runners to second and third before Colby Rasmus walked to load the bases, bringing Soria out of the bullpen to replace Nathan, who blew his sixth save in 30 chances.

Soria sent it to extra innings by getting Juan Francisco to pop up on the first pitch, then retiring Munenori Kawasaki on a ground ball.

Soria came back out to start the 10th but appeared to suffer an injury before throwing his first pitch, forcing manager Brad Ausmus to turn to Chamberlain.

Orioles 10, Cardinals 3: Caleb Joseph homered in his fifth consecutive game, Nelson Cruz hit his 30th, and Delmon Young also went deep for host Baltimore.

All three home runs came with a man on against John Lackey (1-1), making his second start since coming from Boston in a July 31 trade. The right-hander gave up nine runs and 13 hits in five-plus innings to fall to 14-8 lifetime against Baltimore.

The Orioles have hit nine homers in winning the first two games of the three-game set by a collective 22-5 score. Baltimore has won seven straight series and leads the AL East by six games, its largest margin since September 1997.

Joseph, a rookie, had three homers in first 48 games before his recent power surge. The club record for homers in successive games is six, by Reggie Jackson and Chris Davis.

Rays 4, Cubs 0: Jake Odorizzi struck out nine in six scoreless innings and combined with two relievers on a five-hitter for visiting Tampa Bay.

Evan Longoria drove in a run and scored two. Yunel Escobar added two hits and three RBIs. Ben Zobrist had two hits and scored twice for the Rays, who improved to a major league-best 15-6 since July 12. They will try to complete the three-game sweep today.

Odorizzi (8-9) gave up three hits and didn't walk anyone. The right-hander came within two strikeouts of his career high after getting hit hard in a loss to the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday.

Chicago starter Edwin Jackson (6-12) allowed four runs — three earned — and five hits in six innings. He is 1-5 in his past nine starts.

Royals 5, Giants 0: James Shields threw a four-hitter and Alex Gordon homered as host Kansas City won its sixth straight.

The Royals have won nine of 10 to move with 1½ games of AL Central-leading Detroit. The Royals, who have not made the playoffs since beating St. Louis in the 1985 World Series, are in second place in the AL wild card standings.

Shields (11-6) gave up three singles in the first four innings. He allowed only two Giants to reach second base. He walked Joe Panik in the fifth and he moved to second on a wild pitch with two outs, but was stranded. Panik doubled in the eighth.

Brewers 4, Dodgers 1: Mike Fiers held the Los Angeles Dodgers to three hits in his first big league start in more than a year, and Khris Davis and Carlos Gomez homered for host Milwaukee.

Fiers (1-1) struck out five in eight strong innings, filling in for injured veteran Matt Garza. The Dodgers mustered only a solo homer by Adrian Gonzalez into the second deck in right field.

Fiers outdueled former Brewers pitcher Zack Greinke (12-8), who gave up Gomez's homer off the left-field foul pole that made it 3-1 leading off the sixth.

Padres 2, Pirates 1: Eric Stults got his first road win of the season, going 6 innings for San Diego.

Stults (5-13) gave up one run and seven hits, struck out six and walked none. He entered the game with an 0-9 record away from Petco Park.

The Padres scored both runs in the first inning off Francisco Liriano (3-8).

Penny back with Marlins: Right-hander Brad Penny was called up Saturday by the Miami Marlins, reuniting him with his former team and former catcher 10 years later.

The Marlins picked Penny to start the second game of a series against the Cincinnati Reds. He swapped roster spots with left-hander Edgar Olmos, who was optioned to Triple-A New Orleans.

The 36-year-old pitcher has played for the Marlins, Dodgers, Red Sox, Giants, Cardinals and Tigers. He signed a minor league deal in June.

Penny went 48-42 with a 4.04 ERA with the Marlins from 2000-04, when Mike Redmond — the Marlins manager — was his catcher. He won 14 games on the Marlins team that won the World Series in 2003. His last start for the Marlins was July 28, 2004.

Penny hasn't played in the majors since 2012, when he made 22 relief appearances for the Giants. It was the first time in his career that he didn't make at least one start during a season. His last start in the majors was Sept. 25, 2011 for the Tigers.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Next steps uncertain for women with dense breasts

LAURAN NEERGAARD

Dec. 08, 2014

WASHINGTON (AP) — More women are learning their breasts are so dense that it's more difficult for mammograms to spot cancer. But new research suggests automatically giving them an extra test isn't necessarily the solution.

Screening isn't the only concern. Women whose breast tissue is very dense have a greater risk of developing breast cancer than women whose breasts contain more fatty tissue.

Laws in 19 states require women to be told if they have dense breasts after a mammogram, with Missouri's and Massachusetts' requirements taking effect in January. Similar legislation has been introduced in Congress.

What's not clear is what a woman who's told her breasts are dense should do next, if anything. Some of the laws suggest extra screening may be in order.

Not so fast, a team of scientists reported Monday. They modeled what would happen if women with dense breasts routinely received an ultrasound exam after every mammogram, and calculated such a policy would cost a lot, in extra tests and false alarms, for a small benefit.

For every 10,000 women who got supplemental screening between the ages of 50 and 74, three to four breast cancer deaths would be prevented — but 3,500 cancer-free women would undergo needless biopsies, the study concluded.

""Not everybody with dense breasts is going to get cancer. There are people with dense breasts that are not at high risk,"" explained study co-author Dr. Karla Kerlikowske of the University of California, San Francisco, who has long studied density.

Among the questions: How to tell which women really are at high risk, and how to better examine that group.

""We need to investigate alternative screening strategies for women with dense breasts,"" added epidemiologist Brian Sprague of the University of Vermont Cancer Center, who led the research published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

Topping that list: Scientists are beginning to study if a newer tool, 3-D mammograms, might get around the density problem by essentially viewing breast tissue from more angles.

Meanwhile, Sprague said his study could help women consider the trade-offs as they decide for themselves whether to pursue an ultrasound.

Mammogram reports to doctors have long included information about breast density. But it wasn't routinely shared with women until some cancer survivors, outraged at not knowing, began spurring state disclosure laws starting in Connecticut in 2009. The advocacy group that started the movement tracks the laws at http://www.areyoudense.org .

What's a woman to make of the information?

Monday's study ""reaffirms that we don't know exactly what the right thing to do is when a woman has dense breasts,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists doesn't recommend routine additional testing in women who have no symptoms or other risk factors.

UCSF's Kerlikowske said the real issue in deciding whether any woman needs extra screening — from an ultrasound to a more expensive MRI — is her overall risk of breast cancer.

Her team helped create an online risk calculator — https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk/ . Plug in age, breast density, if a close relative had breast cancer and a few other details. Putting the risk in perspective, the calculator compares the woman's chance of developing breast cancer over the next five years with that of an average woman the same age.

But to answer, you have to know just how dense your breasts are.

Radiologists divide density levels into four categories: Almost completely fatty, scattered areas of density, fairly widespread density and the less common extremely dense. There's no standard way to measure, cautioned the cancer society's Brawley. And those mailed notifications don't always give the woman's category, even though the cancer risk is highest for extremely dense tissue.

Density tends to decrease with age, so a woman's risk will change over time, Kerlikowske said. It also can reflect some other long-known risk factors, she added. Someone who had children very young probably will have fattier breasts by mammography age than a woman whose first birth was in her 30s.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Solar electricity isn't the only renewable energy whipping boy out there. Wind power has also taken more than its share of lumps, frequently saddled with a reputation for excessive noise and energy inefficiency. Plus, if some of the rumors are true, wind harvesters of the world have steadily been turning the planet's bird population into an airborne puree of blood and feathers.

To be fair, wind turbines do kill birds -- but so do vehicles, skyscrapers, pollution and the introduction of invasive species into their habitats. Humans have had bird blood on their hands for ages, and as daunting as a field of wind turbines may look, they're responsible for statistically few bird deaths -- less than 1 in every 30,000 [source: U.S. Department of Energy].

But even without the death cries of a thousand birds, aren't wind turbines a noise nuisance? Actually, modern turbine technology renders them relatively silent -- essentially no more than the soft, steady whine of wind through the blades. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, if you stand 750 feet (229 meters) away from a wind farm of multiple turbines, the noise would be no more than that of a working kitchen refrigerator. These aren't helicopter blades, after all. The Ontario Ministry of Environment breaks it down like this: If 0 decibels is the threshold of hearing and 140 is the threshold of pain, then a typical wind farm scores between 35 and 45, sandwiched between a quiet bedroom (35) and a 40-mile-per-hour (64-kilometer-per-hour) car (55).

Finally, there's the issue of cost. Like any energy production facility, there are plenty of upfront costs to harvesting wind energy, but research indicates that the average wind farm pays back the energy used in its manufacture within three to five months of operation [source: BWEA]. Since wind farms depend on variable weather patterns, day-to-day operating costs tend to run higher. Simply put, the wind isn't going to blow at top speed year-round. If it did, a wind turbine would produce its maximum theoretical power. In reality, a turbine only produces 30 percent of this amount, though it produces different levels of electricity 70 to 85 percent of the time [source: BWEA]. This means that wind power requires back-up power from an alternative source, but this is common in energy production.

Wind power demonstrates tremendous promise for the future -- and not just for the environment, but for the pocketbook as well. In 2005, the state of New York determined that a 10 percent addition of wind generation would reduce customer payments by $305 million in one year.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Satmar Rabbi in Kiryas Joel – Speaking in Code

Satmar Rabbi Aaron Teitlebaum Speaking in Riddles to His Followers…

Reporting to Civil Authorities Will Lead to Excommunication

May 22, 2016

This past Saturday, May 21, 2016, Rabbi Aaron Teitlebaum, the Satmar Rabbi of Kiryas Joel, called an urgent meeting of members of his community (the men) to discuss the events surrounding the death of Rabbi Yitzchak Rosenberg (zl).

During that meeting Rabbi Teitlebaum acknowledged that he had been, and will be again paid a visit by the FBI. He in riddles but in very certain terms stated that these visits are based upon outlandish ‘tales’ told by members of his community and then misconstrued by social media and the press.

Rabbi Teitlebaum held the meeting on Shabbat; but was very cognizant that perhaps there was someone in his own ‘Kehilah’ (community) who might be taping something. This is, as he acknowledged, despite a religious prohibition against the use of electronics. The tone was one of mistrust; and his comments were tempered and encoded to provide his community, his children, with a clear warning: “I do not trust you.”

Rabbi Teitlebaum commented that everything they say eventually winds up reaching the press; and sent a stern warning to members of his community not to speak with outsiders. He levied threats. He postulated that whomever it is in his Satmar community who might be taping his speech (informants), and who may be speaking to the FBI or otherwise ‘telling tales,’ would no longer be welcomed in the community.

Rabbi Teitlebaum wanted his community to be clear that any member who chooses to involve the civil authorities in personal Satmar events would be ex-communicated, at best, [and something more nefarious at worst].

We have posted a partial translation of his speech from Yiddish to Hebrew, which was posted in a Hebrew Newspaper name, loosely translated, the “Secret Rooms.” bhol.co.il

We will not even begin to try and translate the Hebrew into English because it would be an effort in futility, even for a speaker of all three of the languages. It is clear from the timing of the speech, from the references to certain passages in the bible and from the underlying riddles and tone that this was not a discussion to be taken lightly.

"“This,” said New York Times media writer David Carr, interviewing actor Oliver Platt, “is like a little baby bird of a film festival.”

The metaphor was apt. Opening on the very day the well-known 11th Tribeca Film Festival wrapped, the fledgling Montclair Film Festival, which has been discussed and organized and dreamed about for two years, finally cracked open its shell. The opening night crowd of 500 seemed almost like parents at a piano recital — anxious to laugh at every joke and applaud every speaker and let all the organizers know that yes, they had done a very good job.

“The Oranges,” directed by Julian Farino, and boasting an ensemble cast that included Hugh Laurie and Allison Janney in addition to Oliver Platt, is a comedy set in West Orange, N.J. about two close families that implode over an extramarital affair. Janney is especially hilarious as a controlling middle-aged mom. If the audience was disappointed that, aside from an opening shot of a West Orange sign, the other locations seemed off (the Essex Fells Motel? Puh-leeze!), they mostly kept their disappointment in check. Although the film turned out to have been shot in New Rochelle, Carr did his best in the Q&A afterwards to keep it local by asking Platt which tunnel he’d taken to get from Manhattan to Montclair (Lincoln), and festival programmer Thom Powers — before dismissing the audience to the reception — reminded filmgoers their parking tickets would be validated, “something we love in New Jersey.”

Celebrities included rocker Dave Matthews, whose film company ATO Pictures distributed “The Oranges,” Stephen Colbert, who got off from work too late to make the film but managed to get there in time for the party, and of course Platt. Evelyn Colbert was a driving force behind the festival.

When fellow baristas Georgette Gilmore, Kristen Kemp and I cornered Colbert, he made gracious small talk, told us he was a reader (!) and mentioned how important it was to grow up in a town with an arts festival. Then he quipped, “You’ll know it’s a real film festival when the filmmakers start having affairs with each other.”

Late in the reception, Bob Feinberg, the festival’s founder, told me the opening night was almost exactly as he’d pictured it.

“I thought about a banner across Bloomfield Avenue and I thought about all the signs and about doing an opening night in this theater,” Feinberg said. “I didn’t think about Dave Matthews, but that’s a nice plus.”

The six-day festival will run 49 events altogether and utilize the services of 263 volunteers. Eighteen events are already sold out. Tickets are still available for Wednesday night’s tribute to film star Kathleen Turner.

"Schizophrenia: A byproduct of the brain’s complex evolution?

New genetic evidence, published in the journal Schizophrenia, suggests that the condition is an “unwanted side effect” of the evolution of the complex human brain.

The human brain is complex, and in its equally complex evolution, schizophrenia may have come up as ‘an unwanted side effect.’

More and more studies have been illuminating the genetic components of schizophrenia, a condition that affects about 1 percent of the world’s population.

The largest twin study of schizophrenia put 79 percent of the risk of the condition down to genes, while another believed that genetic mutations in the brain’s glial cells may be responsible for the disorder.

Now, a new study conducted by three researchers from the Florey Institute for Neuroscience and Mental Health in Parkville, Australia, finds genetic changes in a frontal brain area commonly linked with schizophrenia traits, supporting the theory that the condition may be an undesired side effect of the human brain’s evolution.

Prof. Brian Dean, of Swinburne University’s Centre for Mental Health in Hawthorne, Australia, as well as the Florey Institute, is the new study’s corresponding author.

Altered gene expression found in frontal pole

Prof. Dean and colleagues conducted a postmortem examination of the brains of 15 people who had schizophrenia and 15 who did not.

The scientists measured the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) in the frontal pole of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the cingulate cortex. Using mRNA levels, the researchers predicted genetic pathways “that would be affected by the changes in gene expression.”

Schizophrenia risk gene plays key role in early brain development

Scientists identify a risk gene for the condition.

In the brains of people who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, the researchers found 566 instances of changes in genetic expression in the frontal pole of the brain and surrounding areas, which are regions known to be involved in schizophrenia-related traits.

As the study authors explain, “The frontal pole is critical in maintaining the cognitive flexibility that underpins human reasoning and planning abilities,” which are two functions “that are impaired in individuals with [schizophrenia].”

New genetic pathway uncovered

The study also uncovered a genetic pathway in the brain’s so-called Brodmann area that comprised interactions between 97 genes.

“A better understanding of changes in this pathway could suggest new drugs to treat the disorder,” says Prof. Dean. He goes on to explain the findings, saying, “It’s thought that schizophrenia occurs when environmental factors trigger changes in gene expression in the human brain.”

Such potential environmental triggers for epigenetic changes include pregnancy and delivery complications, as well as psychosocial stressors such as growing up in a dysfunctional family.

“Though this is not fully understood,” adds Prof. Dean, “our data suggest the frontal area of the brain is severely affected by such changes.”

“There is the argument that schizophrenia is an unwanted side effect of developing a complex human brain and our findings seem to support that argument.”

Prof. Brian Dean

“A major finding of this study,” the authors continue, “is that […] no gene had altered levels of expression in all three regions of the cortex from subjects with [schizophrenia].”

According to them, this means that in terms of gene expression, schizophrenia-related molecular changes are not uniform across the cortex.

“These data also raise the possibility that the symptoms of [schizophrenia] that are thought to result from the dysfunction of different cortical regions could be due to changes in gene expression specific to the cortical region thought to be central to the genesis of a symptom,” they say.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Kanye West, born Kanye Omari West, is a genius lyricist and rapper and self-proclaimed ""voice of a generation"". He attended Chicago State University, but dropped out, stating that college was too easy for a genius of his caliber. When asked about his performance in high school, he responded by saying ""Have you ever had sex with a Pharaoh? I put the pussy in a sarcophagus."" Like all other rappers, he became famous due to someone more famous and talented, Jay-Z in this case. West was involved in a near-fatal car crash in 2002, when, on his was home, a phoenix fell from the sky and crashed into his car. In November, 2010, West released a documentary about the car crash called ""Runaway"". On an interview discussing the documentary, Kanye mentioned that becoming the greatest rapper ever was on his ""bucket list""

Rise to Yeast

Kayne was named after Mae West as he had an inflated opinion of himself.

Kanye was a producer for many no-names in the late 90's, most of whom are not even worth mentioning. We could sit here and list Kanye's small-time producing in this time period, but you've never heard of any of these people, we promise. So let's save both our time by fast forwarding to 2000.

Kanye became famous through meeting Jay-Z, who quickly noticed Kanye's ass-kissing talent. Kanye always idolized Jay-Z, and told him how much he wanted to be just like him. Jay-Z, although already successful and famous, felt drawn in by Kanye's ass-kissing, which did wonders for Jay's ego. After all, who wouldn't want someone following them around telling them how great they are? This lead to Jay signing Kanye as a producer. Kanye has ever since felt that Jay-Z was his Big Brother.

Kanye West's first career productions came on Jay-Z's 2001 debut album The Blueprint, released on September 11, 2001. West produced some of the greatest hits on that album, such as Heart of the City and I.Z.Z.O. Kanye also thought he was “the shit” (but nobody knew of him yet) and starting “smoking them miracle herbs” and developed an addiction to them.

Kanye documents his rise to fame in a 13-hour interview named ""Last Call"" on his 2004 Album The College Dropout. Throughout the course of the interview, he frequently interrupts his story to yell ""This is the last call for alcohol!!!"", hence the title.

Controversy

What happened?

In the midst of Hurricane Katrina, there was a well publicized event in which Kayne West accused the president of hating black people. This was untrue. However rumor has it that fellow actor (and rising rap starlet) Hurricane Katrina Jones professed to Kayne West that he does in fact hate the way black people are sometimes treated, and Mexicans, and Jews, and Arabs.

The President later responded to West's comments with a note he wrote all by himself, and in early 2006 publicly asked Kanye if he would stop burning crosses on the White House lawn. Since December of 2006, no one knows if they even still talk to each other, which is sad, since they used to call each other every day.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Deputies said the woman can be seen removing a large amount of silver necklaces from a spinning display rack and then concealing them in her purse.

An inventory check revealed a total of 20 necklaces missing from the store, worth $504.80, deputies said.

Authorities said the loss prevention employee told deputies copies of video from the Wells Road, Oakleaf and Ortega Target stores show the same woman stealing merchandise and leaving the store.

Deputies described the woman as in her early 20s with a slim build, brown hair and wearing a black shirt and skirt with dark boots. Deputies said she was seen carrying two purses, one of which is large and gray with a black lower bottom portion. The store said she carried that bag when she was in the other Target stores as well, deputies said.

She left the store's parking lot in a silver four-door car that had a missing hubcap on the front, deputies said.

Anyone with information about the woman's identity is asked to contact the Clay County Sheriff's Office.

"LAUSD parents, teachers fight mainstreaming of disabled kids

Protesters line Balboa Boulevard in front of the office of LAUSD board member Tamar Galatzan, Wednesday, July 24, 2013. Parents and Teachers United for Action picketed to oppose the district's transitioning of special education students to regular education campuses. (Michael Owen Baker/Staff Photographer)

LAKE BALBOA - Waving signs and chanting ""Our kids, our choice,"" scores of Los Angeles Unified parents and teachers protested the looming transfer of hundreds of disabled students from special-education centers to traditional schools, as the district complies with laws to integrate students who have physical and developmental challenges.

The protesters oppose the merger of four special-education centers with nearby traditional schools, a move that will affect about 300 disabled youngsters when school starts next month. Opponents of the plan say the district will be segregating rather than integrating their kids by putting them in unsafe situations and setting them up for teasing or bullying. They say they want it to be their choice, not the district's, to transfer their kids to a traditional campus.

""They are celebrated at special-education centers for their abilities, not their inabilities,"" said Rhonda Berrios of West Hills, whose 19-year-old son, Michael, is profoundly autistic. ""They have dances, and basketball and baseball teams and cheerleading squads ... The district wants to throw them into a one-size-fits-all environment, and that would be a travesty if this happens.""

Michael is now enrolled at Leichman Special Education Center in Reseda, which under the district's plan will begin shifting high school students to traditional campuses in 2014. Berrios and others demonstrated for about 90 minutes in the sweltering heat on behalf of their children and those who might lose what they see as the advantages of a protected environment.

Tom Williamson of North Hills said his son Blair, who has Down syndrome, learned self-confidence and life skills during the years he spent at Leichman. Blair, now a 34-year-old actor, has credits that include roles on ""CSI"" and ""Scrubs.""

""He learned to go from classroom to classroom, and to the cafeteria,"" Williamson said. ""He was given freedom and independence that he wouldn't have had at a general education campus.""

The 100-or-so demonstrators targeted the office of school board member Tamar Galatzan, saying four of the district's 14 special-ed centers are located in her west San Fernando Valley district. Her office is also next door to the shuttered West Valley Special Ed Center, a building that now houses Daniel Pearl High. Protesters complained that Galatzan did nothing to block the closure of West Valley, although that was never a board decision.

Galatzan was working at her full-time job as a city prosecutor on Wednesday and was not at her LAUSD office, a spokeswoman said. Questions were referred to Sharyn Howell, executive director of LAUSD's Special Education Division, which serves about 83,000 students.Howell noted that the district is bound by federal and state law, as well as a federal consent decree, to mainstream more special-education students and give handicapped youngsters more opportunities to interact with kids at traditional campuses.

""We're talking about physical education, arts types of programs, computer labs and library time,"" she said. ""This is a chance to get the students with their siblings, cousins and neighborhood kids at a general-education site.""

They will continue to have classroom lessons that are appropriate for their level of learning, along with the aides, nurses, therapists and other supports they've had in the past, she added.

Los Angeles Unified spends nearly $1.5 billion annually on special-education programs, which have shifted over the years from stand-alone centers to mainstream classrooms. Beginning last year, preschoolers who might previously have been enrolled in special-ed centers started their education at a traditional school.Several demonstrators say they believe district officials are trying to whittle down the enrollment so they can eventually close all of the centers -- a move that Howell has previously denied.The district currently operates 14 special-ed centers, which last year served 2,190 students.

Under the plan set to take effect in August, Miller Special Ed Center in Reseda will transfer about 100 students to Cleveland High but will continue to provide its career-training program for ages 18-22.

About two dozen youngsters from Lull Special Education Center in Encino will enroll in Reseda High, the first step in transforming the facility to one for elementary students only. Next year, middle schoolers will go to Madison.Fifty kids at McBride School in Venice will go to Grand View Elementary, and Banneker School, near downtown L.A., will send 60 youngsters to Avalon Gardens.The Frances Blend School will merge with Van Ness Elementary in the Larchmont area, affecting about 40 blind and visually impaired students.

"Russia puts sweeping ban on U.S., E.U. food imports

Russia retaliated against western sanctions with a sweeping ban on food imports, marking a new low point in relations between the two since the end of the Cold War.

Under instructions from President Vladimir Putin, the government said it would ban for a year all imports of meat and poultry, seafood, milk and dairy products including cheese, fruit, vegetables and vegetable oil-based products from the U.S., E.U., Australia and Norway–all of whom have imposed sanctions of their own on Russia for the annexation of Crimea and its perceived role in stoking the violent uprising in eastern Ukraine.

There was no action to restrict the crucial flow of oil and gas exports, which are vital for the E.U. economy and for the Russian budget. Nor did the government announce any ban on overflight of Siberian airspace, although it did consider it.

Even so, the step signals a radical departure from Russia’s previous policy of trying to avoid harm to its own economy, which has never recovered its pre-crisis rates of growth, and which stagnated in the first half of this year.

“We hoped until the last minute that our colleagues would understand that sanctions are a blind alley that do no-one any good. But they didn’t understand and…we were forced to take reciprocal measures,” Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told cabinet in a televised meeting.

The move is extraordinary, in as much as Russia has found it much easier, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, to buy food than to produce it. It currently imports some 40% of its food, and the E.U. is its biggest trading partner, buying €3.3 billion ($4.4 billion) of fruit and vegetables last year and another €3.3 billion in meat and dairy products.

The U.S. shipped $1.3 billion of food products to Russia last year, according to the USDA.

But the ban seems likely to rebound on Russian consumers too, despite comments Wednesday by Putin urging the need to avoid that. Russia’s domestic producers are hardly in a position to replace all the items that will be lost over the next year (documented with curious delight here by state news agency Itar-Tass).

Even if imports can be substituted, they will likelier be more expensive than what they have replaced, which is in itself a development that will hit ordinary Russians, who have grown used to Italian Mozzarella cheese and Norwegian shrimp. Inflation is already running above target at 7.5% and food accounts for 29% of the basket of goods and services tracked by statistics office Rosstat.

The government claimed that the measures would be an opportunity for domestic producers, but such claims met with scorn by critics.

“Those who think sanctions will help Russian producers – remember the car industry. They’ve been ‘helping’ it with duties for 20 years,” Alexei Navalny, an opposition blogger and politician, said via his Twitter account.

Whatever else happens, there is a large chance that the sanctions could be undermined by either an unwillingness or an inability to enforce them. For example, there is little to stop Belarus–which sits between Poland and Russia–from re-exporting Polish fruit and vegetables to Russia, possibly by passing them off as its own.

Neither Belarus nor Kazakhstan, which are both in a customs union with Russia, have announced any sanctions, and Belarus in particular is in such a parlous economic state that it can ill afford to pass up opportunities to make a fast buck with such tricks. The news agency RIA Novosti reported that Russian officials would meet with their counterparts in Belarus August 12 to discuss the matter.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Weed Break Wednesday: Should Marijuana Be Legal?

States like Oregon, Washington and Colorado have already passed legislation that directly contradicts federal law. At the federal level, marijuana is today still classified as a schedule 1 substance. Even though new rulings will aid in protecting marijuana patients and businesses from federal recourse, the debacle over marijuana’s future in the U.S. is far from over.

Many support the legalization of marijuana for pragmatic reasons. Taxing marijuana sales brings much needed revenue to states and counties. Some argue regulating marijuana will help to snuff out the black market and undermine the vicious drug cartels cycle. Alternative medicine uses call for more improved access for research of cannabis health benefits. Some groups have aligned philosophically to argue, as was the case in Mexico, that access to cannabis is a basic human right, protected constitutionally.

Generationally and over time, as indicated by Pew Research Center, marijuana legalization has gained support in public opinion polls.

"The Path of Denominationalism: Authority in the Church

Previously we examined the concept of a denomination as being an institution, or an organizational structure that exists independently of any individuals. We saw from the Scriptures that the church that Christ established was not to resemble such institutions but ought to remain simply the collective of Christians that exist (the “church universal”) or a collective of Christians that live in a specific geographical level (the “church local”). Let us now continue the discussion of the path of denomination where we left off and discuss the ways that authority is viewed within denominations and, if necessary, how to avoid such perceptions.

All denominations will certainly claim that their authority is derived from the Scriptures and that they are the church that is presented in them; the truth of the matter, however, is more often than not much different. They may use the Scriptures and quote Scriptures to demonstrate their belief, but are their beliefs actually from the Bible or are they placed upon the Bible by the ideas of men? In practice, we may see that many denominations will use one of two different sources for authority: for simplicity’s sake, let us call these two sources a “cult of personality” and “collective determination.”

We may define a “cult of personality” as the belief in the words of an individual or a collective of individuals that are believed to possess authority through an understanding that they may have received of through power supposedly granted by virtue of a position held. We see the first kind of a “cult of personality,” one or more who have received some form of understanding, in many groups that were founded by an individual or a group of individuals because of such ideas, like the Lutheran church or the many Calvinist churches that exist today. The members of these churches say that the Scriptures are their sole authority in their lives, yet the Lutherans consider the Book of Concord as authoritative, for example, and the Calvinists will often refer to the works of Calvin or other men like him for their belief system. The second kind of a “cult of personality,” involving power that supposedly is derived from a position held, is seen most clearly in groups with an “ecclesiastical hierarchy,” such as the Roman Catholic church and the Church of England. The “bishops” and other figures in these churches are seen as figures of authority, supposedly given the authority that was vested in Peter in Matthew 16:19:

“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatever you bind on earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven.”

Therefore, the members of these denominations look up to these individuals as those holding keys of authority and will believe and do whatever these individuals tell them to do.

We may define “collective determination” as the belief in the authority of a decision made when reached by a collective of individuals that represent the members of a denomination. This is seen especially in many Protestant denominations today, with “synods” of the “pastors” and other such individuals in a denomination meeting to make decisions and statements that are binding upon the whole denomination. Often times it will be said that these are not meetings of the denomination necessarily, but a meeting of the heads of individual “churches” that meet to determine what is truth, supposedly similar to the events of Acts 15. In reality, a meeting of the heads of various churches of a denomination to determine what is truth and a meeting of the heads of churches for the same reason is the exact same idea and really the exact same thing.

Now that we have examined our terms, do we see that the church ought to place its authority in a “cult of personality” or in a “collective determination?” Let us see if it is so.

Many may appeal to the account in Acts 15 about the meeting of the elders of Jerusalem and of the Apostles, yet this meeting was nothing like what goes on today: in Jerusalem, only the church of Jerusalem had representatives, and the decisions made in that meeting were not of the volition of the elders or the Apostles but of the Holy Spirit.

Others may point to 1 Timothy 3:15, especially in defense of “collective determination”:

but in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.

It is argued that since the church is the pillar and support of the truth, the decisions made by the church are the truth. This verse says no such thing, however– it simply states that the church, the true collective of Christians that follow Christ and are known to Him, are the pillar and support of the truth. They do not receive the truth by being a part of the church, but are a part of the church because they have learned the truth and rejoice in it.

The Scriptures teach in Colossians 3:17 where the authority for the Christian lay:

Whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through Him to God the Father.

We are told further about where the authority for the Christian’s actions are in 2 Timothy 3:16-17:

All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.

These truths are further exemplified by the attitude of Luke toward the Bereans in Acts 17:11:

Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.

We have seen that the Scriptures have spoken: we must not do any action while on Earth unless it is done by the authority of the Lord Jesus. We read about His will and desire for us in the Scriptures, and we must examine the Scriptures to confirm the words that we shall hear.

Unfortunately, Christians are always in danger of following after either a “cult of personality” or a “collective determination.” Many times we will look back and consider certain preachers or such men from the past with high esteem and will use his words almost as if they are authoritative because that individual spoke them. Some may even do this with individuals yet living, believing that a preacher or an elder perhaps is such a great Christian that whatever he says must be true. I have seen many times that Christians believe that a practice is justifiable because the elders of their local congregation have approved the action and therefore it must be okay. It is also very possible for Christians to believe something to be true or to believe that a practice ought not be done because every other Christian in their local area believes it. Brethren, we must constantly make sure that we do not walk down the path of denominationalism by following after the beliefs of an individual or believing something because everyone else believes it– if we are going to believe that something is true and right in the sight of God, we must do so because we have searched the Scriptures to see if it is so, and that we may perform the action in confidence that it is done properly in the name of our Lord.

The weekend's event's kicked off on Friday night as the new inductees were joined by 15 returning Hall of Fame members for a meet and greet session in the museum. A second session took place Saturday morning. In total, close to 1,500 fans packed the museum for the two sessions. As the Saturday meet and greet session was underway, the second game day block party of the year featuring live music and refreshments was in full swing with thousands of fans gathering on the west side of the ballpark to enjoy the festivities. The loudest cheer from the crowd went to Sean Casey who made a brief appearance on stage to thank the fans for being there.

With the block party moving along at full tilt, ballpark gates opened and the sold out crowd filed in, the first 25,000 receiving a commemorative Sean Casey bobblehead. The capacity crowd was treated to the official induction of Casey, Driessen and Reilly in a pre-game ceremony during which Driessen and Casey addressed the crowd and received their Hall of Fame plaques.

The weekend was capped off by the Hall of Fame Induction Gala presented by cincyfavorites.com at the Duke Energy Convention Center. A sold-out audience of over 1,400 was treated to an elegant dinner and a memory and humor-filled program that brought the Reds past and present together like never before. Moving speeches from Driessen and Casey highlighted the evening which ended with the traditional red jacket presentation as the new inductees donned their jackets for the first time, surrounded by the other members of the Reds Hall of Fame fraternity.

The audience stood as one as the red-jacketed assemblage of Hall of Famers smiled and waved, acknowledging the cheers that celebrated not only the triumphant end to the Gala and the weekend but much more so, the accomplishments of the men in the red jackets who have brought so much joy to generations of Reds fans.

"The Art of Making Pickles

When Brian Crane (BA ’73) married Diana Long (BS ’73), she gave him the best possible dowry: her parents. Bud and Ardella Long, of Pocatello, Idaho, unintentionally became the models for Earl and Opal Pickles, the beloved stars of Crane’s nationally syndicated cartoon strip, Pickles.

“As I started drawing Pickles, I began to recognize my in-laws’ personalities in Earl and Opal,” Crane explains. “They bicker back and forth but are totally devoted to each other and depend on each other for their happiness. They are always doing things that find their way into the strip.”

His in-laws, for instance, once started wearing magnetic bracelets for their health, but whenever they ate, their silverware stuck to the bracelets. “It was hilarious and so typical,” Crane says. “Configurations of their magnetic adventure made it into 30 of my strips.”

Another incident took place at the Long’s cabin. Bud discovered he hadn’t brought along any shaving cream, so he lathered his face with toothpaste.

Opal: What were you doing in the bathroom for so long?

Earl: Shaving.

Opal: Is that a new aftershave you’re wearing?

Earl: No. I was out of shaving cream, so I used toothpaste instead.

Opal: Ah . . . That would explain why you smell so minty fresh.

Decent Folks

“I like his characters,” says Drabble cartoonist Kevin Fagan. “What I really like about Brian’s work is that he is funny and uplifting at the same time. You feel good about these characters. They are decent folks.”

In the foreword to the first of Crane’s five Pickles books, legendary Peanuts cartoonist Charles Schulz reflected the same sentiment: “I think it would be very comforting to have Earl and Opal for neighbors.” Schulz also correctly predicted the comic strip’s longevity.Pickles premiered in 1990 and 21 years later remains a popular feature nationwide.

According to Crane’s editor, Amy Lago of the Washington Post Writers Group, Pickles ranks in the top 10 in almost every market in which it appears and, more usually, in the top three, often coming in first. Pickles is found in nearly 800 markets, making it one of the most widely syndicated comic strips today.

An Impossible Dream

Crane’s success with the strip fulfills a childhood dream. He grew up reading and loving comic strips. His favorites were Al Capp’s Li’l Abner and Pogo by Walt Kelly. “They were really funny,” he says, “and as I got older, I liked them on a second level, where I could appreciate their brilliant political and social satire. I still think they are two of the greatest comic strips of all time.”

He cannot remember a time when he did not want to join their ranks. “I broke my arm when I was 12, and the doctor tried to distract me by asking me what I wanted to be when I grew up. The first answer out of my mouth was ‘comic strip artist,’ but even as I said it, it seemed like an impossible dream.”

Crane’s first drawings were for his own amusement, often funny faces drawn in the margins of his school papers. Around fifth grade, he showed a drawing to a friend who laughed so hard milk spurted from his nose. “That was probably the greatest single encouragement I ever got to pursue a career in cartooning,” Crane says.

Earl: The phone company called to say our payment was declined.

Opal: What?!

Earl: The credit card company closed my account. They say according to their records, I’m deceased.

Opal: Deceased? Really?

Earl: Yeah, can you believe that?

Opal: Well, you have to admit that’s an easy mistake to make.

Launching the Pickles Family

Crane’s fortunes began to change when a job creating greeting cards convinced him he had a talent for funny ideas. “I had never thought of myself as a writer,” Crane says, “but I actually enjoyed doing that as much or more than the artwork.”

That pleasure, and his growing disillusionment with doing ads for companies and products in which he didn’t believe, made Crane reconsider his old dream of cartooning.

“I was almost 40 and thought if I didn’t try now, I probably never would,” he says. Crane began to learn the process of getting syndicated by reading the autobiography of Mort Walker, known for the strip Beetle Bailey. As he read about making samples, sending submissions, trying to get a syndicate’s attention, and finding a market, he thought he would have better odds at the lottery. And he was right, says his editor. “The odds of being picked up for syndication are about 5,000 to 3,” Lago explains. “And being successful enough to make a nice living is like winning the Mega Millions.”

Crane decided to give it a shot anyway, since the cost would be nothing more than a little ink and paper. “I figured it was a better midlife option than buying a red Ferrari,” he says.

First he had to create his characters. “Trying to decide who I was going to write about was a major decision,” he says. “It’s not like writing a book with a set of characters you can leave behind after you’re finished. In a comic strip, you could be writing about these characters the rest of your life, so it’s important they have legs that can inspire you for a long time. I have always liked older people, because they remind me of grandparents. I drew an older lady and my personal lightbulb went on.”

The first characters were more crotchety than Opal and Earl have become, and he tried to find a name, like Crabtree, that would depict a cranky old couple. Nothing seemed right until he watched a football game in which one of the players had the last name of Pickles. Thus the Pickles family was born.

Crane sent samples of his cartoons to three major syndicates. The first rejected him. The second rejected him. “The third rejection really hurt his feelings,” says his wife, Diana, “because it felt so personal.”

“It wasn’t a case of the third time is a charm. It was three strikes, you’re out,” he says.

Crane was ready to abandon his dream, but his wife insisted he try again. “It’s really great to be married to someone who has more faith in your abilities than you do,” Crane says. “So I sent some examples to the Washington Post Writers Group.”

The syndicate liked his work and sent samples to newspaper contacts nationwide for evaluation. Then he waited.

“It takes considerable manpower to promote you, and there are many others from which to choose,” he says. “It’s a big commitment, and I wasn’t surprised when, after several months, I had not heard from the Washington Post group.”

When the call finally came telling him they wanted him to sign a contract, Crane felt a combination of euphoria and uncertainty. He asked himself, “Can I really do this? Do I have the ideas to do this for a month, let alone years and years? I think I was having the art world’s version of writer’s block, but I was smart enough to portray a confidence I didn’t really feel.”

Earl: So you’re saying that married men live about 10 years longer than unmarried men. . . . Therefore, in all likelihood I’d probably be dead now if it weren’t for you.

Opal: Correct.

Earl: Hmm.

Opal: I believe the phrase you’re searching for is “thank you.”

The Graying of America

Crane believes he found a niche for the graying of America, and the editors saw the marketing potential for it. He was cautioned not to quit his day job, however, and when he asked an editor how many papers would run his strip, she said probably about 50. That would get them enough return on their investment, but not enough to ensure his security. He took their advice. Crane would work all day at the advertising agency, have dinner with his family, and head to an improvised studio in his garage, where he worked on the strip for four hours. When Pickles reached 60 papers, he cut his day job down to four days a week, and five years later he became a cartoonist full-time.

Joining the ranks of professional cartoonists, Crane began meeting his new colleagues—at comic strip conventions and elsewhere. Among them was the late Charles Schulz.

“He was very encouraging to me,” says Crane. “He used to have a Christmas ice-skating show in Santa Rosa [California], and he always had one night just for cartoonists. . . . He was generous and seemed surprised by his success.”

“Brian is a gentle guy and very quiet,” says Schulz’ widow, Jean, who runs the Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center in Santa Rosa. Crane often loans original strips to the museum, and he has taught master classes and served as a cartoonist-in-residence at the center. “He does not possess a huge ego,” says Jean Schulz, “something that often happens with artists who become as successful as Brian.”

Crane, born among the first wave of baby boomers, is also starting to get insights from the man in the mirror. “I inspire myself a lot, including a day I walked my dog in the park. After some time, I looked down and noticed I was holding an empty leash. My dog had slipped out of her collar without me noticing and was off sniffing a tree somewhere. Meanwhile, I was greeting others and holding an empty leash. People must have thought I was crackers.”

Every morning Crane awakes ready to live his dream. He does not always know what the day will bring, but more than two decades of strips give him the confidence that his next idea is about to emerge. “I hope I can do this until I die,” he says. “I’m still pinching myself after 20 years. I would like nothing better than someday dropping dead into a bottle of ink.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"I finished season three of Breaking Bad last night. Chris, I certainly wanted it to keep going and resolve some stuff, but I'm okay with waiting. I was still engaged through the season as a whole. Now I'm onto Mad Men.

I just watched the BD version of FOTR. My overall impression was that it looked pretty good and noticeably better than the DVD version in some scenes. In the scenes I’ve demoed a lot I could tell that the audio was remixed so the voices weren’t drowned out by the music however, there were still several scenes where that still happened. There were only a couple scenes that looked abnormally blue mainly in the snow and in a few dark scenes. But otherwise it wasn’t distracting even though I was looking for it. OTOH the image sharpness seemed very inconsistent. Some scenes look crystal clear while the next one might look a little soft or hazy. IMO this was far more noticeable than any blue tinting. I felt it was downright distracting at times.

Afterwards I popped the DVD version in my other Oppo and chaptered through doing an A/B comparison. For picture quality there is no comparison, the BD strikingly superior in every way both on my 134” screen and 46” HDTV, more noticeable on the screen of course. OTOH I didn’t notice nearly the same improvement in the audio quality. LFE and surround sound seemed the same. As I already noted there were some scenes where the music was toned down a bit on the BD version so that it didn’t overpower everything else but there were still a few places where it did.

So based on what I saw and heard I would certainly upgrade for the picture quality alone but don’t do it if you’re looking only for a better audio experience.

I've only watched select scenes from Fellowship so far, but they were enough to remind me how much the movies annoy me. I think I'm regretting my purchase. Ha ha.

I finished season 4 of Mad Men. There sure are some compelling TV series these days. It's getting harder and harder to sit through movies when it feels so much more rewarding to watch shows that have the opportunity to develop the characters that much more.

I can't remember what show I was going to work on next. Hmm....

I got my friend to start watching Friday Night Lights and Curb Your Enthusiasm with me, so it will be nice to revisit those. It's nice to be able to alternate between Larry David being a dork and the amped up drama of Friday Night Lights.

I watched ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"" last night. I was very impressed with the quality of this movie. The reviews had said that this movie had the best quality ever seen in both video and audio. I was a little reluctant to buy it because others had said that the story sucked, but I disagree. The story wasn't bad at all. I got this movie yesterday for $9.66 after store discount and using $10 worth of BB rewards coupons.

I saw that ""Falling Skies"" was on after ""Leverage"". I didn't check it out yet, but I'll give it a shot and report back.

EDIT: I'll tack on here. Has any anime fan watched either The Girl Who Leapt through Time, or Summer Wars? I'm thinking about give each of them a rent.

I've watched both and like them both. The Girl Who Leapt through Time is funny at the beginning but a little bit sad in the end while Summer Wars is about family and love. Neither of them is for children. Highly recommended if you like Japanese anime.

Talking about animes, I used to love them when I was younger but then haven't watched any in like 10 years. So a couple of weeks ago I decided to look on the net for a few recommendations. I ended up buying Evangelion 1.11 and Afro Samurai. I watched both this weekend. I really liked Afro Samurai. I's a 5 episodes movie that lasts about 2 hours. The story is very good with the development of both the main character and the plot so are the video and audio. As for Evangelion, I was expecting more. While the Video and Audio are top notch (a little more LFE wouldn't hurt), I found the story a bit confusing and not that rich. Given that I am not familiar with the older show, I might not understand everything and it seems that the whole story will be developed throughout 5 movies. I will most definitely buy Afro Samurai Resurrection and will probably download Evangelion 2.22 before buying it. Another that I just bought on Ebay is Paprika, supposedly a good scifi anime, I'll let you know.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Of course I know FlashOS - who doesn't? It's great and I guess that we will not get close to what you have already accomplished. I already wondered when you would release the MX version of it. I'm looking forward to see how you solved certain things...

Finally got the new gskinner.com site up (though missing a lot of content). Has some limited info on FlashOS2, including some early screen shots, descriptions, and an older entity map. The new site is actually built in FlashOS2 - though it only uses a few of it's resources.

I'll also be open-sourcing a lot of FlashOS1 (much to my own embarassment - it's not the best code on earth) in the near future, along with some of my other past projects.

btw: your site isn't displaying properly today in IE5.2 for MacOS10.2. Can send you a screen grab if you'd like.

"Norm Solomon on the Green Party’s Presidential Campaign

The 2004 Presidential Race: Green Dreams

The Green Party and the ’04 Presidential Campaign

The Green Party makes no secret that it is different and radical: a multi-decade effort to bring justice and fairness into politics and into every facet of society. Norm Solomon simply won’t admit that the Green Party is unique, growing in a new paradigm that the old decaying parties refuse to acknowledge — and missing out on this truth leads Solomon to make mistakes in his views about the Greens.

by Norman Solomon

Activists have plenty of good reasons to challenge the liberal Democratic Party operatives who focus on election strategy while routinely betraying progressive ideals. Unfortunately, the national Green Party now shows appreciable signs of the flip side — focusing on admirable ideals without plausible strategy. Running Ralph Nader for president is on the verge of becoming a kind of habitual crutch — used even when the effect is more damaging than helpful.

The Progress Report — Ralph Nader has run for president less often than Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr., or Richard Nixon. So what? Is there a rule that says Nader is not allowed to run?

It’s impossible to know whether the vote margin between Bush and his Democratic challenger will be narrow or wide in November 2004. I’ve never heard a credible argument that a Nader campaign might help to defeat Bush next year. A Nader campaign might have no significant effect on Bush’s chances — or it could turn out to help Bush win. With so much at stake, do we really want to roll the dice this way?

The Progress Report — Who is this “we” that is rolling the dice? Each political party nominates a candidate for president. That’s their business. If you want to participate, join a party and be active.

We’re told that another Nader campaign will help to build the Green Party. But Nader’s prospects of coming near his nationwide 2000 vote total of 2.8 million are very slim; much more probable is that a 2004 campaign would win far fewer votes — hardly an indicator of, or contributor to, a growing national party.

The Progress Report — That is a reasonable point against nominating Nader, and Green Party members are taking it into consideration. Nader is not currently a Green Party member, and his selection as that party’s nominee for president is not at all certain.

It appears to me that the entire project of running a Green presidential candidate in 2004 is counter-productive. Some faithful will be energized, with a number of predictably uplifting “super rallies” along the way, but many past and potential Green voters are likely to consciously drift away. Such a campaign will generate much alienation and bitterness from natural constituencies. Ironically, the current Green party-building agenda looks like a scenario for actually damaging the party.

The Progress Report — How does Norm Solomon reach this conclusion? He does not say.

Green organizers often insist that another presidential run is necessary so that the party can energize itself and stay on the ballot in various states. But it would be much better to find other ways to retain ballot access while running stronger Green campaigns in selected local races. Overall, I don’t believe that a Green Party presidential campaign in 2004 will help build a viable political alternative from below.

Some activists contend that the Greens will maintain leverage over the Democratic Party by conveying a firm intention to run a presidential candidate. I think that’s basically an illusion. The prospect of a Green presidential campaign is having very little effect on the Democratic nomination contest, and there’s no reason to expect that to change. The Democrats are almost certain to nominate a “moderate” corporate flack (in which category Howard Dean should be included).

A few years ago, Nader and some others articulated the theory that throwing a scare into the Democrats would move them in a more progressive direction. That theory was disproved after November 2000. As a whole, congressional Democrats have not become more progressive since then.

The Progress Report — True, the Democrats have not indicated that they have learned much of anything from the 2000 or the 2002 elections. That is a rather telling point against the Democrats, not the Greens.

There has been a disturbing tendency among some Greens to conflate the Democratic and Republican parties. Yes, the agendas of the two major parties overlap. But they also diverge. And in some important respects, any of the Democratic presidential contenders would be clearly better than Bush (with the exception of Joseph Lieberman, whose nomination appears to be quite unlikely). For the left to be “above the fray” would be a big mistake. It should be a matter of great concern — not indifference or mild interest — as to whether the Bush gang returns to power for four more years.

I’m not suggesting that progressives mute their voices about issues. The imperative remains to keep speaking out and organizing. As Martin Luther King Jr. said on April 30, 1967: “When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, militarism and economic exploitation are incapable of being conquered.” The left should continue to denounce all destructive policies and proposals, whether being promoted by Republicans or Democrats.

At the same time, we should not gloss over the reality that the Bush team has neared some elements of fascism in its day-to-day operations — and forces inside the Bush administration would be well-positioned to move it even farther to the right after 2004. We don’t want to find out how fascistic a second term of George W. Bush’s presidency could become. The current dire circumstances should bring us up short and cause us to re-evaluate approaches to ’04. The left has a responsibility to contribute toward a broad coalition to defeat Bush next year.

The Progress Report — This talk about “right versus left” merely serves to divide people when they should be united. The old right-left distinction ceased to be meaningful long ago. As the Green Party of Ontario says, “Rather than Left-Right, the new axis can be described as a green-grey spectrum. Green values include decentralization, sustainability, community-control, and diversity, while grey values are centralization, unsustainable industrial processes, trans- national control, and monoculture.”

There are some Green Party proposals for a “safe states” strategy, with the party’s presidential nominee concentrating on states that seem sure to go for either Bush or the Democrat. But it’s not always clear whether a state is “safe” (for instance, how about California?). And the very act of a Green campaign focusing on some “safe states” might render a few of those states more susceptible to a Bush upset win. An additional factor is that presidential campaigns are largely nationwide.

In 2000, despite unfair exclusion from the debates and the vast majority of campaign news coverage, Nader did appear on national radio and TV to a significant extent. And of course, more than ever, the Internet is teeming with progressive websites, listservs and e-mail forwarding. It doesn’t seem very practical to run as a national candidate while effectively urging people in some states not to vote for you when they see your name on the ballot — even if the candidate is inclined toward such a strategy. And that’s a big “if.”

For all its talk of democratic accountability, the Green Party is hooked into the old-fashioned notion that a candidate, once nominated, decides how and where to campaign. It’s ironic that the party is likely to end up with a presidential candidate who will conduct the campaign exactly as he chooses, with no built-in post-nomination accountability to any constituency or group decision-making. Kind of sounds like the major parties in that respect; choose the candidate and the candidate does whatever he wants from that point forward.

The Progress Report — Whether Norm Solomon likes it or not, candidates’ campaigns are not mere puppets controlled by a centralized party.

We concur that the “safe states” strategy is a pack of nonsense — no political party should have to tie itself in knots just to be seen as nice by other political parties. Why should the Green Party cut down its own campaigns just to help the Democrats? Remember, please — the Democrats in New Mexico attempted to ban the Green Party. The Democrats in Maine attampted to ban the Green Party. You can’t get much less friendly than that. What national Democrats have deplored those attempts?

No doubt, too many Democratic Party officials have been arrogant toward Green Party supporters. “Democrats have to face reality and understand that if they move too far to the right, millions of voters will defect or vote for third-party candidates,” Tom Hayden pointed out in a recent article . “Democrats have to swallow hard and accept the right of the Green Party and Ralph Nader to exist and compete.” At the same time, Hayden added cogently, “Nader and the Greens need a reality check. The notion that the two major parties are somehow identical may be a rationale for building a third party, but it insults the intelligence of millions of blacks, Latinos, women, gays, environmentalists and trade unionists who can’t afford the indulgence of Republican rule.”

The Progress Report — Norm Solomon cannot have it both ways. Sometimes he indicates that the Green Party is a trivial band of naive idealists, but at other times he implies that it has terrific power to determine the outcome of the 2004 election. Let’s be consistent, shall we?

The presidency of George W. Bush is not a garden-variety Republican administration. By unleashing its policies in this country and elsewhere in the world, the Bush gang has greatly raised the stakes of the next election. The incumbent regime’s blend of extreme militarism and repressive domestic policy should cause the left to take responsibility for helping to oust this far-right administration — rather than deferring to dubious scenarios for Green party-building.

The Progress Report — Again with this left-right trap. Greens have said it a thousand times — the Green Party is neither left nor right, but out in front. Norm Solomon’s descriptions and criticisms are off the mark, because the Greens do not fit into his left-right paradigm. Greens have recognized the new paradigm where “grey versus green” makes sense, not “left versus right.” When Norm Solomon finally gets his hands around this concept (and he will), his remarks will be sharper and clearer.

In an August essay, Michael Albert of Z Magazine wrote: “One post election result we want is Bush retired. However bad his replacement may turn out, replacing Bush will improve the subsequent mood of the world and its prospects of survival. Bush represents not the whole ruling class and political elite, but a pretty small sector of it. That sector, however, is trying to reorder events so that the world is run as a U.S. empire, and so that social programs and relations that have been won over the past century in the U.S. are rolled back as well. What these parallel international and domestic aims have in common is to further enrich and empower the already super rich and super powerful.”

Albert pointed out some of the foreseeable consequences of another Bush term: “Seeking international Empire means war and more war — or at least violent coercion. Seeking domestic redistribution upward of wealth and power, most likely means assaulting the economy via cutbacks and deficits, and then entreating the public that the only way to restore functionality is to terminate government programs that serve sectors other than the rich, cutting health care, social services, education, etc.” And Albert added: “These twin scenarios will not be pursued so violently or aggressively by Democrats due to their historic constituency. More, the mere removal of Bush will mark a step toward their reversal.”

Looking past the election, Albert is also on target: “We want to have whatever administration is in power after Election Day saddled by a fired up movement of opposition that is not content with merely slowing Armageddon, but that instead seeks innovative and aggressive social gains. We want a post election movement to have more awareness, more hope, more infrastructure, and better organization by virtue of the approach it takes to the election process.”

I’m skeptical that the Green Party’s leadership is open to rigorously pursue a thoroughgoing safe-states approach along the lines that Albert has suggested in his essay . Few of the prominent Green organizers seem sufficiently flexible. For instance, one Green Party leader who advocates “a Strategic States Plan” for 2004 has gone only so far as to say that “most” of the party’s resources should be focused on states “where the Electoral College votes are not ‘in play.’” Generally the proposals coming from inside the Green Party seem equivocal, indicating that most party leaders are unwilling to really let go of traditional notions of running a national presidential campaign.

I’m a green. But these days, in the battle for the presidency, I’m not a Green.

The Progress Report — Sorry, Norm Solomon, you are not a green or a Green, because you insist on seeing Greens as just a bunch of forward-thinking sincere Democrats. You need to open up a new space in your mind where the Greens fit. It is not convenient nor easy to do this, but more and more Americans are doing it each day.

Here in the United States, the Green Party is dealing with an electoral structure that’s very different from the parliamentary systems that have provided fertile ground for Green parties in Europe. We’re up against the winner-take-all U.S. electoral system. Yes, there are efforts to implement “instant runoff voting,” but those efforts will not transform the electoral landscape in this decade. And we should focus on this decade precisely because it will lead the way to the next ones.

By now it’s an open secret that Ralph Nader is almost certain to run for president again next year. Nader has been a brilliant and inspirational progressive for several decades. I supported his presidential campaigns in 1996 and 2000. I won’t in 2004. The reasons are not about the past but about the future.

We are Hanno Beck, Lindy Davies, Fred Foldvary, Mike O'Mara, Jeff Smith, and assorted volunteers, all dedicated to bringing you the news and views that make a difference in our species struggle to win justice, prosperity, and eco-librium.

I think that Ralph Nader should run again. I mean there’s a chance that it might take away votes from the democratic party and give more to George Bush. But even the democrats have taken actions against the greens. Norm Solomon shouldn’t think of greens as naive, he is not a green, so he should just accept the greens as not being just another democratic party but a party of their own.

Solomon is right. We can’t afford a Bush victory in 2004. There is a time for plurality, and there is a time for concensus. If Bush wins the next election, all HELL is liable to break loose before 2008. It is imperative that we (and here Fred, I am referring to moderates, liberals, and progressives alike) temporarily abandon our differences, and unite to GET BUSH OUT OF POWER.

If we don’t, we and the whole rest of the world are in for big trouble. The leaders of the Green Party know this, or at least they should know it. I don’t see how they can in good conscience run a candidate in competition with Bush’s opposition, no matter how unsatisfactory that opposition might be.

The Greens are long on ideals, and short on strategy. Good strategy for them at this point, would be to endorse wholeheartedly the Democrats’ Kucinich; to publicly avail Kucinich of all the Greens’ considerable resources of PR and enthusiasm. To make a Kucinich nomination the condition for Green support of the Democrats. This would put both Kucinich AND the Greens in the media spotlight, which is exactly where they both need to be. Also, it would exert considerable pressure on the Democratic nominating process.

Then, even if Kucinich loses the nomination to Dean or Kerry (which he probably would), a broad and ideologically cogent coalition will have been formed. And the Greens would still be free to, at the last moment, urge their supporters to vote for WHOEVER is opposing George Bush.

I like your call for unity and consensus. You remark that the Greens don’t seem to be very interested in that, but my question is, are the Democrats? The Democrats have a much larger political party, and so far, there has been no “unity” talk emanating from them to the Greens — instead there has been continued scolding, threats, inaction on issues such as instant runoff voting, and — worst of all — attempts to ban the Green Party outright.

Dennis Kucinich is the best member of Congress and the best of the announced Democratic candidates for president. It would be very reasonable for Green Party members to support his campaign, except for one thing. The Green Party is a political party, not a pressure group. Can you name some occasions when the Democratic Party officially endorsed a non-Democrat? Or when the Republican Party officially endorsed a non-Republican? Each of those parties has had more than 100 years to set such precedents. But, whether we like it or not, the business of a political party is to promote its own candidates. If the Green Party has the right to exist at all, then it has the right to nominate a Green for president. More than a right, in fact — an obligation, to its own members and to the future of the world.

If the Democrats want a different arrangement, they’d better change their behavior and sit down at the bargaining table. But I don’t expect that.

Geonomics is …

a POV that Spain’s president might try. A few blocks from my room in Madrid at a book fair to promote literacy, Sr Zapatero, while giving autographs and high fives to kids, said books are very expensive and he’d see about getting the value added tax on them cut down to zero. (El Pais, June 4; see, politicians can grasp geo-logic.) But why do we raise the cost of any useful product? Why not tax useless products? Even more basic: is being better than a costly tax good enough? Our favorite replacement for any tax is no tax: instead, run government like a business and charge full market value for the permits it issues, such as everything from corporate charters to emission allowances to resource leases. These pieces of paper are immensely valuable, yet now our steward, the state, gives them away for nearly free, absolutely free in some cases. Government is sitting on its own assets and needs merely to cash in by doing what any rational entity in the economy does – negotiate the best deal. Then with this profit, rather than fund more waste, pay the stakeholders, we citizenry, a dividend. Thereby geonomics gets rid of two huge problems. It replaces taxes with full-value fees and replaces subsidies for special interests with a Citizens Dividend for people in general. Neither left nor right, this reform is what both nature lovers and liberty lovers need to promote, right now.

shaped by reality. In the 1980′s, the Swedish government doubled its stock transfer tax. Tax receipts, however, rose only 15%, since traders simply fled to London exchanges. Fearing a further exodus, the Swedish government quickly rescinded the tax altogether. (The New York Times, April 20) That willingness to tax anything leads us astray. Pushing us astray is that unwillingness to pay what we owe: rent for land, our common heritage. Assuming land value is up for grabs, we speculate. We cap the property tax on both land and buildings and the rate at which assessments can go up; while real market values rise quicker, assessments can never catch up. Our stewards, the Bureau of Land Management, routinely sell and lease sites below market value, often to insiders, says the Government Accounting Office. Once we grasp that rent is ours to share, we’ll collect it all, rather than let it enrich a few, and quit taxing earnings, which do belong to the individual earner. That shift is geonomic policy.

the study of the money we spend on the nature we use. When we pay that money to private owners, we reward both speculation and over-extraction. Robert Kiyosaki’s bestseller, Rich Dad’s Prophecy, says, “One of the reasons McDonald’s is such a rich company is not because it sells a lot of burgers but because it owns the land at some of the best intersections in the world. The main reason Kim and I invest in such properties is to own the land at the corner of the intersection. (p 200) My real estate advisor states that the rich either made their money in real estate or hold their money in real estate.” (p 141, via Greg Young) When government recovers the rents for natural advantages for everyone, it can save citizens millions. Ben Sevack, Montreal steel manufacturer, tells us (August 12) that Alberta, by leasing oil & gas fields, recovers enough revenue to be the only province in Canada to get by without a sales tax and to levy a flat provincial income tax. While running for re-election, provincial Premier Ralph Klein proposes to abolish their income tax and promises to eliminate medical insurance premiums and use resource revenue to pay for all medical expense for seniors. After all this planned tax-cutting and greater expense, they still expect a large budget surplus. Even places without oil and gas have high site values in their downtowns, and high values in their utility franchises. Recover the values of locations and privileges, displace the harmful taxes on sales, salaries, and structures, then use the revenue to fund basic government and pay residents a dividend, and you have geonomics in action.

close to the policy of the Garden Cities in England. Founded by Ebenezer Howard over a century ago, residents own the land in common and run the town as a business. Letchworth, the oldest of the model towns, serves residents grandly from bucketfuls of collected land rent (as does the Canadian Province of Alberta from oil royalty). A geonomic town would pay the rent to residents, letting them freely choose personalized services, and also ax taxes. Both geonomics and Howard were inspired by American proto-geonomist Henry George. The movement launched by Howard today in the UK advances the shift of taxes from buildings to locations. A recent report from the Town and Country Planning Association proposes this Property Tax Shift and their journal published research in the potential of land value taxation by Tony Vickers (Vol. 69, Part 5, 2000). (Thanks to James Robertson)

a new field of study offered in place of economics, as astronomy replaced astrology and chemistry replaced alchemy. Conventional economics, in which GNP can do well while people suffer, is a bit too superstitious for my renaissance upbringing. If I’m to propitiate unseen forces, it won’t be inflation or “the market”; let it be theEgyptian cat goddess. At least then we’d have fewer rats. Meanwhile, believing in reason leads to a new policy, also christened geonomics. That’s the proposal to share (a kind of management, the “nomics” part) the worth of Mother Earth (the “geo” part). If our economies are to work right, people need to see prices that tell the truth. Now taxes and subsidies distort prices, tricking people into squandering the planet. Using land dues and rent dividends instead lets prices be precise, guiding people to get more from less and thereby shrink their workweek. More free time ought to make us happy enough to evolve beyond economics, except when nostalgic for superstition.

of interest to Dave Lakhani, President Bold Approach (Mar 8) and Matt Ozga (Jan 29): “I write for the Washington Square News, the student run newspaper out of New York University. Geonomics seems like it has great significance, especially in this area. When was geonomics developed, and by whom?”
About 1982 I began. Two years later, Chilean Dr Manfred Max-Neef offered the term geonomics for Earth-friendly economics. In the mid-80s, a millionaire founded a Geonomics Institute on Middlebury College campus in Vermont re global trade. In the 1990s, CNBC cablecast a show, Geonomics, on world trade as it benefits world traders. My version of geonomics draws heavily from the American Henry George who wrote Progress & Poverty (1879) and won the mayoralty of New York but was denied his victory by Tammany Hall (1886). He in turn got lots from Brits David Ricardo, Adam Smith, and the French physiocrats of the 1700s. My version differs by focusing not on taxation but on the flow of rents for sites, resources, sinks, and government-granted privileges. Forgoing these trillions, we instead tax and subsidize, making waste cheap and sustainability expensive. To quit distorting price, replace taxes with “land dues” and replace subsidies with a Citizens Dividend.
Matt: “This idea of sharing rents sounds, if not explicitly socialist, at least at odds with some capitalist values (only the strong survive & prosper, etc). Is it fair to say that geonomics has some basis in socialist theory?”
A closer descriptor would be Christian. Beyond ethics into praxis, Alaska shares oil rent with residents, and they’re more libertarian than socialist. While individuals provide labor and capital, no one provides land while society generates its value. Rent is not private property but public property. Sharing Rent is predistribution, sharing it before an elite or state has a chance to get and misspend it, like a public REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) paying dividends to its stakeholders – a perfectly capitalist model. What we should leave untaxed are our sales, salaries, and structures, things we do produce.

more transformation than reform; it’s a step ahead. Harvard economics students this year did petition to change the curriculum, in the wake of the English who caught the dissension from across The Channel. French reformers, who fault conventional economics for conjuring mathematical models of little empirical relevance and being closed to critical and reflective thought, reject this “autism” – or detachment from reality – and dub their offering “post-autistic economics”. Not a bad name, but again, academics define themselves by what they’re not, not by what they are, unlike geonomists. We track rent – the money we spend on the nature we use – and watch it pull all the other economic indicators in its wake. We see economies as part and parcel of the ecosystem, similarly following natural patterns and able to self-regulate more so than allowed, once we quit distorting prices. To align people and planet, we’d replace taxes and subsidies with recovering and sharing rents.

an economic policy based on the earth’s natural patterns. Eco-systems self-regulate by using feedback loops to keep balance. Can economies do likewise? Why don’t they now produce efficiently and distribute fairly? The answers lie in the money we spend on the earth we use. To attain people/planet harmony, that financial flow from sites and resources must visit each of us. Our agent, government, must collect this natural rent via fees and disburse the collected revenue via dividends. And, it must forgo taxes on homes and earnings, and quit subsidies of either the needy or the greedy. As our steward, government must also collect Ecology Security Deposits, require Restoration Insurance, and auction off the occasional Emissions Permit. And that’s about it – were nature our model.

a manual. The world did not come without a way for people to prosper, and the planet to heal and stay well; that way is geonomics. Economies are part of the ecosystem. Both generate surpluses and follow self-regulating feedback loops. A cycle like the Law of Supply and Demand is one of the economy’s on/off loops. Our spending for land and resources – things that nobody made and everybody needs – constitutes our society’s surplus. Those profits without production (remember, nobody produced Earth) can become our commonwealth. To share it, we could pay land dues in to the public treasury (wouldn’t oil companies love that?) and get rent dividends back, a la Alaska’s oil dividend. Doing so let’s us axe taxes and jettison subsidies. Taxes and subsidies distort price (the DNA of exchange), violate quid pro quo by benefiting the well-connected more than anyone else, reinforce hierarchy of state over citizen, and are costly to administer (you don’t really need so much bureaucracy, do you?). Conversely, land dues motivate people to not waste sites, resources, and the ecosystem while rent dividends motivate people to not waste themselves. Receiving this income supplement – a Citizens Dividend – people can invest in their favorite technology or outgrow being “economan” and shrink their overbearing workweek in order to enjoy more time with family, friends, community, and nature. Then in all that free time, maybe we could figure out just what we are here for.

a discipline that, compared to economics, is as obscure as Warren Buffett’s investment strategy, compared to conventional investment theory, about which Buffett said, “You couldn’t advance in a finance department in this country unless you taught that the world was flat.” (The New York Times, Oct 29). The writer wondered, “But why? If it works, why don’t more investors use it?”
Good question. Geonomics works, too. Every place that has used it has prospered while conserving resources. Yet it remains off the radar of many wanna-be reformers. Gradually, tho’, that’s changing. More are becoming aware of what geonomics studies – all the money we spend on the nature we use. Geonomics (1) as an alternative worldview to the anthropocentric, sees human economies as part of the embracing ecosystem with natural feedback loops seeking balance in both systems. (2) As an alternative to worker vs. investor, it sees our need for sites and resources making those who own land into landlords. (3)As an alternative to economics, it tracks the trillions of “rent” as it drives the “housing” bubble and all other indicators. And (4) as an alternative to left or right, it suggests we not tax ourselves then subsidize our favorites but recover and share society’s surplus, paying in land dues and getting back “rent” dividends, a la Alaska’s oil dividend. Letting rent go to the wrong pockets wreaks havoc, while redirecting it to everyone would solve our economic ills and the ills downstream from them.
People must learn to stop whining so much and feel enough self-esteem to demand a fair share of rent, society’s surplus, the commonwealth.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Tag: Prince Harry

Two years of marriage in and the rest of a lifetime to go for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry.

The famous pair officially rang in their second wedding anniversary on Wednesday while fans recalled their world-famous nuptials inside St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle on that picturesque day in May 2018.

And, as royal enthusiasts well know, a lot has happened since the two officially tied the knot and became husband and wife, notably their first child, Archie Harrison, and more recently, their headline-making exit from life as senior royals.

The family of three has since relocated to Calif., reportedly staying in a mansion owned by Tyler Perry. While it’s unclear whether they’re guests or renting the property for the time-being, the two have been keeping a low profile in recent months—particularly after retiring their @SussexRoyal Instagram account in late March—save for occasional glimpses of their ongoing virtual work with their patronages and charitable endeavors.

Considering the nature of life right now amid the coronavirus pandemic, it’s no surprise the couple kept their anniversary celebrations fuss-free.

“They are just powering down,” a royal insider told E! News. “No calls, no Zoom meetings, no work. Just hanging out as a family. Keeping things simple.”

However, that doesn’t mean their anniversary went without gifts.

“They generally follow traditional anniversary gift giving,” a source shared. “The second year is cotton and they each put their own spin on it. They are very thoughtful and romantic gift givers.”

Cotton material is said to symbolize both comfort and strength and inspires the metaphor of married pairs becoming more woven together over time.

The couple commemorated their first wedding anniversary publicly last year by sharing never-before-seen photos of their milestone day.

“Thank you for all of the love and support from so many of you around the world,” they said in a joint statement on Instagram at the time. “Each of you made this day even more meaningful.”

Prince William and Kate Middleton change their names on social media accounts – and it's praised by fans

“This year, they both gave each other gifts based on cotton,” the insider told People.

“Undoubtedly, it was a very creative and romantic gesture as all their gifts are to one another.

“They love to do their own take on traditional wedding gifts,” the insider added.

Archie's best moments as Prince Harry and Meghan celebrate his first birthday

“The first anniversary was paper, and Meghan wrote out the wedding speech and had it framed for him.”

According to wedding lifestyle website The Knot, cotton represents how close and interconnected a married couple will be in the beginning of their marriage and demonstrates how husbands and wives can become more flexible as they grow.

Paper, meanwhile, represents the fragile beginnings of a marriage, but, if protected, can survive for “a lifetime”.

It comes after reports that the couple are living in a £14.5million home owned by producer and actor Tyler Perry in Los Angeles.

The eight bedroom house in Beverly Hills is owned by Diary Of A Mad Black Woman star Tyler Perry and is believed to cost $18million.

Although Harry and Meghan have never been seen with Tyler, they are thought to have connected with him through their mutual friend Oprah Winfrey.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have just marked their second wedding anniversary and if last year is anything to go by, Prince Harry was in for a sweet surprise from wife Meghan.

Much was said last year about Harry’s gift to his wife – an eternity ring – but Meghan’s gift was kept a secret, until now.

Prince Harry and Meghan celebrated their second wedding anniversary in Los Angeles

According to PEOPLE, Meghan, who has impeccable handwriting and was once a freelance calligrapher, wrote out their wedding speech and framed it for Harry – what a way to mark their paper wedding anniversary!

Last year was definitely an anniversary to remember, not only was it their first but just weeks before they had welcomed their first child into the world – Archie Harrison.

To mark his birth and their anniversary, Harry gifted Meghan an eternity ring, which she first wore when introducing their son to the world in Windsor Castle.

The couple introduced their first child to the world weeks before their first anniversary

New mum Meghan wore her sparkling accessory next to her Welsh gold wedding band and her three-stone diamond engagement ring.

Eternity rings symbolize everlasting love and are usually given by a spouse to their wife to commemorate a milestone wedding anniversary or to celebrate the welcoming of a new child. The ring is also typically covered in diamonds in an infinite loop around the band.

This year, the pair celebrated their seconf wedding anniversary in Los Angeles, where they are self-isolating with Archie since moving there from Canada in mid-March. The couple are residing at a £15million mansion owned by Tyler Perry in the Beverly Ridge Estate of LA and have been given small sneak peek’s inside.

Most recently, Harry and Meghan showed off one of the mansion’s rooms during a video call with the Crisis Text Line team. Attendee Ricky Neil shared a picture on Instagram of the call and it showed Meghan and Harry sitting next to each other with two large black lamps visible from behind. A large painting could also be seen, as well as wooden panelling on the walls.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are thought to be living in luxury inside the Beverly Hills mega-mansion owned by film tycoon Tyler Perry.

It was reported recently that the couple, who relocated to Los Angeles when they stepped down from senior royal duties, have been staying in the Tuscan-style villa that is worth £14.7m ($18m).

Along with eight bedrooms and 12 bathrooms, a glimpse inside the lavish abode provided by the film studio owner's Instagram page reveals that Harry and Meghan could be enjoying such features like a sunken bath, a separate chapel, a nursery and the sweeping views of the LA skyline.

Tyler's property sits within a 22-acre plot of land in the ultra-exclusive Beverly Ridge Estates guard-gated community.

And scrolling back through the 50-year-old's feed reveals an incredible insight into the sprawling home that Meghan, 38, and Harry, 35, may possibly have been staying during the coronavirus lockdown.

Back in 2016 when celebrating his son Aman's christening, Tyler welcomed famous faces including his pal Oprah who is his son's godmother, to his specially built chapel.

The ceremony took place inside the building which sits within the 22 acres of his property and is a replica of a church his mother attended as a child.

As well as that, there's an enormous pool which has stunning views of the city and surrounding hills. There's also plenty of space to host a soiree with restaurant style seating and umbrellas to protect guests from the LA sunshine.

In another snap of the view, Tyler shared a picture from a terrace area he calls the ""back deck"" in 2013 of storm clouds gathered above.

In the same year, the film studio owner also proved he had taste when it came to bathing in style, as he took a dip in a sunken bath.

Situated in the middle of one of the 12 bathrooms the circular basin sits in the middle with a huge chandelier hanging above.

There's also a nursery elsewhere in the property, that could be perfect as Archie's room, as it was once set up for Tyler's now 5-year-old son Aman who he shares with wife Gelila Bekele.

Tyler proudly posted about his back garden which was overflowing with flowers and greenery, overlooking LA.

And there's more than space to take his dogs on a long walk without ever leaving the property, which proves perfect for Meghan who has her two pet pooches.

Despite being in lockdown there would be plenty of space to hold a party, as Tyler proved when he invited several of his famous friends round to celebrate his 45th birthday – and had Stevie Wonder play at his piano in his living room.

Meanwhile the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have the option of several cosy nooks in Tyler's property, including a spacious room where the Diary Of A Mad Black Woman star puts up his Christmas tree.

There's the huge kitchen with a centre island that would be the ideal spot for Meghan and Harry to whip up some family dinners.

Especially as it goes largely unused by Tyler, who confessed he needed some cooking lessons when it came to making Thanksgiving dinner.

And when Meghan and Harry are making phone calls as part of their remaining duties to raise spirits during the COVID-19 pandemic, there's a study for them which boasts incredible mahogany furniture and comfy leather chairs.

Although Harry and Meghan have never been seen with Tyler and they have not confirmed they are living there, they are thought to have connected with him through their mutual friend Oprah Winfrey.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have been secretly volunteering at L.A. based charity Project Angel Food. Here’s how they’re helping the city’s most vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Wednesday, April 15, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stepped out to deliver meals — and a smile — to some Los Angeles residents living with critical illnesses. But it wasn’t the first time they’ve volunteered at Project Angel Food, a non-profit charity that cooks, prepares and delivers meals to people in need.

“The Duke and Duchess wanted to be of service on Easter, and they decided to volunteer at Project Angel Food and give our drivers a break that day,” Richard Ayoub, Project Angel Food’s executive director, told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “They loved the experience so much that they came back on Wednesday, and did more deliveries.”

“I think their whole goal was to be of service,” Richard explained to HL. “That was their main goal, their secondary goal was to relieve our drivers of some of their workload, because our drivers delivered to 50 to 60, people a day. Ant their third goal was to hopefully give someone a smile.”

Richard, who was there to give Meghan and Harry the tour, called the couple “totally down to earth” and told HL that it was all a big surprise. “It was very surprising and really pretty spectacular that this is the first organization, not only in L.A., but in the United States, that they wanted to work with, and that happened to be Project Angel Food.”

“I greeted them on Easter Sunday. It’s the best Easter Sunday I’ve ever had. And I gave them a tour of the kitchen. And they talked to our chefs. And they were very, very highly engaged. They asked questions, they asked about the meal production, about the medically tailored meals, about how many we do a week, who are the clients, and what are they going through. And then they talked to chefs and asked the chefs how long they had worked with us. They were really spectacular.”

“One of the first questions I asked them, before we went into the kitchen, was how would you like to be referred to as Duke and Duchess? And they immediately interrupted me and said no, as Harry and Meghan.”

Not only were they interested in learning all about the charity, they were also very hands on. “They drove in their own vehicle,” Richard told HL. “They took our food, a week’s worth of food delivered to each client. And they also took non perishable food, because we’re delivering it to every client, just in case of emergency and we can’t get to them, that they have food.”

“I think that Meghan wants to show Harry L.A. through the eyes of philanthropy and through the eyes of Project Angel Food. They really are concerned about vulnerable people. You know, especially with COVID. Our clients are the ones who are most prone to get the virus. And if they get it. They may die because most are over the age of 60, and they have heart disease, lung disease, diabetes. And Meghan and Harry, they were really interested in meeting the clients and talking to them and seeing how they were doing.”

Although Meghan was already familiar with Project Angel Food, Richard told HL that it was her mother, Doria Ragland, that suggested they help out at the highly respected charity. “Meghan says that because she lived in L.A. she knew about Project Angel Food. And they wanted to do something to volunteer on Easter, and she was talking to her mother and her mother said Project Angel Food needs help.”

Richard told HL that helping out during COVID-19 is a big concern for the couple. “They really care about people and about making the world a better place. And COVID is going on, and so, I think they thought Project Angel Food takes care of these people, let’s go see some of them. And they were really impressed with the gratitude that they received on behalf of Project Angel Food, people were just gushing about how this service is so important to them right now.

Since it’s inception in 1989, Project Angel Food as served over 12 million meals to more than 20,000 people. But with COVID-19 the need is even greater. “Right now we’re feeding 1,600 people a day but we are going to be adding 400 more people this month,” Richard told HL, “so we’re really in need of donations right now.”

"Have you ever received an invitation from your friends to play Candy Crush or Candy Crush Saga?

Candy Crush is a “puzzle adventure” where you “switch and match your way through hundreds of levels.” (king.com)

I have and still get invitations to play this game. At first I tried to be annoyed, as tradition expects, but I couldn’t be for long because these requests came from my very good friends and family. I also realized that I do much the same thing. I may not have shared Candy Crush or similar games, but I have shared other things that I’ve enjoyed and valued — often urging others to take a look and try them out. Such as, for example, books.

Besides that, I was curious. Not about Candy Crush itself, but about whether I could play a different game; one that wasn’t about taking a break or switching off from everyday chores (as I do when reading fiction or playing board games, and on a rare occasion some simple online ones), but could I have as much fun (or perhaps even more) as people do playing games, with the various projects I wanted to pursue?

Yes, I was contemplating gamification — even before I knew what it meant.

Sometime later I discovered that when you gamify your life you extract “the fun and addicting elements found in games” (Yu-kai Chou).

That was exactly what I wanted! I wanted to make progress with activities I was passionate about, and make time for them. We all allow ourselves a bit of time to play, don’t we? So why not combine the projects I was excited about with the fun elements of a game? Could I play at “writing a book?""

At the same time, I wondered if I could make the tasks I thought I didn’t enjoy but had to do (like applying for a new passport or cleaning and tidying our house), if not enjoyable, then at least a little bit fun by gamifying them.

It’s now been more than two years since I started a continuous gamification of my life. I’ve learned a lot along the way, including the fact that in addition to gamification there are other essential skills and approaches that can help make life, and what it brings along the way, fun and doable.

These discoveries, and the reactions of people to the experiences I’ve shared with them, have motivated me to write a book, and to follow a friend’s advice to turn it into a crowd-funding project.

Why this project is unique:

This book is not about gamifying just one activity and bringing elements of games into parts of our lives. It is about bringing game design, and the fun connected with it, to all areas of our lives, as well as gamifying project, time, and life-management.

The book will also have an emphasis on game design. By understanding how games and gamification frameworks function, you will be able to create your own, or use and combine the models of others to create multiple fun project designs of your own.

As a byproduct it will help you take your attention off what you want to avoid, or don’t like, and instead focus on what you want to achieve. And to do so in a continuously gameful manner.

How it is different to other books on gamification:

There are many brilliant books on gamification, some of them written by scholars and gamification pioneers. This book does not compete with them.

This book will complement them. It will add to the existing literature because gamification is not considered on its own here — it is supported by two other vital approaches, which result in the following skills when applied:

the ability to be here, to live in the moment, and

the ability to identify the next smallest step to be taken, which is an integral part of kaizen, “a Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement of working practices, personal efficiency, etc.” (oxforddictionaries.com)

By combining living in the moment, kaizen, and gamification to manage your projects — and your life — this book will be the first of its kind, enabling you to turn any activity into a fun, effortless, and successful game.

And there is another difference: I am not a gamer. That is, I rarely play games. I play board games from time to time with my family, and of all the online games, I only play Minesweeper, and even that less than a handful of times a year.

The most popular books on gamification are written by gamers who are also game designers, often of video games. I am neither a gamer nor a game designer. I last played a video game probably twenty years ago, and I don’t feel compelled to play one anytime soon. I would play if someone invited me, but only to enjoy their company, rather than from a keenness to play games. And even upon the repeated requests mentioned above, I’ve never wanted to play Candy Crush, although I do enjoy its bright colors and cheerful design, occasionally stopping to watch my son playing it.

So this book also has a unique perspective. It is written by someone with no great passion for games themselves, but who is keen to play games and have fun with everything else there is to do: both things to get excited about, and those one might find tedious.

How you can help me shape my book:

The book will show how various activities can be gamified and my lessons learned from them. So far, the notes I’ve made and articles I’ve written have concentrated on the projects from my gamified life as a writer, consultant, business owner, mother, wife, daughter, sister, aunt, and friend. So far I’ve addressed and plan to address writing, dealing with edits and feedback from someone else, self-editing, editing and revising someone else’s work, household, attending to family matters, structuring and managing a project, learning languages, helping a child gamify and complete his homework assignment, and more.

You as a reader can help me by identifying other topics to address, providing more ideas for gamification using the approach shown in the book (which in the spirit of Candy Crush I’ve started to think of as “Project Crush”).

"John Ruppert's striking composite photos of Icelandic terrain on display at Grimaldis Gallery

C. Grimaldis Gallery

C. Grimaldis Gallery

Tim Smith, The Baltimore Sun

For most of John Ruppert's career, metal sculpture has been a major focus, but he has added photography to his pursuits lately. Some of the results can be sampled and savored in an exhibit at C. Grimaldis Gallery titled ""The Iceland Project.""

The Massachusetts-born artist, who has a studio in Druid Hill, was one of the first winners of the $25,000 Baker Prize in 2009. He has been a faculty member at the University of Maryland, College Park, since 1987 and chair of its art department for the past 15 years.

Ruppert spent a month in Iceland and took a large number of shots that he subsequently fused to create ""multiple image composites"" of the stark, often sculptural terrain. The manipulative process is evident not just in the strangely colored skies, but also in subtle nuances that reveal themselves on closer inspection.

In a few of the works, the presence of human culture can be barely detected — a low fence winding through a desolate hilltop, for example, in ""Laki Ridge,"" a work that jolts with its avocado green sky.

Another such jolt is delivered by ""Black Lake, Orange Sky/Kleifarvatn."" This 40-by-40-inch print is 95 percent sky; at the bottom of the print, the placid lake creates a striking horizon line.

Ruppert has spoken of choosing ""turbulent"" hues for the skies as a way to suggest how things might have looked when Iceland was formed. And since that North Atlantic country remains very much geologically alive, the vibrancy in such photos becomes all the more telling.

Even in pieces without surprising celestial hues, there are unusual elements to be found. A horizontal view of a sea wall takes on the quality of a bold abstract canvas, with rock edges where brusque brush strokes would be. A vertical image of a waterfall is separated into sections, like a splice of movie film, and seems to roll like one, too.

One of the most impressive works, ""Hekla,"" is a long panoramic view (20x1091/2 inches) that captures Iceland's most active volcano in the distance with rolling, lunar-like hills in the foreground.

A bank of white clouds hovers around the peak, complementing the blankets of snow running along the mountainside. But not everything in the sky seems naturally cumulus. It looks as if bits of snow have peeled off the earth and floated up to meet the clouds.

Another compelling composite, ""Inside Crater/Laki,"" is a landscape in rich colors and shades. There's a painterly aspect to this — think late-Monet — right down to the bits of blurring where different photos have been gently meshed.

Ruppert's methods can be more upfront. In ""Glacier Crevasse/Svinafellsjokull,"" the beautifully composed image of weather-beaten snowpacks and bits of earth suddenly gains an extra edge when you spot the serrated side of a photo used to create one side of a hill.

The digital manipulation in these works does not make them less real, but, in a way, more personal. You sense an artist trying to encompass not just everything he saw in this wildly interesting place, but everything he felt, everything he wanted to grasp.

A few of the pieces that were in the exhibit when it opened are in Florida with the Grimaldis booth at the Art Miami fair, but are due back next week. Even without them, ""The Iceland Project"" provides an absorbing journey.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Do you not see [i.e., know] that to Allāh prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures and many of the people? But upon many the punishment has been justified. And he whom Allāh humiliates – for him there is no bestower of honour. Indeed, Allāh does what He wills.

See you not that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind? But there are many (men) on whom the punishment is justified. And whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him. Verily! Allah does what He wills.

Pickthall

Hast thou not seen that unto Allah payeth adoration whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the hills, and the trees, and the beasts, and many of mankind, while there are many unto whom the doom is justly due. He whom Allah scorneth, there is none to give him honour. Lo! Allah doeth what He will.

Yusuf Ali

Seest thou not that to Allah bow down in worship all things that are in the heavens and on earth,- the sun, the moon, the stars; the hills, the trees, the animals; and a great number among mankind? But a great number are (also) such as are fit for Punishment: and such as Allah shall disgrace,- None can raise to honour: for Allah carries out all that He wills.

Lessons/Guidance/Reflections/Gems

When we reflect on this verse we find countless creatures, some of which we know and some we do not; and we glance at an infinite number of worlds, many of which we do not begin to know; as also an endless variety of mountains, trees and beasts that live on earth, man’s abode. All these, without exception, join a single procession that prostrates itself in humble submission to God, addressing its worship, in perfect harmony, to Him alone. And out of all these creatures, man alone has a special case, as people diverge: “a great number of human beings [bow down in worship], but a great number also will inevitably have to suffer punishment,” because of their rejection of the truth. Thus, man stands out on his own, unique in that great, harmonious procession.

The verse concludes with a statement making clear that whoever deserves punishment will inevitably be humbled and disgraced: “He whom God shall disgrace will have none who could bestow honour on him.” How could such a person be honoured when all honour and respect are granted by God. In other words, anyone who submits to any being other than God Almighty, to whom the entire universe willingly submits, will be disgraced.

Period of Revelation

As this Surah contains the characteristics of both the Makkan and the MadÄ«nan Surahs the commentators have differed as to its period of revelation but in the light of its style and themes we are of the opinion that a part of it (v. 1-24) was sent down in the last stage of the Makkan life of the Prophet a little before migration and the rest (v. 25-78) during the first stage of his Madinah life. That is why this Surah combines the characteristics of both the Makkan and the Madinah Surahs.

According to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah and other great commentators, v. 39 is the first verse that grants the Muslims permission to wage war. Collections of hadith and books on the life of the Prophet confirm that after this permission actual preparations for war were started and the first expedition was sent to the coast of the Red Sea in Safar 2 A.H. which is known as the Expedition of Waddan or Al-Abwa.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"One of the most vexing questions in African-American history is whether free African Americans themselves owned slaves. The short answer to this question, as you might suspect, is yes, of course; some free black people in this country bought and sold other black people, and did so at least since 1654, continuing to do so right through the Civil War. For me, the really fascinating questions about black slave-owning are how many black “masters” were involved, how many slaves did they own and why did they own slaves?

The answers to these questions are complex, and historians have been arguing for some time over whether free blacks purchased family members as slaves in order to protect them—motivated, on the one hand, by benevolence and philanthropy, as historian Carter G. Woodson put it, or whether, on the other hand, they purchased other black people “as an act of exploitation,” primarily to exploit their free labor for profit, just as white slave owners did. The evidence shows that, unfortunately, both things are true. {snip}

In a fascinating essay reviewing this controversy, R. Halliburton shows that free black people have owned slaves “in each of the thirteen original states and later in every state that countenanced slavery,” at least since Anthony Johnson and his wife Mary went to court in Virginia in 1654 to obtain the services of their indentured servant, a black man, John Castor, for life.

And for a time, free black people could even “own” the services of white indentured servants in Virginia as well. Free blacks owned slaves in Boston by 1724 and in Connecticut by 1783; by 1790, 48 black people in Maryland owned 143 slaves. One particularly notorious black Maryland farmer named Nat Butler “regularly purchased and sold Negroes for the Southern trade,” Halliburton wrote.

Perhaps the most insidious or desperate attempt to defend the right of black people to own slaves was the statement made on the eve of the Civil War by a group of free people of color in New Orleans, offering their services to the Confederacy, in part because they were fearful for their own enslavement: “The free colored population [native] of Louisiana … own slaves, and they are dearly attached to their native land … and they are ready to shed their blood for her defense. They have no sympathy for abolitionism; no love for the North, but they have plenty for Louisiana … They will fight for her in 1861 as they fought [to defend New Orleans from the British] in 1814-1815.”

These guys were, to put it bluntly, opportunists par excellence: As Noah Andre Trudeau and James G. Hollandsworth Jr. explain, once the war broke out, some of these same black men formed 14 companies of a militia composed of 440 men and were organized by the governor in May 1861 into “the Native Guards, Louisiana,” swearing to fight to defend the Confederacy. Although given no combat role, the Guards—reaching a peak of 1,000 volunteers—became the first Civil War unit to appoint black officers.

When New Orleans fell in late April 1862 to the Union, about 10 percent of these men, not missing a beat, now formed the Native Guard/Corps d’Afrique to defend the Union. {snip}

{snip}

So what do the actual numbers of black slave owners and their slaves tell us? In 1830, the year most carefully studied by Carter G. Woodson, about 13.7 percent (319,599) of the black population was free. Of these, 3,776 free Negroes owned 12,907 slaves, out of a total of 2,009,043 slaves owned in the entire United States, so the numbers of slaves owned by black people over all was quite small by comparison with the number owned by white people. {snip}

{snip} So why did these free black people own these slaves?

It is reasonable to assume that the 42 percent of the free black slave owners who owned just one slave probably owned a family member to protect that person, as did many of the other black slave owners who owned only slightly larger numbers of slaves. {snip}

{sni}

{snip} Halliburton concludes, after examining the evidence, that “it would be a serious mistake to automatically assume that free blacks owned their spouse or children only for benevolent purposes.” {snip} In other words, most black slave owners probably owned family members to protect them, but far too many turned to slavery to exploit the labor of other black people for profit.

{snip}

If we were compiling a “Rogues Gallery of Black History,” the following free black slaveholders would be in it:

John Carruthers Stanly—born a slave in Craven County, N.C., the son of an Igbo mother and her master, John Wright Stanly—became an extraordinarily successful barber and speculator in real estate in New Bern. As Loren Schweninger points out in Black Property Owners in the South, 1790-1915, by the early 1820s, Stanly owned three plantations and 163 slaves, and even hired three white overseers to manage his property! He fathered six children with a slave woman named Kitty, and he eventually freed them. Stanly lost his estate when a loan for $14,962 he had co-signed with his white half brother, John, came due. After his brother’s stroke, the loan was Stanly’s sole responsibility, and he was unable to pay it.

{snip}

Antoine Dubuclet and his wife Claire Pollard owned more than 70 slaves in Iberville Parish when they married. According to Thomas Clarkin, by 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, they owned 100 slaves, worth $94,700. During Reconstruction, he became the state’s first black treasurer, serving between 1868 and 1878.

Andrew Durnford was a sugar planter and a physician who owned the St. Rosalie plantation, 33 miles south of New Orleans. In the late 1820s, David O. Whitten tells us, he paid $7,000 for seven male slaves, five females and two children. He traveled all the way to Virginia in the 1830s and purchased 24 more. Eventually, he would own 77 slaves. When a fellow Creole slave owner liberated 85 of his slaves and shipped them off to Liberia, Durnford commented that he couldn’t do that, because “self interest is too strongly rooted in the bosom of all that breathes the American atmosphere.”

{snip}

Most of us will find the news that some black people bought and sold other black people for profit quite distressing, as well we should. But given the long history of class divisions in the black community, which Martin R. Delany as early as the 1850s described as “a nation within a nation,” and given the role of African elites in the long history of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, perhaps we should not be surprised that we can find examples throughout black history of just about every sort of human behavior, from the most noble to the most heinous, that we find in any other people’s history.

The good news, scholars agree, is that by 1860 the number of free blacks owning slaves had markedly decreased from 1830. In fact, Loren Schweninger concludes that by the eve of the Civil War, “the phenomenon of free blacks owning slaves had nearly disappeared” in the Upper South, even if it had not in places such as Louisiana in the Lower South. {snip}

Owning a black slave is useless. It took three of them to do the work of one person. The biggest mistake in world history: bringing Africans to the western hempishere.

Uh no; some Jews took part, naturally, as they were the most involved ethnic group in merchandizing in Western Europe since Roman times. They sure taught the Dutch how to do it, and it was the Dutch that brought the first slaves to the American Colonies when New York was still New Amsterdam. The Dutch were the first and first most successful non-Jewish international traders, founding and settling South Africa because it was on their route to India and points East. But the funniest thing about this article is the idea that we ought to be surprised that blacks sold blacks. Whites have sold whites, Chinese sold Chinese, etc. This idea of projecting PC attitude retrospectively is about as nonobjective and unscholarly possible.

MarkLuger

I have a list of 15 slave ships owned by Jews. I also have a dvd of Professor Tony Martin explaining how Dutch jews ran the slave trade. Before they got involved with black slaves; jews kidnapped white girls from Europe and sold them to the Middle East. What is the obsession with black slaves? The slaves lived longer than the orphans yanks placed in coal mines and textile mills until 1900; and the slaves were better off than people in Africa are right now. Thanks for the email; have you seen David duke’s website? How about http://www.theneworder.org

Katherine McChesney

According to my brother-in-law from Holland, the Dutch originated the black slave trade.

MarkLuger

According to professor Tony Martin from Boston college Dutch Jews ran the black slave trade. Did you know there are over 300,000 girls used as sex slaves in America right now. The sex slave industry starts in Hollywood and Las Vegas and operates in the biggest cities in Amercia. I have alist of 15 slave ships owned by jews, would you like to see it?

I have a list of even more white Europeans who not only had slave ships, but in earlier days sold other white Europeans to North Africans; it’s called “well known history,” opposed to your cadre of David Duke’s mythologizing obsession with Jews and Israel.

Formerly_Known_as_Whiteplight

I have Dutch friends, too. They said the Jews were only financiers at first because only Jews had the money because Christians were forbidden to handle money early on and the Jews had always been traders. These David Duke guys manufacture phoney data without missing a beat. I have several books on the history of slave trade that tell the story, quite different from David Duke and his minions.

HamletsGhost

I’m not a minion of David Duke, but if he speaks the truth, you should pay more attention to him than to your Dutch friends.

Is it phoney to note that the first synagogue in the United States was founded not in New York, but in Newport, R.I., a major port for the trianglular slave-sugar-rum trade?

The fact that so many people reflexively jump to the Jews’ defense even without hearing the charge evokes the same reactions of people who vehemently insist that Jews don’t control Hollywood, although spending 5 minutes watching the credits roll after every flick should make that question a no-brainer.

In the 90s, a British journalist by the name of Cash noted exactly that, and the flurry of threats disguised as criticism wrought an apology and an admission from him that yes, the Emperor’s new clothes are indeed magnificent.

Le Gaulois

You’re absolutely correct and Duke’s data is actually well documented and backed up by Jewish sources in most cases. Incidentally, he has easily exposed the well known FACT that the Jews indeed control Hollywood by simply quoting Joel Stein who bragged all about it in his L.A Times column:

If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, looks like a duck, guess what ?

While there are Jews involved, they are NOT at the top of the pyramid, so to speak.

Jews back in Jesus’ time said “We have no king but Caesar.” Today it’s “we have no king but the pope.” Seriously.

The Vatican has long had a policy of anti-Semitism (even HITLER admitted this). Jews are just a front. Sadly so many are willing to sell out. Why do you think the Rothschilds are known as the pope’s bankers?

What better way to stir up fury against the Jews (thus setting the stage for the Great Tribulation, known as JACOB’S Trouble) than to make them your scapegoats?

HamletsGhost

Seriously? What Jews proclaim they have “no king but the pope”. Can you even name one?

Seriously you need to put away the Jeeboo juice. Seriously.

Ah, and it’s also the other way around: Many condemn the Jews because they hate them for being Jews.

Spoken like a true gliberal. I suppose you condemn blacks because you hate them for being black.

The jews, the Lobby, and their minions manufacture phoney data without missing a beat. Neither side of the conflict you’re commenting on is innocent of this.

“According to my brother-in-law from Holland, the Dutch originated the black slave trade.”

If that verifiable or is that just the prevailing white self-hatred confession taught in the schools there from early childhood?

saxonsun

The first slave ship to come here was a Dutch slaver in 1619; that’s been my understanding.

That is not true. The blacks in Africa that captured and sold other blacks were muslims.

The lyrics of the song “Jet to Jet”, by the 80’s metal band Alcatrazz, express it best: “Black man’s burden is well on his shoulders, keeps him well in his place. 200 pounds worth of N*&^*r weight, it smacks him in the face. There’s no way he should stand for this”–Graham Bonnett, an Englishman, was the lyricist, telling the truth about Black-White race relations in this great song. We have been laboring under the burden of their laziness, ineptitude, and sociopathy for far too long, and we Whites are the ones bearing an albatross.

Cheap labor? They don’t work that much.

The work of Robert Fogel at least puts your claim in serious doubt.

Sherman_McCoy

“Time on the Cross” was an interesting book, though I don’t see why if it’s claims that blacks were as valuable chattel relatively well treated and worked less than did Northern industrial workers are violently objected to, should be seen as more believable than his widely accepted claim of black productivity.

In any case, it appears that blacks WERE obviously more useful as slaves than they are as welfare parasites and murderous, rapacious thugs.

A Univ of Chicago economist,with a Nobel in his pants, GaryBecker,claims that the back slaves ate a better diet than the white immigrants up North.The slaves were well treated. The Latin American slaves,OTOH,OY VEY!!!!!

Also, “Without Consent or Contract”, c. 1990, which is a smoother read than “TotC”.

YngveKlezmer

Biggest mistake indeed. Slackin’ is what they do best. Our type of work ethic is just not in their temperament. Even the well educated ones have the same desire to slack off as much as possible. Take a White supervisor out of the equation, especially, and next to nothing is accomplished, regardless of the task at hand.

LastBastionOfHope

I always wonder what the reaction of our forefathers would be if they could see that blacks now hold whites hostage in their own country. They would probably be absolutely shocked and reinstate slavery.

josh

As everyone here knows by now,slaves were often easily procured by offering payment in desired goods to the African chiefs,who would gladly sell off their own subjects. I think something similar is happening RIGHT NOW. I call it The Grand Bargain. Its simple. The black leadership knows immigration is a disaster fior blacks.Yet they happily-even slavishly,heh heh– go along. Obama is crazy for immigration. He knows damn well that a huge segment of the black populace is literally finished. their is no place for them. NONE. They will live in EBT depravity forever,devolving into a nation of Shitaviouses. Yet blacks go along and say NOTHING,as long as they get theirs.

saxonsun

This is why we keep black males in prison as long as possible. Can you imagine the nightmare if they were on our streets?

refocus

Was it not the King of England and those support that institution who forced the slaves into the new world?

Did the Founders; Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, try to get rid of slavery but could not as the monied interests would not support manumission and repatriation along with the revolution?

Northerner

Whether or not that’s actually true, the more important part to slave owners was that they didn’t have to pay them.

slaves were never needed

That is exactly why African slavery was such a major misguided mistake from the gitgo in the newly opened western hemisphere and total economic insanity not to mention the massive costs and upkeep that bankrupted 50% of large plantations. Hired help paid wages and sharecropping was by far a more eco superior system. Obviously slavery was also a white labor force killer and a major reason non-elite whites lived in such rural poverty in the south as opposed to the north where industrialization jobs were plentiful

It was a bad system and never needed. The major blame goes on the African tribal chiefs who not only cashed in off slavery to the west but killed 2 birds with one stones by cleansing their rejects and undesirables.

saxonsun

And no one speaks about the poor white problem in this country and how released slaves greatly contributed to it.

You’ll NEVER see this information taught in a class on ‘Afro-American Studies’.

blacks must’ve been better behaved back then – b/c who on god’s green earth would want to own one today? yuck.

YngveKlezmer

I doubt it. On those farms where a White family only had several Blacks on hand as slaves, the same thing happened as happens now. When one, or just a few Blacks are amongst a large number of Whites, and we vastly outnumber them, the strength of our European culture positively influences them, and their behavior improves.
It is like when you have one or two Blacks in a room with 10 Whites. Those Blacks start to act a lot more White because our culture is the dominant force. Remove 8 of those Whites, though, and replace them with 8 Blacks in the same room, and those Blacks that had acted so nicely around us beginning acting like the other Blacks, and Black culture prevails. The Whites end up leaving the room by choice, and primitve Black culture returns.

Tom Iron

Everything with them is an imitation. When, as you say, they’re acting right, it’s only because they’re outnumbered, not because of any in depth concept of proper behavior.

Jss

Well what makes blacks owning slaves less terrible then Whites owning slaves is blacks at least weren’t racist against there slaves. It’s like when blacks rape and murder Whites. It’s not as bad as what happened to Tanya Brawley and Traybon because at least when Blacks are killing and raping us it isn’t racist.

pcmustgo

Blacks always break out this apples and oranges argument when I mention islamic enslavement of blacks…. “Well, at least the muslims didn’t force them to lose their culture…” Really?

Whatever, Jss, the point is don’t blame us all when 99% of us aren’t descended from slave owners.

Maybe you could spend some time learning about different European cultures- Germans, French, Italians, Spaniards, Norwegians, Russians, Polish…

We’re not just “white”.

JDInSanDiego

The muslims castrated them. How’s that for preserving their culture?

ladyL

I don’t know what your race/ethnicity is, but as a Descendant of African American Slaves I say that this is not true. If anyone of a race commits a crime against someone of another race and their motives are based on that person being different it is racism. For a Black person to treat a White person ( or one that “appears” to be so) with ignorance and disrespect it is NO different when it is done to them. This a lie that is bought and sold and adds to “the white man owes me all he has and ever will have simply because my people were brought here on a ship, made to work 16 hour days in the hot sun for free, beaten and hung…….” This is not correct behavior. I nor my husband were raised to act this way and nor will my children. I apologize if you were treated badly by people of my race.

Tom Iron

Well, slavery had its day. But that day is long over. What would anyone want a black for a slave for nowadays? They can’t do any productive work in this society that exists today. They’re just here hanging out and carrying on until we finally get tired of putting up with their antics and finally get rid of them, one way or another.

Luca

Actually, slavery is alive and well in that wonderful continent of Africa. They like to tout that Africa is known as the birthplace of Man, but it seems it’s the birthplace of slavery too. They always forget to mention that.

Nathanwartooth

It’s also still useful there because they aren’t out of the stone age yet.

The more advanced the civilization the less use they have for slaves.

ultimate penal colony

Africa was the birthplace of slavery not man but there are plenty of dead ape skulls that evolutionist atheists refer to as early first humans that is total BS unless they were from the original single human race who washed down there from Mesopotamia during the great flood 4500 yrs ago according to the ancient jew Book. Africa was nothing more than the original ultimate penal colony for wild animals and the wild Ham race similar to penal colonies in Australia where the worse criminals were dropped off permanently by the British Empire. Maybe they got the idea from the Torah.

The US military uses Guantanamo Naval base in south Cuba as its proxy penal colony for muslim nutbags but needs to begin sending its own convicted urban criminal murdering thugs there to save billions who would quickly become meek lmice plus cure any fag activity or risk beheadment using sharp objects. If they thought bringing back the death penalty would help prevent capital crime in America they never tried Gitgo.

Katherine McChesney

I think blacks are just like children, immature, lazy by nature, like to play, demanding, attracted to junk, excitable, mean-spirited when they don’t get their way, manipulative, insecure…well, you get the picture. They’re stuck in a permanent childhood.

Torshammar

Yes. They lack control of their own emotions. They act on impulse. They are like children. And we keep paying for them. Let’s stop doing that permanently and live together as Whites. As one without the other.

joegoofinoff

Yes, I’m reading a book published in 1901 written by a black guy entitled, “The American Negro,” authors name, William Hannibal Thomas. If he lived today, he’d be right there with Mr. Taylor. His condemnation of black behavior is total. There was never a Klansman who ever said anything more harsh than this black man about black people. Also, he condemns to the high heavens those Whites (liberals of his time) who think they were helping blacks but in reality are hurting them worse than the worst racist.

“From the experience of all ages and nations, I believe, that the work done by free men comes cheaper in the end than the work performed by slaves. Whatever work he does, beyond what is sufficient to purchase his own maintenance, can be squeezed out of him by violence only, and not by any interest of his own.”

A surprisingly honest piece from Prof Gates, who was most famously dishonest and wrong when dealing with the Cambridge police in 2009. Of course it became much more dishonest when the Idiot in Chief announced that the Cambridge police “acted stupidly”.

In this piece Gates asserts that some blacks bought family members as an at of benevolence to free them and this is true; some did. But what would have been nice and a bit more balanced is if he also had stated that far more white abolishionists and religious organizations, did this and on a far greater scale.

Most of the blacks who owned slaves, especially in Louisiana, were not altogether black per se but mulatto, quadroon or further miscegenated. African Americans are very conscious of skin tone and percentage of white blood and the lighter ones have frequently felt superior to their darker brethren. Turns out blacks are racist toward other (darker) blacks too.

AutomaticSlim

Not so sure I would refer to him as a professor.
I wouldn’t give much credit to anyone whose field of “expertise” ends in the word “studies”.

MBlanc46

His PhD is in English literature from Cambridge.

AutomaticSlim

Perhaps, but his wikipedia page states that he was a lecturer in “afro-american studies” at Yale and Duke prior to joining Harvard as a “professor of English”. And then if you scroll down to the books he has written, you will notice that none of them have anything to do with English Literature, but rather are the typical black-studies kind of garbage you would expect from a guy like this. Books with titles such as “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man”.

Katherine McChesney

and he probably promotes Afrocentrism.

MBlanc46

His earlier books were lit crit, focusing on Afro-American literature. He’s become something of a public figure and television celebrity and his more recent work has been directed at the more general audience. His PhD is a real one (his first book is basically his dissertation), he’s a real scholar, and not an Afro-Centrist.

AutomaticSlim

All of the titles I saw had something to do with blacks, in one way or another.
He even had a book with the word “monkey” in the title.

Is he an actual PhD, or like so many “Professors”, Black and White, “Ph.D. (cand)?” To me, the title “Professor” refers to a professor who does not have a doctorate.

fred

To be fair, he doesn’t look to be much more than a quarter black. though the victim mentality is obviously strong in him.

I had to deal with a fool like him at work who accused me of not dealing fairly with blacks. This guy looked Egyptian but had an English name, he must have been 1/16th black; he was probably Creole.. I told him I didn’t even know he was black. I guess I neglected to give him special treatment. You know that ol’ one drop rule, they’ll wear that race card out even if they can only claim 1/16th of it.

torshammar

I’ve experienced the same on numerous occasions. Let’s put an end to it.

Luca

He should have studied law. That Cambridge cop was right to call him outside and he was wrong to rant and rave. No one ever mentions this, but if a cop thinks someone broke into your home and you are the homeowner, you could have a perp hiding in the closet or somewhere else, so it’s wise to ask the homeowner to come outside while the cops search the home. Someone should have mentioned this to him and the Kenyan, but then it would have shattered the narrative the media was trying to portray.

And I am still promulgating the theory that Gates planned this in advance because he wanted an incident with a cop. That’s because he wanted the publicity, as he was becoming yesterday’s news in the universe of black studies talking heads. He just never expected actually to be arrested.

AutomaticSlim

That’s a very reasonable theory given all the hoaxes these “black studies” types undertake on college campuses.

Also reasonable considering that blacks have a world class reputation for engaging in cheap stunts and theater in order to get people to pay attention to them.

Luca

Al except Rev. Al Sharptongue, he is a true man of principle and morals. (gag)

From the start I thought that it was intentional but I never considered ‘planned.’ I assumed the Obama presidency profoundly disconcerted africanistas; no longer could they exploit black victimology. Plus, it was so displacing in terms of attention, glory, power and so I sensed, given the timing particularly, intent to provoke. If he planned it, though, he would have needed to get arrested to actually make news.

I don’t think he necessarily needed to be arrested, but he wanted and in fact needed to be accosted. From then, open trap, and there would come running the Boston media and soon after the national media.

pcmustgo

ditto in caribbean, mulatto elite

YngveKlezmer

Because they know that White genes mean better intellect and behavior, and this is why Black men who are climbing the socioeconomic ladder love to miscegenate with White women. We Whites should all be repulsed by this, as the White party involved in miscegenation is literally throwing their heritage in the garbage. The result will not only not be in the likeness of the White parent, but will surely have an inferior intellect to what would be possible with a racially pure White child. Even if the White parent is not the sharpest tool in the shed, the roll of the dice of genetics means that the odds are against the Mulatto having a stronger intellect. This is why miscegenation used to be against the law, and still should be.

Nathanwartooth

Well to be fair the subtext of the article was that many Blacks bought slaves to help people but Whites did not.

You can’t hide the past but you can change how it is presented.

Daisy

Gates says it would be ‘fair to assume’ that 43% of the black slaveholders bought family members as that was the percentage of black owners having one or just a few slaves. I don’t know that asserting that all of that 43% were benevolent is justified; many whites owned just one or a couple slaves. “If you love someone, set them free.” If these black owners really loved their slaves they wouldn’t have ‘owned’ them but would have simply freed them. He also makes another sketchy conclusion, asserting that it was an act of progress that fewer blacks owned slaves over time, but it seems obvious this may have been due to whites increasingly refusing to sell to them as the Civil War loomed.

sbuffalonative

This article is why Mr. Gates is persona non-grata in the black community. Sometimes he tells the truth and blacks appreciate only the truths that fit their black-and-white agenda.

In other words, most black slave owners probably owned family members to protect them, but far too many turned to slavery to exploit the labor of other black people for profit.
So blacks exploited black labor for their own benefit. This isn’t shocking. What’s surprising is how blacks have managed to keep this quiet for this long.
Blacks have been enslaving blacks for centuries. They’re still doing it today. In some black nations, it’s not even questioned.

YngveKlezmer

Mr. Gates is either lying, or expressing self-serving bias with this. I am inclined to believe that he is engaging in the former. Blacks do not have the same reverence for the truth that we do, and education does not change this in them.

sbuffalonative

When it comes to black history which places blacks an unfavorable light, blacks turn to the idea of ‘nuanced’ history.
It works like this:
While whites are evil incarnate, blacks can be forgiven and excused for their past sins because their are always reasons for their actions. Blacks are, by nature, good and kind people who have been forced to do bad things because ‘the (blue eyed) devil made them do it’.
This is nothing more than Mr. Gates’ attempt to blunt an historical fact that portrays blacks in a bad light

anarchyst

“Nuanced” history also applies to those of the “tribe” that STILL make excuses for their “invention”–communism. They still state that communism is viable “if properly applied”. Communism eventually “turned” on its “inventors . . .

What it “proves” is that it wasn’t an exclusively white sin, even here at ground zero for supposed white evil, pre-Civil War America. You know, you’d almost think that, to your mind, the “racism” you want to morally preen over was a greater misdeed than the slavery itself.

MBlanc46

“What it “proves” is that it wasn’t an exclusively white sin”.

Well said.

Jss

You are taking a simplistic view of slavery. While black on black slavery was unfortunate it was less relevant in the historical context because only White on black slavery was racist and White racism is the only thing past or present that is wrong in the world. Do you think what happened to Shannon Newsom was as bad as what happened to Crystal whatever from the duke lacrosse case? If you do you are a racist, white supremacist, neo nazi Klansman.

You see if you stop looking through the post neo colonial, social pan optical, social dialectic of patriarchal economic matrix’s you will see that anytime blacks do something wrong its just a construct of White oppression. So in the name of racial justice and healing we racist Whites need to pay all blacks on the planet reparations for black on black slavery.

I swear hear in Brooklyn, we attract a lot of these sociologist types who move into black neighborhoods and then whine about other whites moving in and gentrifying them.

Many whites have a “Dancing with Wolves”, “I’m here to Rescue the Blacks/Oppressed Non-White People martyr complex”.

YngveKlezmer

If we pay them back for slavery, than we are paying them back for former injustices committed. If we pay them back for injustices, the right and just thing would be for them to pay us back for the injustices committed against us. This would mean that they owe millions of us for having worked harder than we need to at our jobs while Black co-workers slack off and are not punished due to their race, and they owe millions of us for bullying us just for being White in school, and for acting of savage violence committed against us just because we are White.
A prime example is the present conditions in South Africa. Whites are the victims of a genocide campaign. Should not every BLack who has hurt a killed a White in that country be required to pay reparations to that WHite, or to their family??

libertarian 1234

These people live, breath, sleep and eat slavery and racism 24/7 to the exclusion, ALMOST, of everything else. And everything they do wrong, everything they fail in, every pathology within their group, is blamed on these two things…..perpetrated by whitey of course.

They do as they do, because they’re basically arrogant and have a delusionally inflated image of themselves, so they need to blame their failures on something besides their own incompetence.

The only other alternative they have is to admit they can’t cut it in a first world society, and they’re not about to admit that. Besides the perks they get from the radicals on the left and their status as privileged subjects of the empire are too good to give up.

Notice that this Gates, or Farrakhan, or Jesse or Al, or Tavist Smiley, or Cornel West or Michael Dyson, et al, never mention that blacks in other societies outside of the US, whose ancestors were never slaves, don’t do any better than US blacks.

I’m wondering what kind of excuses they would give in response to that? It would be interesting to hear, if for no other reason than to get a good laugh.

Such simple people getting paid at the very least hundreds of thousands of dollars if not millions, when there is absolutely nothing else that they could be doing which gives them a minimum salary which puts them clearly in the Top 1% of income earners (and usually more)…then the big bad commissioner locks them out…what else are they to think? Don’t expect their wee little brains to grok first world nuances about organized labor disputes.

YngveKlezmer

Actually, Blacks in their native Africa have a far worse standard of living than they do in our country. Even Blacks in Detroit or Gary are far better off than they would be in Africa. Gates, Tavis Smiley, Farrakhan, Obama, and all of the rest of the high profile Blacks who play these race games know this. They are race hustlers, and are willful in what they are doing. Their intent is to steal as much as they can from our European societies,

I can tell you what they’d say. They’d say its because Africans cannot repay the billions in loans made to them by Western nations, therefore modern Africans are living in a sort of continental debtor’s prison. How can the poor starving sub-Saharans attain first world status when they start out so far in debt? In other words, they’d say its whitey’s fault.

White countries were the first ones to abolish slavery. Only 2% of Whites owned slaves in the USA. Many Whites were indentured servants or slaves or serfs through history. See Jim Goad’s Redneck Manifesto and another book he references They Were White And They Were Slaves.

The Cherokee also owned black slaves.

Also, 95% of trans-Atlantic slave trade was not for the USA. And finally black slaves traders pleaded with England to not abolish slavery in the early 1800s.

But keep believing what they teach in school that all Whites owned all the blacks as slaves, and no blacks were slave-owners and no Whites were slaves.

They were white and they were slaves – written by Michael Hoffman II, and well worth reading.

Paleoconn

Agreed, and the fact that slavery among these peoples go on to this very day, but do-gooder liberals like to moralize on White man’s past transgressions rather than focus on the evil present in the here and now. It is why we will continue to hear about how bad Apartheid was (even though millions of black Africans moved there under the Apartheid regime), but we won’t hear a peep about the shithole the country is degenerating to each day under bantu rule.

Again, like I mentioned, attempting to save face after his anti-white, racist personal attack against that innocent white cop.

The__Bobster

Freed slaves had a great rate of slave ownership than did Whites.

And the lead rabble rouser on the Amistad, Cinque, became a slave trader himself.

Snowhitey

And Henry Louis Gates has also admitted on “The Root” website that it was only 378,000 Africans that were brought to what is now the United States as slaves. Liberals refuse to believe this and state it was anywhere from several million to as many as 20 million over several centuries. I believe South America received more than North American, far more. You see, the figure 378,000, which turned into about 42,000,000 today, just doesn’t seem as horrific so they change it without any consequences.

Our history is not distorted by the revisionists, it is completely and totally changed.

pcmustgo

Gates has been writing these articles almost as an apology to white folk after the gates-gate incident where he falsely accused a cop of racism. Throwing us a bone, atoning, at least to save public face.

He wrote another great article a bit after that about how the myth blacks push about “africans not knowing how cruel the slave trade was to their fellow africans” as joke given that the children of African chiefs would ride aboard these ships to get an education in europe. And not in the cargo section, like the rest of the slaves. And they had to have seen the poor treatment.

Gates does this as if to say, “I’m not a Black Racist after all!”

But I guess whites have to be happy anytime Blacks “throw us a bone”. They’re never very fair minded to the rest of the time.

MBlanc46

I don’t know which liberals you’re talking about, but c. 400,000 is the generally accepted figure in the literature on the subject.

Snowhitey

No one mentioned literature although I am quite confident there are thousands of books that distort the actual figures. Here’s a good place to start. The liberal website “The Stranger.”

“During the period of slavery the slave population in the slave states was around 25%. According to shipping records in London over 12 million slaves passed through London on their way to america until slavery was outlawed in
England in 1810. London was only one of several major ports of “export”. France outlawed it earlier in 1789, the USA not until after the Civil War, free labor was good for business. The total number of slaves imported into the US has been reliably estimated as being around 20 to 30 million during the approximate 300 years we had slavery.”

The way blacks breed, we’d have about 300,000,000 of them in this country alone. Although it often seems there are that many.

The Internet is filled with comments like this one. Time to take off the paper bag.

MBlanc46

I tend to read real books rather than Internet sites. The information is very much better. I’m talking about the major researchers researchers of the last fifty years such as Stampp, Fogel, and Genovese. You mention “thousands of books that distort the actual figure”, but you don’t give a single citation.

MikeofAges

The United States banned the importation of slaves in 1808. Maybe 60,000 were imported illegally between then and 1860. Maybe about 250,000 imported during the first 20 years under the constitution. About 400,000 between 1600 and the 1787.

The rest went elsewhere in the Americas, to the Spanish and Portuguese colonies primarily.

sbuffalonative

This is why Gates is hated by blacks.

While he tries to frame historical issues in terms of black suffering, he does try to stick with factual data; ie. the true number of blacks slaves was lower than blacks want to believe and blacks did own slaves.

He was vilified by blacks for his PBS series, Wonders of the African worldhttp://www.pbs.org/wonders/ because he interviewed African descendants involved in the slave trade. He tried to get them to apologies but they wouldn’t.

He gave a lecture that was broadcast on c-span and after he was almost lynched by the angry black mob.

YngveKlezmer

Of course they owned other Blacks as slaves, and of course their motivations were not altruistic, as Sharpton, Jackson, and Farrakhan would love for us White follks to believe. The primary reason Blacks became slaves was that Africa was, and still is, in a constant state of tribal warfare. When the European ships first arrived in the African ports, Europeans were offered African slaves for sale. These slaves had been held in bondage by rival African tribes in interior areas, and had been treated far worse by their fellow Africans than they would be by their White purchasers.
In comparison, in fact, White Southerners were downright humane in their treatment of their slaves when compared to treatment at the hands of their fellow Africans. In keeping with their European cultural heritage, White Southerners, by and large, treated Blacks as people, fed them well and made sure they had good living quarters, and only expected what was reasonable, that their slaves would be good workers.
Interviews of former Black slaves, done around 1900, in fact, reflected that at least 70% of then former slaves had nothing but good memories of their White masters. They had been fed and clothed well, and treated with respect and kindness. Many, in fact, chose not to leave the White families they had worked for after the Emancipation Proclamation freed them, because they had had a good life in slave days, and obviously feared having to make their own way in the world.
How much better a testimony could one ask for to the benevolence of European Americans?? We racial realists who have been around Blacks know their temperament, and how difficult they are. My suspicion is that, most often, the White slave master was far too kind to his Black slaves, and that the slaves tended to slack off as much as possible, and were actually a burden on the farming operation. When slaves were beaten, most likely it was the case of a good man who lost his temper, and for good reason. Work simply had not been done despite a first rate meal, massive amounts of food or goods had been stolen, a Wife or Daughter had been harassed or even sexually violated, etc.
In the case of the Black slave masters mentioned in this article, my suspicion is that true slavery was probably the rule with their slavery, with daily beatings, a rudimentary diet, sexual slavery of the young women, etc. After all, this has always been, and always will be the way society operates in Africa. In Liberia, where most former American slaves lived upon resettlement in Africa after Emancipation Proclamation, slavery was shamefully brutal, not even comparable to the good old American South.

One can imagine the fun had blacks been in a position to own whites as slaves.

Bill Dietyl

Somehow I dont think Whites would have been treated very well. The women would have been sexual toys and the men used for target practise.

Northerner

Blacks may have had black slaves, and African leaders may have been involved in the slave trade sending blacks to America… but at the end of the day, the degree / magnitude of interracial slavery by white slave owners of blacks is the only thing people care about. The kicker is that this isn’t ancient history; It happened in a time when clear records were kept and is close enough to the present that people still remember.

When England merchant banker Rothchilde came up with the idea to finance slavery he knew it was not needed and a terrible economic idea and a death knell to the entire western hemisphere but saw an opportunity to scam elite landowners looking for cheap labor while charging as high as 50,000 in todays prices for each slave from Africa. Noone knows what tribal chiefs sold them off for who were usually their captives in warfare or rejects of the tribes, but it was probably very little. Clearly there was a mass sales market over 250 yrs that European nations bought these rejects off the chieftains involving tens of millions as tribal leaders purged and cleansed their African continent of their undesirables and hocked them off to plague the western nations creating a boondoggle of immense size that has only gotten worse and allowed the introduction of the scavenger Marx and his peasant tool Lincoln who never attended a day of school or college in his life and posed as a fake lawyer only after being discharged from the Mex American war by US Military Academy grads Gen Robert E Lee and Gen Jefferson Davis after only a few months going AWOL in cowardly fashion in 1848. Lincoln then went to Springfield IL to try his hand at politics since politics and religion are the last refuge of the scoundrel. America was doomed.

Thor Bonham

So they actually should be paying themselves reparations, eh ?

Of course, blacks owned slaves in the ante-bellum South. Blacks were complicit in the slave trade in Africa, which couldn’t exist without their cooperation. I suspect that slavery is still practiced in some African backwaters. Whites are foolish to feel guilty for historical slavery. Particularly, as it was universally practiced and was eliminated by Europeans before most other countries.

Daisy

Whites don’t feel internal guilt so much as they are shamed by the powers-that-be for not feeling it.

bigone4u

I doubt that even one in a hundred college students knows that blacks owned and still own slaves. Spread this info around and cite the source of the original article, which appears to be a pro-black website. If you cite Amren as the source, you will be dismissed by many liberals.

sbuffalonative

Yes, always use original source material. In this case, The Roots article by [black] academic Henry Louis Gates Jr.

If you cite AR, they’ll dismiss your arguments as racist. If you cite a black author, then they have to debate you.

donkey butt arrogant Gates

Gates is a jackass arrogant pos who thinks he is above the law and should have been arrested and thrown in jail by the cops for disorderly conduct and impersonating a human being. Their biggest problem is arrogance and cockiness these days. What a joke they are.
Of course they owned slaves. They are lying hypocrites if they say otherwise. Indians were big time slave owners too especially the Cherokee tribes.

the real root

Did black people own slaves by Root? The real “root” was white slave traders bought tens of millions of black slaves off African tribal chiefs. Where did Gates mention that? And thank G-d for white slave traders as otherwise there would not be a single black in the west had it not been for them and the slave owning chiefs selling their rejects.

Free Travel For blacks

WE DO OWE BLACKS FOR BRINGING THEM HERE:

We need to do the right thing.

We need to offer EVERY black who feels mistreated in America a FREE one way ticket back to Africa along with $25,000 cash money.

All they need to do to qualify is Renounce Their U.S. Citizenship which they do not seem to appriciate and sign documents that they will never return to the USA, with very serious consequences if they do, not free housing, health care and welfare like we give our “South of The Border invaders (sic) but serious time on a Chain Gang before Deportation.

At $25,000 each we will be coming our billions of dollars ahead.

Few people know it costs $50,000 a year to keep a black incarcerated in prison.

Dede Anderson

You Do Realize That You are also Not native to America. Hence the Word Native Americans or The Indigenous People of America. Just as Africans were brought here, So were Europeans although most came. Which would mean Technically You do not OWN or have any rights to America, only the Native/Indigenous People that were here way before Columbus So Called Discovered it, Would have the so Called rights to America. So if your giving out tickets to Africa, Give yourself one as well and head back to Europe.

HamletsGhost

This information will remain buried like all other instances of blacks’ true nature, because it doesn’t fit the bill of “Blacks good, whites bad” that young people have drummed into their heads daily.

I read about blacks’ ownership of slaves a long time ago and also heard the excuse that they did it to “protect” their family members from whites. But on closer inspection, it doesn’t really hold up. If slaves were freed legally, they could enjoy the same legal protection that their equally free family members already enjoyed. What law worked for one would also protect the other.

More likely is the fact that by owning their family, blacks could more easily control them. Looking at black family dynamics today, there seems to be a surfeit of controlling behavior, jealousy, and physical abuse. What better way for a black man to keep his woman from leaving him and his children obedient than to legally own them and have the right to whip them or sell them if they got too “uppity”.

There was a book published on this subject in the early 1990s, before it became so political, or at least as tainted as the subject is now called “Black Masters.” I kick myself for not getting a copy back then.

MarkLuger

Who cares if black guys had to work and live with black women 100’s of years ago/? My race dropped napalm on Dresden for no reason, does anyone cry about that?? All we hear is waaaa, I’s had to work and libs wif a black woman, waaaa.

My feeling is that the whole history of slavery is one that is very problematic to understand or right about.

Think about it this way…100 years from now, if there are still people around to document our times, they will no doubt see that many black people were in prison. And they will wonder…those people were so racist, so evil, so cruel, so barbaric as to have these enormous prisons, and people kept in them! And they will have museums where people will go and you and the kids can take a picture where you are “behind bars” or something like that.

But of course, from our perspective, we know the truth. We lock up rapists and murderers and drug dealers! And black people happen to be those things!

It’s like when you hear about lynchings, and everybody today, in our “enlightened” age thinks it was horrific and those poor blacks and those evil southerners, etc. But many of those lynchings were for criminal, violent activity! The townspeople were actually just protecting themselves, keeping themselves safe.

It’s sort of the same with slavery. No doubt many aspects of it were bad. But, also, alot of those blacks had it much better than they would have had it belonging to some tribe in Africa.

Ross Kardon

Why did free blacks own slaves? To work in their fields, plantations, mines, factories, workshops, and other purposes, just like any white slave owner.

How would the public, both blacks and whites, react if a mainstream movie, or prime time TV mini-series about American slavery were made, in which the “massa” himself is a free black man? For example, I remember back in 1977, the release of the TV mini-series “Roots” caused serious racial problems. It was not until recently, I learned that “Roots” was plagiarized by Alex Haley from the Harold Courtlander novel “The African”.

Of course, most people do not study history on their own like I do for a hobby, and are very prone to believing about history what they have learned in school, see in movies, and on TV dramas, which is often historically inaccurate.

It was black Africans themselves who originated the black slave trade. Simply put, one tribe would raid the village of an enemy tribe and sell the people they caught to white merchant ship captains off the coast of Africa. After 1808, slave trading from the United States was technically illegal, but there were still slave smuggling ships from the United States up until the Civil War, because of the money to be made.

Unfortunately, slavery is still going on today, Now it is called, human trafficking. Organizations like Free the Slaves, and other human rights groups, are modern-day abolitionists who are now fighting it. But this makes me wonder, what if a benefit fundraiser to fight human trafficking was held at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, NYC?

slavery a bad economic system

Africans were the original slave owners. Sneaky tribal chief con artists sold tens of millions of their rejects most who were captives or inferiors in the tribe. Otherwise they would have been cannibalized. Foolish white slaves trader merchants sucked into the gimmick shipped them west and of course the western elite were gullible to fall for this trick when slaves were needed like a hole in the head and the worst of economy systems. These white Shem race Europeans could have enslaved the migrant Asian mongoloid Japheth race who had crossed over the Bering ice bridge 1000 yrs earlier but were tricked into going to Africa and buying the Ham servant race as they were called in the Torah’s Genesis. It was a heb Rothchilde trick.
Since his parents were missionarys to Japan where he got hooked on the yellow mongoloid pagans Amren’s Taylor was obviously a rebel like all offspring of these types. The preachers daughter or son was always the wild child when unchained. This is why he rejects any white man religion controvery discussion and protects so called hebs who have a disconnect with WMR although missionary’s all have a superiority complex when it comes to their belief system.. In the end slavery was the worst eco system and opened the door to Marx and his tool Lincoln. The rest is bloody history and inferior genetics.

G. Carter Woodson is such a BSer on this point. To “own” someone as a matter of “benevolence” toward your kinfolk. Pure crap! If one were “benevolent” one would buy and then immediately release and free forever (“emancipate”) one’s family member. The fact that the kept them as slaves long enough to have them listed on a decennial census puts the lie to that. Black americans bought and sold slaves for the same reasons black africans always have: to make money! Black in Haiti keep slaves to this very day for the same reason: they are cheap exploitable labor. Google “restavek”.

Sherman_McCoy

If blacks were treated as they deserve, in terms of criminal prosecutions, television depictions, report of their inferior IQ’s, the real reasons they cannot keep up with whites in school, then I would not hate them nearly as much as I do. The denial of reality is what turns people into extremists, not fair treatment.

ladyL

I am interested to know examples of the treatment blacks deserve. I am also interested as to why. Thank you!

gates is a pos

Gates is one useless lying arrogant pos who unquestionably came from one of the worst rejected inferior lines in Africa who were the first to be sold and board the western bound ship by tribal chiefs snickering and trying to hold back their laughter while signing a big relief to have his kind purged completely. Clearly Gates was the original Kunte Kinte but not the Hollywood fiction and only a wimpy runt bed wetter.

guest

Did blacks own black slaves 150+ years ago? YES.

Do blacks own black slaves in the United States, right now, today? ALSO YES!

When visiting Louisiana years ago I took a tour of an old plantation and was surprised to find out that the slave owner was a brown skinned woman. She was Creole, which is a mixture of African, Indian, and European, in some cases. If you ask ten Louisianans what a Creole is, you will get ten different answers. In either case, Laura looks Indian. Some of the family members are of French descent, so apparently they were not against intermarriage between the races.

Well,
I’ll be darned. Black people exploiting other Buh-lacks. Hey, wait a minute.
Aren’t 99% of pimps and heroin dealers in and to the Schwartz menschen Black?
Oh, honky Whitey made me do it, somehow connected with slavery and past
exploitation.

Patrick Boyle

Slavery of course was a universal economic strategy. It is not just restricted to humans much less just whites. Social insects also raid other colonies and steal slaves. Human slavery began probably with the neolithic revolution. Hunter-gatherers can’t take slaves out on hunting parties but slaves are valuable as soon as you invent agriculture.
So the black activist Gates chooses to state that blacks owned slaves in the US, implying that they only did so because they were imbeded in a white slave culture. But blacks also had slavery back in Africa. They probably got slavery later than Europeans because they got agriculture later.
Gates wants to associate whiteness with slave owning but it is more true to say that whiteness is associated with ending slavery. Gates is a bigot.

Pelagian

Is there a good history of slavery going back to biblical times that offers a defense of 19th century American slavery? Or at least a good contextualization of it? I want to read-up. Thanks.

slavery was a bad mistake

Slavery was a catastrophic mistake and needed like a hole in the head. Did the slave traders and slave buyers really and truly think this whole thing out before they jumped into it head first getting suckered by the tribal chiefs getting rid of their rejects conning them off on the white man who paid as much as 50,000 in todays dollars for every single slave to do incredibly easy soft labor 8-12 months out of the year picking cotten or cleaning house while getting everything paid for and the biggest part getting out of that god awful wretched hellhole jungle 3rd world existence?

Clearly they were happy to get away from the stench of the jungle otherwise they would have all returned to that wretched hellhole Africa in 1821 with Liberia or in 1865 or other times.

Blacks in America need to get on ther hands and knees and kiss the feet of the white elite for taking out of hellish African savage misery and bringing them into the light and same for the Europeans who colonized the African jungles and upgraded their lives.

No wonder the free slaves in 1865 showed their affection and eternal appreciation keeping the last names of their former owners and even gong to work for them for wages. They certainly never returned to Africa where they were not wanted.

Dont believe all the revisionist lies about abuse of slaves as they were treated with respect and dignity otherwise not a single reparation lawsuit was ever filed by an ex-slave and they still carry the surnames of their master to this day in 2013. Why do they give the tribal chiefs a free pass who sold them off and of course they owned slaves.

Ever heard of white slavery? White slaves built and maintained Europe for thousands of years. That should have never ended. Whites never needed black slaves for anything. It was the worst of the worst economic systems and opened the door for satanic Marx. Had blacks remained in Africa they would be happy. Ignorance is bliss.

MikeofAges

Nobody want to remember that human beings once lived in the real world. You ate what you grew, raised, gathered or hunted. Or didn’t eat at all. Anything you had that was made was made by someone you could see with your own eyes, or at someone like the people you could see in your daily world. People want to believe things that are not real because they want to live in a mental world which is not real, but want to believe that it is real. If you want to believe in a false present and false future, then you need a false past to go with it. If people wanted to live in the real world, they’d be yelling for job, any reasonable job, and a paycheck at the end of the week. Then, again, in the world today, maybe it makes more sense to yell for a bigger handout. Worldwide, the economic system seems incapable of creating jobs.

You never hear about slavery of White Europeans along the Barbary Coast (North Africa). Sex slave trade for White women does not leave enough shock to these PC scholars. White males were shipped off to the quarries if captured through raids. So-called scholars claim it’s not racism since Whites only have the power to oppress non-Whites. They must assume that all Europeans were rich from stolen wealth.

saxonsun

Yes, the Arabs took about a million whites into slavery–they devastated many parts of Europe. You never hear about it. Also, whites were considered stupid by the Arabs and less valuable. Talk about racism.

American Patriot

Lets not forget that the vast bulk of the slave catchers & sellers in Africa were African……and that slavery when finally stamped out in Africa by the Brits returned full force after 1960 once the White Man put his burden of civilizing the uncivilisable down. BTW, slavery has never left the areas ruled by moslems.

Shhh .. keep it quiet ok? Tribal chiefs who sold off all the slaves to the white man owned a billion slaves too and still do …

Fed Up

What neither liberals nor Blacks will admit: Slavery would have ended by the beginning of the 20th Century. If only for the simple reason slavery stacked the deck against Whites who did not own slaves of their own. Because a White worker could not compete effectively wage-wise against a slave doing the same job.

saxonsun

He had an article–can’t remember where–that castigated blacks for refusing to see the truth about their precious ancestors selling them.

JD

Read the book , the politically incorrect guide to the south and why it will rise again, The author makes a lot of good points on slavery. Such as, the first person to ever legally own a slave in America was a black man named Anthony Johnson, some of the largest slave owners were blacks, whites did not mistreat their slaves, just like they dont mistreat there property today. They were only whipped or hung if they had commited a crime, just like they do still today, in Africa.

lugnut

Freed black slaves mostly in La and the north had to pay to buy their relatives and others from white slave owners. Many people mistakenly assume black people owned slaves, because they found their names on bills of sale. Just because their names of people whose freedom they purchased were found on bills of sale, doesn’t mean they were slave owners, or they treated them as slaves.. Where do you think all these “black slave owners” would live anyway? There were only 135 free black people in the entire south at different times and they were mostly the offspring of their owners, their white fathers. Most were freed by their white fathers leading up to the civil war. Many wills would states, if they died, their mixed children would be freed. Blacks couldn’t own anything in the south during slavery. It wasn’t until after around 1880 before blacks could have the land left to them by their white fathers. I may be among the few who actually spent many hours talking to a former slave and i learned through her the real truth. She was one of them.

lugnut

Oh, this is a kluxer confederate revisionist article. Your forefathers brought slaves here, because there couldn’t do the jobs themselves. Everything you have, even today, slaves did that, slaves built the foundation of this country and without my ancestors, you’d still be dirt poor. And the fact is, your ancestors were child molesters. When i did my DNA and African American research, nearly all of the little black girls were around the age of 13 when they gave birth to the owner’s babies. That means, the owners started messing with them earlier than 13. The average age of bed wenches ( just an excuse to get a small child in their beds) was from 8 to 13 years old. By the end of the civil war, most of what was the black slaves, had white in them. Some southern heritage huh?

“This Is How We Do It” singer Montell Jordan insists he’s no deadbeat taxpayer — telling TMZ, he’s already paid his $617,000 tax bill … the money just hasn’t made its way into the pockets of the IRS … yet.

TMZ broke the story, the IRS filed a Federal Tax Lien against Jordan recently, claiming the singer still owes $617,987.06 in back taxes from 1999-2001.

But it’s not so cut and dry. Montell tells TMZ he paid the debt years ago by selling his music catalog, but the money’s been sitting frozen in an account administered by the U.S. Trustee Program, a division of the Department of Justice that oversees bankruptcy cases.

Montell filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and says he’s still disputing some of the IRS penalties he’s incurred. He expects the money to be released to the IRS in a few weeks when he settles negotiations over the penalties, at which point the case will be closed.

Brinkley says in a statement the lien was a “result of an error” and pledges it will be paid in full by Wednesday, December 6th.

Brinkley says she regrets not paying more attention to her accounting. She says she’s been focused on her parents, who are dealing with “serious health issues.”

THE HEART OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL

What is it with logos and rebrands? They cause such unnecessary stress. Some poor, pleasant bloke with a beard and a massive pair of headphones quietly arranges a few artwork files, adds some copy and reveals it to the world – it triggers the default seven day hysteria zone of anger, debate and piss-taking in social media.

At first glance it appeared that the English Defence League had re-branded under the leadership of Michael Dawson and Stephen Warnock, but having put that to bed, there is a lot to be intrigued by the move. Now that the hysteria window has closed, I think it’s time to give the lads at Futurebrand a break.

The English domestic game is in rude financial health, and the EFL should take great pride in developing a league with the fourth largest attendance in the world. There is talk in the press release about global identity, stakeholders, focus groups, having meetings with Johnstone’s Paints about it – but the heart of it is the opening quote.

""The new EFL name rightly emphasises the central role our clubs play at the heart of English professional football,” says Shaun Harvey. Quite right too.

We like leaving our houses and watching football in the fresh air with our own eyes. Can we do it at Rochdale on a Tuesday night? Unequivocally yes. Football clubs are at the heart of local communities, supported by local people. There is pride, a shared identity, a warmth from simply being together in the English Football League that is to be cherished. The heart of English professional football is a lovely, and accurate turn of phrase.

Of course though, it’s hard not to discuss the English Football League without bringing the Barclays Premier League into the fold. As a Queens Park Rangers fan, I feel highly qualified to comment on the club’s relationship with both.

Here we have a club with a fanbase essentially stretching in a thin strip from Ladbroke Grove to Heathrow, and a crowd of 18,000. Fans of the club are at their happiest when the team is passing the ball, playing attacking attractive football, the players are smiling and the shirt has a clear, broad blue hoop. That is it. With that approach they won the Championship in 2011, and that strip of West London smiled. A local joyful experience that had nationwide moment in the sun.

Yet the promised-land is the global multinational Barclays Premier League, where clubs are owned by oligarchs, sovereign funds and betting firms that happen to be located in Leicester or Stoke. As those clubs become global commodities, they risk a fraying of ties between fans and communities, something the Premier League are acutely aware of.

The more money gets made selling shirts in Malaysia, the more disingenuous the ‘clubs in the community’ initiatives can appear. Without depth and graft, they have all the faux-empathy of a community pinboard in your local, global conglomerate, Starbucks.

Roughly 35 chairmen will use the phrase “take our rightful place in the Barclays Premier League,” in their programme notes; mistakenly thinking fans only care about success. We want to win. We want to be on Match of the Day each weekend. It’s nice to have the grandeur and the status. But it is not as important as the shared identity and love of the club, wherever it finds itself.

But you can’t fall deeply in love without the highs and lows. The heart of English football pumping vigorously through the English Football League makes all of football’s vital organs function better – so flat caps off to them, and good luck.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Bollywood Fashion Focus at IIFA

Many Bollywood stars are set to prowl the catwalk at the International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) Fashion Extravaganza in Bangkok on June 7th.

Vidya Balan will promote Sabyasachi’s fashion line whilst Kareena Kapoor will front the designs of Manish Malhotra. Ayesha Takia, Aftab Shivdasani, and Riteish Deshmukh co-stars in the movie De Taali will be seen in the creations of Vikram Phadnis and Priyanka Chopra and Harman Baweja, who next will be seen in Love Story 2050 will model for Rohit Bal.

Shriya Saran and Shweta Bharadwaj, along with Zayed Khan and Vivek Oberoi from Mission Instanbul will also be promoting the movie on the ramp. Plus the cast of the upcoming Acid Factory will strut their stuff as well.

Proceeds of the event will go to the IIFA foundation, a charity set up by the academy to support families of the film industry workers who are facing difficulties.

The IIFA will also be launching IIFA Bling at the event. This is a new fashion line produced in association with BIBA, which will have clothes designed in the style worn by the stars in Bollywood movies. “The brand is a wonderful way for movie fans to experience stardom.

"Why I Can't Wait for Meghan McCain and Michael Ian Black's Book

When was the last time you saw Democrats and Republicans uniting in the name of comedy? Sarah Palin on SNL? (That was awkward.) Stephen Colbert at Bush’s White House Press Correspondents’ dinner? (Very, very awkward.) It doesn’t usually work…until maybe now.

Conservative blogger and author Meghan McCain is teaming up with lefty comedian Michael Ian Black to write a book called Stupid for America. Fer real. It’s going to be a road trip across the country—of course!—to talk to everyday Americans about why the system is “f-ed up.” Their publisher likens the duo to “Chelsea Handler and Hunter S. Thompson.” Don’t really get the Hunter comparison, but whatever—sounds hilarious!

Really, though, I’m weirdly excited for this book. Not because I want to see the two sides “find common ground” to bring back “civil discourse.” Not even because I’m a huge fan of either author—although I think it’s bad-ass that McCain has been on Maddow a few times, and I did love Black on “Adult Swim.”

It’s more that this book signals a kind of generational shift—younger people understand that political conversations can be playful, adventurous, and not always knee-jerk. More cynically: when it comes to politics, our culture of celebreality is the ultimate peacemaker. Comedians have been ribbing the other side since forever, but they usually don’t have the balls to crack jokes to each other’s faces. Perhaps this is our moment?

Out of the two, McCain particularly fascinates me. People have called her a RINO (Republican In Name Only). And given her stances on everything from gay rights to feminism, she may very well break with a party that has trouble supporting her social beliefs. But her work—and especially this pairing—serves as a reminder that the loudest GOP voices nowadays are, well, old. And stubborn. And super-serious. And pretty damn extreme. From the House of Reps to the Tea Party, conservative twentysomethings get ignored, especially ones with senses of humor.

Granted, there are armies of young evangelical Christians—we heard that loud and clear in ""Jesus Camp"" and books like Lauren Sandler's Righteous. But there are also a lot of conservative young people, regardless of political affiliation, who aren’t zealots. Our generation, both on the left or right, simply skews more socially liberal when it comes to things like immigration, gay marriage, and balanced parenting.

Salon’s Rebecca Traister said this when defending Tina Fey: ""Ideology and political purity are frequently the enemies of all that is hilarious in the world.” Something tells me that Meghan and Michael get that.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Scientists have proved that even the most seemingly innocent chat with a woman can be enough to send male sex hormones soaring.

A team from the University of Chicago paid students to come into their lab under the pretence of testing their saliva chemistry.

While there, the students got to chat to a young female research assistant.

Saliva tests showed the brief interaction was enough to raise testosterone levels by as much as 30%.

The more a man's hormone level shot up, the more attractive he later admitted to finding the research assistant.

And perhaps more tellingly, the research assistant herself was able to identify those men who found her attractive.

The men who she judged to be doing the most to try to impress her proved to be those who registered the biggest jump in testosterone levels.

However, little or no change was detected in the saliva of students who chatted with other men.

Animal reaction

Testosterone has long been closely linked with the male libido.

The researchers say their work is the first time that hard evidence has been produced in this way.

It is known that the release of testosterone in animals can embolden them, triggering courtship or aggressive behaviour.

The Chicago team believe the same may be true in humans.

However, lead researcher Dr James Roney said it was also possible that the release of the hormone was stimulated by a stress reaction.

Dr Roney told BBC News Online: ""The findings are consistent with the existence of brain mechanisms that are specialised for the regulation of courtship behaviour and thus respond to cues from potential mates with coordinated behavioural and hormonal reactions.

""One might call these reactions components of a ""mating response"" which, if confirmed by future research, could be as basic and significant as, say, the well-known ""fight or flight"" reaction.""

Dr Nick Neave, of the Human Cognitive Neuroscience Unit at Northumbria University, said the study was ""very interesting"".

""Other researchers have found changes in male hormone levels after watching erotic movies but this seems to be the first that has attempted to assess hormone changes when males meet women on a more 'normal' level.""

Dr Benjamin Campbell, an expert in anthropology at Boston University, said it was possible that testosterone made men more bold by suppressing activity in an area of the brain called the amygdala, which controls the stress reaction.

Testosterone levels peak in a man by his early twenties, and then gradually diminish.

Men who are married or in long-term relationships have lower testosterone levels than those still playing the field.

The research is published in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"What we learned from Thursday's preseason games

Week 2 of the NFL preseason kicked off with a trio of interesting games that provided more developments in the three-way Jets quarterback race, Tom Brady's debut and an injury to the reigning Super Bowl MVP. Thursday's games also featured the second chapter in the Packers' backup QB duel, Mason Rudolph's first start and more injuries to the Redskins' running back corps.

1. Tom Brady showed midseason form, leading the offense to 20 points in the first half while completing 19 of 26 passes for 172 yards, two touchdowns and a 116.2 passer rating. James White garnered the majority of the playing time at running back, with Phillip Dorsett, Cordarrelle Patterson and Eric Decker mixing in as complements to Julian Edelman and Chris Hogan at wide receiver. If there's a problem area on the offensive line, it's right tackle. Filling in for injured veteran Marcus Cannon, first-round rookie Isaiah Wynn was forced out of the game with a left ankle injury of his own.

On the other side of the ball, rookie linebacker Ja'Whaun Bentley stood out for the second consecutive week. The fifth-round pick has a chance to enter the season as a starter next to Dont'a Hightower.

2. Nick Foles' 2018 preseason debut didn't exactly go as scripted. The reigning Super Bowl MVP was knocked out of the game with a strained shoulder, sustained on a strip sack that went for a Patriots touchdown early in the second quarter. A rusty Foles took three sacks and showed scattershot accuracy in his 18 minutes of action. He's expected to undergo further testing Friday on the shoulder. It will be interesting to see which quarterback is under center for next week's regular-season audition versus the Browns.

3. The Jets not only have the league's most captivating quarterback battle, but also quite the conundrum for Week 1. Sam Darnold entered Thursday night's game with a tailwind of momentum, the future of the franchise riding a wave of optimism after a promising preseason debut. By the start of the fourth quarter, however, it had become harder and harder to ignore the fact that Teddy Bridgewater has outplayed him for two straight weeks. Meanwhile, incumbent starter Josh McCown has played just one series this preseason, leaving his role a mystery. There might not be a more impactful preseason bout than next week's crosstown showdown between the Jets and Giants.

4. Slimmed-down running back Rob Kelley has a new lease on life after entering training camp in a fight for a roster spot. After losing rookie Derrius Guice to an ACL tear last week, the Redskins saw power back Samaje Perine go down with an ankle injury Thursday night. Meanwhile, Kelley has started both preseason games and was the focal point of the first-team offense versus the Jets, touching the ball eight times before exiting.

Don't sleep on undrafted wide receiver Cam Sims, who led the team with 75 receiving yards in the preseason opener. Sims had an up-and-down performance Thursday night, but showed tantalizing playmaking ability at 6-foot-5.

5. Mason Rudolph didn't have to wait long for his welcome to the NFL moment against the Packers. The rookie quarterback threw a pick-six on his first passing attempt of the game -- a pass Packers cornerback Tramon Williams probably saw coming even before it left Rudolph's hand. Rudolph's only response was a rueful grin as he helplessly watched Williams zip 25 yards to the end zone.

After a solid debut last week, reality hit hard for the former Oklahoma State standout. Rudolph struggled to find rhythm and was hampered by inconsistent offensive line play. Outside of a 19-yard pass to Justin Hunter, Rudolph's 5 of 12 passing for 47 yards was mostly of the dink-and-dunk variety. He's still a contender for the Steelers backup QB spot (Mike Tomlin gave Landry Jones the night off), but Pittsburgh probably wants to see a lot more from its third-round pick next week.

Joshua Dobbs had a better overall game than Rudolph against the Packers' second- and third-level defense. He completed 12 of 18 passes for 192 yards, 2 TDs and an interception.

6. Packers linebacker Reggie Gilbert put in quite a performance in his bid for more playing time in 2018. The third-year linebacker, who spent most of last season on Green Bay's practice squad before a late-season promotion, tried to do his best one-man wrecking crew impersonation. Gilbert terrorized Rudolph for 2.5 sacks and recorded three tackles. He'll need similar stat lines in order to challenge for regular-season snaps, but he's looking very good to retain his roster spot.

7. How about those Packers tight ends? We got a demitasse-sized taste of what the Aaron Rodgers-Jimmy Graham combination will look like on a 8-yard TD pass, but there were a slew of other encouraging performances. Lance Kendricks caught a pair of passes for 28 yards, Robert Tonyan had two catches for 15 yards and a TD and Marcedes Lewis made a 23-yard catch.

"Kenny Shiels leaves Kilmarnock managers post

11 June 2013 01:55

Kenny Shiels has left Kilmarnock with immediate effect by mutual consent, the Scottish Premier League club have confirmed.

The departure of the 57-year-old Northern Irishman comes as no surprise following days of speculation about his future.

Killie finished ninth in the Clydesdale Bank Premier League but a four-match ban handed to Shiels last week following outspoken media comments - two of which were suspended - was also taken into consideration by the club.

The statement read: ""The Club thanks Kenny for his service over the last three years, firstly as assistant to Mixu Paatelainen, thereafter as interim manager and subsequently as manager.

""His tenure as manager was marked most notably by the Club's League Cup success in March, 2012 and his place in the Club's history is thereby assured. Back to back victories over Rangers in season 2011-12 and a historic win at Celtic Park in season 2012-13 will live on in the memory of the Club's supporters.

""Kenny's work ethic and his determination to introduce young players into the first team were evident throughout his time with the Club.

""Unfortunately season 2012-13 saw the Club exit the League Cup at the first hurdle and go on to record our poorest home record since season 1980-81, culminating in seven matches without a victory at Rugby Park to exit the Scottish Cup and miss out on the 'top six' and then drop to ninth place with five defeats in our final six SPL fixtures.

""A difficult relationship with the Scottish F.A. resulted in several touch-line bans and recent comments regarding a fellow SPL club and the Scottish F.A. Judicial Panel incurred a further suspension which would have seen Kenny commence next season in the stand, rather than the dug-out. As a result, the Club was also prosecuted by the Judicial Panel's Compliance Officer at a hearing on June 6 and will discover the penalty to be imposed on June 21.

""For these reasons, both footballing and regulatory, it was mutually agreed that his contract as manager should end. The Club wishes Kenny every success in the future and thanks him for delivering the League Cup to Rugby Park in 2012.""

Shiels landed himself in trouble after claiming Celtic were ""the monster of Scottish football"" following a spat with Neil Lennon, after the Celtic boss bemoaned the fact none of his players had been nominated for the PFA Scotland player of the year award.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Illegal Alien Gang Member Wanted For Murder Caught In Va.

WOODBRIDGE, VA (Newsweek) – After a long manhunt of an alleged MS-13 gang member, FBI officials announced Saturday they had finally apprehended Walter Yovany Gomez.

Gomez, an illegal immigrant from Honduras, had been listed on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list in connection to the 2011 murder of a fellow MS-13 member.

Authorities found Gomez living in Woodbridge, Virginia, about 20 miles away from Washington D.C., and arrested him on Friday following a well-coordinated investigation and help from the public. Following his capture, Special Agent Timothy Gallagher, who heads the FBI’s Newark Office, said in a statement that Gomez will stand trial for his “alleged involvement in a brutal murder which took a young man from his family,” according to Fox News.

Walter Yovany Gomez is wanted for his alleged involvement in the murder of a man in Plainfield, New Jersey, in May 2011. The victim was suspected of socializing with a rival gang and had been ordered to be killed by MS-13 leaders. It is alleged that Gomez and another gang member, after an evening of socializing with the victim, attacked him. The victim was struck in the head numerous times, had his throat cut, and was stabbed 17 times in the back.

“The apprehension of Walter Yovany Gomez is a prime example of the close coordination between the vigilant public and the hard working men and women of law enforcement,” Gallagher said.

Gomez was first put on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list back in April, with the department offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to his arrest.

Now that Gomez has been apprehended, Gallagher said he faces extradition to New Jersey for his role in the death of Julio Matute. Gomez, who had been reported at a party in Plainfield that Matute also attended the night of his death, was accused of beating the man with a baseball bat, stabbing him 17 times with a knife and then slitting his throat with a screwdriver.

Gomez had almost been caught by authorities back in 2011 during a police chase following Matute’s death. However, he managed to get away after jumping out of a second story window.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Sent to Bath and North East Somerset Council 2 minutes later

This problem was reported to Fix My Street in September 2016 and nothing has been done about it. The Drain and now several more farther up the road are completely blocked with silt, so that when it rains the water comes out a drain higher up the road and flows down the road and floods.

Still open, via questionnaire, 11:59, Tue 14 November 2017

This drain and several others have been blocked for over a year when it was first reported on fix my street ,and no action was taken then. I also reported it to Council Connect in October and still no action.

Posted by Tony Parfitt at 11:59, Tue 14 November 2017

The problem of the one drain was fixed but the bigger issue is that most of the drains farther up the hill are also totally blocked as they have been for the past year. The action at this present time that has been worked on has only helped to stop flooding in this area, water still flows down the hill on the surface of the road , this is not going to be safe when it freezes, my concern is that this is the rout for the local school coaches.

July 17, 2007Don started his major league career with the Yankees in 1934, spending four seasons in the Bronx as a utility player. He was traded to the St. Louis Browns before the 1938 season and was a regular in St. Louis for four seasons, mainly at second base and sometimes at shortstop. He also had brief stops with the Philadelphia A's and Detroit Tigers.

Heffner was a successful minor league manager for about ten years starting in 1947, then joined the Kansas City A's as a coach in 1958. He moved to Detroit as a coach in 1961, then went back to managing in the minors the next two seasons. Don was hired by the Mets and was their third base coach in 1964 and 1965.

of late.)

The highlight of this time educationally
though was our stop in Kusadasi, Turkey from which we visited Ephesus, the best
preserved (or rather reconstructed) ancient Roman city. They have only uncovered 10% of the city as
of this time (they are still digging) but it is remarkably clear walking
through what it must have been like in the early centuries BC. Many homes had running water and heated
floors. My favorite part was the public
toilets – no privacy!

Look how crowded it is - they are all tourists

The Greek ports were less
educational but very nice days out. I
was a sucker for all the cats.

This little girl was making a killing - she stopped every couple of minutes

to stuff the money from the cup into her pocket.

OK, I might have been feeding them.

Always happy when we find these.

All in all the cruise was a really nice break from our trip. We surely gained back a bit of the weight we'd lost, and we all agreed the time went by really fast. Still though we were ready to get off the boat by the time we landed in Rome. There we had just one day to cram in all the sites before catching a plane to London. Our guide was great though (hired by Dad - thanks Dad!) and so we got to see an awful lot. It was Sunday though so we missed the Sistine Chapel. Wilder and Peyton thought one day in Italy was a complete rip off, but I told them they'd be back one day.

The Spanish Steps

The last time I was in Rome it was summer and hot. It was beautiful in November with much fewer tourists. Now though - we hear London calling!",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The MKE 600 is the ideal video camera/camcorder microphone able to handle even demanding filmic challenges. Due to its high directivity, the MKE 600 picks up sounds coming from the direction in which the camera is pointing and effectively attenuates noise coming from the sides and rear. The switchable “Low Cut” filter additionally minimizes wind noise.
Because some video cameras/camcorders do not provide phantom power, the MKE 600 can also be battery powered. A battery on/off switch prevents the battery from discharging prematurely; “Low Batt” is displayed.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Thames Basin Heaths Special Protection Area (SPA) - around Farnham

The Thames Basin Heaths SPA covers an area of 8,275 ha across Hampshire, (the former county of) Berkshire and Surrey. It is part of a complex of heathlands in Southern England that support important populations of breeding birds, including the Dartford Warbler, Nightjar and Woodlark. More general information on SPAs is available from Natural England.

Only a small part of the SPA (about 80 ha) lies within Waverley, north of Farnham. There is, however, a “Zone of Influence” around the SPA within which measures are required to avoid adverse impacts on its conservation interests. This ‘buffer zone’ extends from 400 metres to 5 km from the perimeter of the SPA and covers most of the built-up area of Farnham.

The SPA Avoidance Strategy

The Thames Basin Heaths Avoidance Strategy was adopted in December 2009 and updated in May 2013. Consultation on a further review took place in March / April 2016 and the revised strategy was adopted by the Council on 19 July 2016. It sets out the Council’s approach in seeking to avoid the effect of a net increase in population from new housing developments within 5km of the SPA, and how it proposes to discharge its legal obligations under the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2010.

The Strategy provides guidance to developers on the level of avoidance measures that the Council expects to see incorporated within planning applications. In this instance, “avoidance measures” means providing or contributing towards Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANG), and contributing towards a programme of strategic access management and monitoring (SAMM) of the SPA.

In accordance with the Avoidance Strategy, where applicants cannot provide their own SANG (on- or off-site), they will be required to pay a tariff to contribute towards the enhancement of existing SANGs, where such sites have been identified by the local authority. Waverley's only current SANG resource is at Farnham Park.

The SANG capacity at Farnham Park is a finite resource in terms of the numbers of new dwellings it can support. The remaining (unallocated) capacity is monitored continually and the latest position can be viewed below.

In the event of there being insufficient capacity to support proposals for residential development, and unless applicants can provide or secure alternative SANG in accordance with the Avoidance Strategy, permission will be refused.

Financial contributions to the enhancement of the Farnham Park SANG will be secured through an appropriate Section 106 Unilateral Undertaking. This must be completed before the Council can grant planning permission.

Note: Within 400m of the perimeter of the SPA, the impact of additional residential development is deemed to be such that it is not possible to conclude no adverse effect on the SPA. There is, therefore, a presumption against development within this zone.

How much is the SANG tariff?

"How do you burn leaves? (A serious question!)

Riding through Wray castle yesterday I saw several piles of fallen leaves, slowly burning themselves to ashes. I've got hundreds and thousands of leaves here and I thought that burning them would be a good idea. Only problem is how to do it. Any one know? They only smoulder, probably because they are dampish, but how do you start the fire off, and then keep it going?

Perfectly true, but leaves take a minimum of 12 months to rot down, quite often longer, and in the meantime they have got to be stored somewhere. Can't leave them on the garden because that way environmentally unfriendly pests and diseases can be harboured. The ash contains lots of phosphates which helps to promote growth if mixed in with the compost heap.

We put ours in any old bin or fertiliser bags we have lying around. Pop a couple of holes in the side of the bags and tuck them away in a corner of the garden to be used as mulch or compost next year. The tomatoes came up a treat in it this summer.

you need a proper fire first, no leaves.
when its burnt down and there are some good embers, pile on the leaves, really pile them on the heavier and damper the better.
the embers will then smoulder for days from the inside producing minimal smoke.

Thanks SOO...I'm trying to clear leaves from 10 full grown horse chestnuts, two sycamores and three oak trees. So you can see that piling them up is not reasonable. I'm going to need a large trailer to take them to the tip, or 325,761 black bags to store them in. Burning seems the most practical solution.

If you have that many tress that size I'd just get them all in a corner somewhere and leave them to rot down - you clearly have more than enough space to do this and it woudl be entirely reasonable, imo.

Ski, Unfortunately the set up works against that. Most of the area under the trees is planted with evergreen shrubs/low growing conifers. Instructions are to keep them clear of fallen leaves. Not much room to stow leaves underneath. Some I do mow, and lawn cuttings mixed with chopped leaves do rot down quite quickly, and make a good mulch. Even if I mow the leaves there is still the storage issue, and as leaves on their own take more than a year to become serviceable compost, I need a lot of spare space which isn't available.

So, burning seems a good option. I know the townies and beardies don't understand, but that's life.

If your horse chestnuts are suffering from leaf miner (brown yellow tinge towards the end of the leaves from the middle of summer) the best thing for the trees health is to burn the leaves as it will reduce the infestation next year.

Otherwise I would advocate composting, you could save yourself a fortune on bark mulch.

My big horse chesnut has leaf miner - seems to cause it no problems whatsoever, masses of conkers this year! Each autumn I take about 10 bags of leaves to the tip, If I leave the on the lawn they kill the grass. My next door neighbour leaves the lot where they fall hence leaf miner back again by July...",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

5the best game that man has created

Still playing this game 325 hours in and still not bored and only done about three quest of the storyline. Wont bore you with the amount i could say cause this game is just so big and looks better than kiera knightley undressed get it now

5One of the greatest games of all time

A friend suggested I pick this up as he had spent the past year playing it on and off & it was now under £15. Being a tactics/Japanese RPG fan I really wasn't sure, but £15 isn't much of a risk these days. One hour in & all that was making me stay with it was Patrick Stewart's voice acting & the hope of some kind of adventure around the corner. Another 8 hours later, in the middle of the night, I realised I was hooked!

This game is immense - not just in the huge amount of quests and physical size of the game world, but in every sense this game is big. But don't let that put you off. You decide what to do. You decide when to do it, if you do it at all.

The character progression is so far beyond what I am used to playing JRPGs. The class you choose is only the start of it - you take this game & your character in the direction that suits you. I watched my friend play his game. He wears heavy armour, wields a huge claymore & wades in. The game has rewarded him by improving his attributes with upgrades & stat boosts that let him do all that more effectively. He's a good guy & goes around helping people out. His game world & game experience is totally different to mine. I'm a thief. I go out at night, take things from people's locked chests & do robberies to order for shady collectors & my guild's leader. I use stealth to make my way through dungeons under the noses of the bad guys. I don't need heavy armour, I have equipment that makes me harder to detect. I also have a side-line in killing people for money.

We're playing the same game but in very different ways & getting different things from it. He likes more action & adventure whereas I prefer stealth & tactics. This game lets you play how you want to play to a satisfying degree.

On no level does this game disappoint. Stick in there through the character creation & once you are let loose in Cyrodiil it's up to you what happens next.

5Seriously immersive gameplay

This is by far the best RPG available on the PS3 and the best i've ever played on any format. It's so completely immersive and open that you can play for weeks, perhaps months on end without even playing the main storyline as the world is so huge and there is so much else to do. Could lead to relationship problems as the game is so good!One thing, another reviewer mentioned a glitch regarding getting a cure after becoming a vampire, as the lady that makes your cure won't accept one of the ingredients (Bloodgrass). To solve this glitch, save your game then go to the PS3 System settings, change the language to German (Deutsch), load the disc again, load your game and for some reason the lady will accept the ingredient (Blutgrass) this time. Save your game, go back to change the PS3 system language settings to English - your game is not ruined and you'll have a cure for vampirism.Other than this glitch, the game is absolutely perfect. Enjoy!

5glitch

I love this game its one of my favorites ive had it for about 12 months but theres a major glitch with the game of the year version its somthing to do witrh the language translation (in to english) its to do with the vimpirism cure quest once all the ingredients have been gathered and u go to give them to the person who makes the potion she wont take the last ingredient therefore u cannot complete the quest so ur only option is to start all over again avoid getting bitten in the first place i didnt want to do this as id been playing 6 months however there is a way around it but it involves getting the basic copy of the game the one without the expansion and completeing the quest

"In two years, Dictator Donald Trump (DDT) has built a sewer of corruption, filled with wealthy men who acquired their riches as DDT did by cheating people. Early strong supporters justified his putrid behavior with “Give him a chance” or “I’m still waiting.” Some still cling to the belief that DDT is the Second Coming while others try to get off DDT’s ship.

Columnist Michelle Goldberg summarized DDT ‘s first two years in the Oval Office:

“Trump has turned out to be the Norma Desmond of authoritarians, a senescent has-been whose delusions are propped up by obsequious retainers. From his fantasy world in the White House, he barks dictatorial and often illegal orders, floats conspiracy theories, tweets insults and lies unceasingly. But much of the time he’s not fully in charge. He has the instincts of a fascist but lacks both the discipline and the loyal lieutenants he’d need to create true autocracy.

“The shutdown throws our crisis into high relief. For the first two years, Trump destroyed American norms, standards and conventions. Now he’s cavalierly destroying American lives.”

Fodder for DDT’s downfall:

Last night, Buzzfield raised eyebrows when it reported that DDT told his fixer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations for the Trump Tower Moscow. During his campaign, DDT said he had no business deals with Russia but arranged to meet in Russia with Vladimir Putin to jump-start the project. Cohen was also ordered to give DDT and his children Ivanka and Don Jr. detailed updates. Don Jr. also lied to Congress about his participation in the possible Trump hotel in Moscow. Witnesses revealed that the three participants in the negotiation lied when they said they had little knowledge about it. Mueller’s office stated that “specific statements … are not accurate.” DDT claims vindication, and the media questions which parts Mueller declares not accurate. Buzzfield reporting has not been wrong yet.

This past week, DDT’s sort-of lawyer Rudy Giuliani defended his boss but claimed the possibility of collusion between Russia and DDT’s campaign.

DDT may be meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un in February, but the Pentagon worries that DDT’s national security adviser John Bolton might start a war with Iran after he asked them “to provide the White House with military options to strike Iran” because a Shia militia fired rockets on a vacant lot near the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Former Defense Secretary James Mattis quashed the idea, but a long-time Boeing executive is now in charge of the Pentagon. Bolton’s request last year follows his long-term desire to “bomb Iran” while he wants to eradicate the United Nations.

After DDT raged about the news that the FBI investigated the possibility that he was a national security risk, officials reported that DDT concealed the records of his five largely secret meetings with Vladimir Putin, including confiscating interpreters’ notes and keeping them from discussing the meetings with other administration officials. DDT’s temper tantrum included at least six tweets early last Saturday morning from the White House with vicious baseless accusations against the New York Times, Hillary Clinton, James Comey, the FBI, and Robert Mueller. DDT did not deny the FBI report. Lack of records from the meetings violates federal laws.

Frequent threats from DDT to pull the U.S. out of NATO have expressed concerns about other countries not pulling their financial weight, but this action would be DDT’s gift to Putin. Michèle A. Flournoy, an under secretary of defense under President Obama, said that leaving NATO “would be one of the most damaging things that any president could do to U.S. interests” and “the wildest success that Vladimir Putin could dream of.” Retired Adm. James G. Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, said an American withdrawal from the alliance would be “a geopolitical mistake of epic proportion.” After annexing Crimea in 2014, Putin focused on separating the United States from Europe to give him control over the NATO countries. DDT first stopped former Defense Secretary James Mattis from attending the next NATO meeting and then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) from directly talking with NATO officials.

Mueller has turned his investigation to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), former head of the Intelligence Committee and fierce DDT defender long been suspected of leaking information to DDT. Nunes met with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and dozens of foreign officials at DDT’s Washington hotel on January 18, 2017, just two days before DDT’s inauguration before Nunes’ committee investigation opposed anyone investigating DDT and blocked subpoenas. During a fundraiser last summer, Nunes said that Republicans had to keep their House majority to protect DDT from Mueller.

Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) released a January 2017 DHS plan from a whistleblower connecting separation of migrant children from their parents as a deterrent to crossing the U.S.-Mexico border when the number was at an all-time low. Thousands more migrant children were separated from their parents than reported, and DHS had no plans for reunification. DHS recommended denying migrant children their legal right to asylum hearings, target parents for increased prosecutions, and require extensive background checks for sponsoring an unaccompanied migrant child to create a backlog of children forced into abusive facilities. Merkley requested an FBI perjury investigation into DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen’s congressional testimony that the department had no policy of separating children.

In the House, 136 GOP members voted against DDT in opposition to his removing sanctions from Putin’s friend Oleg Deripaska, an oligarch who paid millions of dollars to get DDT elected. Because 42 Republicans in the Senate had already voted to permit the lifting of sanctions, the House vote was symbolic, but 11 GOP Senators also voted against giving Putin this gift and allowing him to put more money into U.S. election interference. Senate Majority Leader supported DDT in giving the money back to Russia although he had called Deripaska a “thug.”

DDT’s trade war with China has problems: China’s 2018 trade surplus with the U.S. grew 17 percent in 2018, at $351.76 billion the largest U.S. deficit since 2006. The difference is actually larger because China doesn’t count goods that come to the U.S. from other countries.

Two years ago, DDT made his first speech after his inauguration. These are some of his failed promises since then:

Fixing poverty: No statistical drop in the U.S. official poverty rate from 2016 to 2017.

“New roads and high roads”: The failed plan in the GOP Congress was to stick states and cities with 80 percent of infrastructure costs—much higher than past years.

“Bring back our jobs … borders … wealth”: More coal mines closed in DDT’s first two years than President Obama’s first term; drop in soybean exports by 98 percent in 2018.

“No room for prejudice”: Growth of far-right extremism and far-right violence greatly increased in past two years after DDT’s expressions of bigotry.

“Education system flushed with cash”: Drastic cuts to Educational Department’s funding in DDT’s budget and public education deprioritized in favor of for-profit schools.

“All Americans never be ignored again”: Shutdown latest proof of DDT’s failure to keep this promise.

Before his inauguration, DDT made 663 promises, including 36 of them on the first day in office. He kept two of those—a hiring freeze on federal employees and a moratorium on new agency regulations—while breaking or ignoring the other 34, some of which might actually have helped people. In his first 100 days, he broke 80 promises he made before he was sworn in.

“He is a demagogue, a xenophobe, a sexist, a know-nothing, and a liar…. [He] expresses admiration for authoritarian rulers and evinces authoritarian tendencies himself…. [He] is easily goaded, a poor quality for someone seeking control of America’s nuclear arsenal. He is an enemy of fact-based discourse; he is ignorant of, and indifferent to, the Constitution; he appears not to read.”

In two years, DDT has alienated all the countries in Europe, Africa, North America, and Central America and many countries in Asia and the Middle East. His threats have put the United States close to nuclear war with North Korea and Iran. His multitude of executive orders are destroying the planet, causing bad health, and eliminating democracy in the United States. The Atlantic believes that its editorial two years ago was “guilty of understatement.” Those still waiting for DDT’s “better angels” to appear should read DDT’s 50 destructive events since his inauguration.

Since the shutdown, DDT’s approval rating has dropped and his disapproval rating surged with a seven-percent increase between the two. Much of the difference comes from the loss of his base—suburban men and white evangelicals. The poll’s director said that he sees a crack in DDT’s support for the first time.

Former Trump Organization executive vice president Barbara Res said about DDT, “I see him going into a corner, I see him scratching back like a cornered animal. I think he’s afraid.”

As the Republicans work to support Russia, they are joining Dictator Donald Trump (DDT) in his attack on FBI agent Bruce Ohr. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) traveled to London to dig up dirt on both Ohr and Christopher Steel, the British former agent who wrote a dossier on DDT, but officials at MI6, MI5, and GCHQ wouldn’t talk with him. Nunes finally managed a meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May’s deputy national security advisor, Madeline Alessandri. Ohr has been instrumental in fighting Russian organized crime for almost three decades, perhaps the reason that DDT wants to get rid of him because Ohr raised concerns about oligarch Oleg Deripaska named in contacts between DDT’s associates and Russia.

DDT might have been better off leaving Ohr alone. When Congress required Ohr to testify, he said that he learned from Christopher Steele that “Russian intelligence believed it had Donald Trump ‘over a barrel.’” DDT continues to claim that the Steele dossier was responsible for the FBI investigation into his Russian problem, but memos from both the GOP and Dems prove that the FBI had started the investigation earlier about Russian contacts of former DDT campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos before they had the Steele dossier. Ohr was not the original source of information. Ohr testified that DDT campaign aide Carter Page had met with more senior Russians official that Page admitted. DOJ officials Jeff Sessions and Rod Rosenstein had moved him from director of the Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Task Force, according to Ohr, because it concerned White House meetings and interactions.

The Republicans who wanted to surveil everyone in the United States are now criticizing Ohr because of his surveillance tactics.

Democratic members of the House are asking committee chairs to review how GOP representatives got correspondence between Ohr and Steele and why they failed to go through appropriate channels to introduce the emails, notes, and text messages into the official record before reading them out loud in the hearing. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) said that this information appears to have been cherrypicked by Devin Nunes (R-CA), excluding the complete correspondence. Nadler and Cummings also want “an immediate bipartisan meeting” with the DOJ to review “whether any ongoing investigations or human sources may have been compromised.”

Nunes is only one of many prominent Republicans to use the conspiracy-laden Big League Politics website using Q-Anon false theories for fundraising, some of the candidates violating campaign finance law. The website is being used to harass innocent small business by accusing them of operating child-sex trafficking rings, like the “Pizzagate” conspiracy against Hillary Clinton and a Washington, D.C. restaurant. Recent vicious targets include the Portland (OR) beloved Voodoo Doughnut. Respondents have posted maps of the chain’s locations with Portland’s plumbing locations, local schools, public transit, and airports to suggest ways that children are smuggled in and out of the stores. One member wrote, “Small submarines arent (sic) out of the realm of possibility.” The police say that they cannot do anything about the persecution, some of it generated by a former Breitbart News reporter.

Natasha Bertrand has tied together the threads of DDT’s targeted FBI and DOJ officials in his relentless attacks on people he depicts as dishonest “Democrats.” He depicts Ohr, Lisa Page, Peter Strzok, Andrew McCabe, and others who have had extensive experience in investigating money laundering and organized crime, especially connected to Russia. DDT’s big fear is that Robert Mueller’s team is expert in finding fraud, racketeering, money laundering, and other financial crimes. The article is well-worth a read, especially to see DDT’s connections to the crimes.

As Russia dogs DDT’s heels, he faces the week-long honoring of his nemesis, former Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). After his death at the age of 81, McCain got his final wishes—DDT did not attend his funeral and two former presidents, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, gave eulogies. DDT tried to minimize McCain’s death with the petty act of lowering the flag for only a day, but public backlash forced him to raise it again. He noticeably ignored his aides who wanted him to send out a statement about McCain being a hero while he continued his vendetta against the man who spent over five years in a Vietnam prison camp while he dodged the draft with four deferments and a bout of bone spurs. On the campaign trail, DDT called McCain a loser because he was imprisoned during the Vietnam War. “I like people that weren’t captured,” DDT said. He started his criticism of McCain in 1999 as this video shows.

Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders may be collateral damage from McCain’s death. DDT supposedly joked that she was “having a nervous breakdown” because of the way she looked at him when he refused to answer whether McCain would have been a better president than President Obama. “I don’t want to comment on it,” DDT said. “I have a very strong opinion.” He left town for a campaign rally in Indiana before McCain’s body arrived in Washington, D.C. for a memorial service and then went to his Virginia resort to play golf during McCain’s funeral in Washington, D.C. today.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) may be breaking up with DDT, McCain’s replacement after McCain’s illness became terminal, because Graham criticized DDT’s handling of his former friend’s death. Graham said:

“It bothers me greatly when the president says things about John McCain. It pisses me off to no end, and I let the president know it, And the way he handled the passing of John is just — it was disturbing.”

Graham did invite DDT’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka and Jared, to the funeral.

McCain’s death hasn’t slowed down Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia and DDT. Paul Manafort’s next trial, postponed for a week until September 24, follows rumors of a possible plea deal for the second set of charges before he was convicted last week, but the two sides couldn’t work out a deal. Mueller has also received more time to decide whether to retry Manafort on the ten charges from the last trial after one person created a hung jury on these charges.

W. Samuel Patten, a Washington consultant who advised a Ukrainian political party and worked with a co-defendant of Paul Manafort, pleaded guilty to failing to register as a foreign lobbyist while working on behalf of a Ukrainian political party. Patten’s partner, Konstantin Kilimnik, Patten’s partner and former Manafort employee, has been indicted for witness tampering in Manafort’s case and links to Russian intelligence. Patten also worked at the Oregon office of Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, to target voters in the 2014 general election. As part of his plea, Patten admitted that he steered an illegal foreign donation to DDT’s inauguration from a Ukrainian businessman.

DDT’s latest comment about Sessions, who he has tried to separate from his Senate allies with incessant complaints, is that he won’t fire him until after the general election, perhaps to avoid the appearance of obstruction of justice. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) said, “My sense is the fix is in,” but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) still isn’t convinced, maybe worrying about his ability to get another AG confirmed. Donors are also complaining about Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, saying, “They haven’t represented … us well.”

DDT’s shiniest new distraction from his problems comes from his promise of a new trade deal with Mexico to replace NAFTA. The kickoff was a bit awkward when technology failed him in his conference call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto by and at his signoff when he told the president that “a hug from you would be very nice.” DDT is rushing the deal because progressive president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, takes over December 1. The clock is ticking, but the two-nation agreement may not be able to replace a three-nation trade pact, and Congress must agree.

Canada has been more reluctant, especially after DDT disparaged Canada and threatened the country with 25 percent tariffs on cars and auto parts exported from the U.S. The U.S. may be the loser because Canada is the #1 destination for U.S. products shipped abroad and the trade with Canada supports over 8 million U.S. jobs, many of them in the new “red” states. Canada also is unique because the U.S. doesn’t have a trade deficit with Canada. If the initial deal doesn’t include Canada, the U.S. will have trouble including the country later.

Most of the suggested pieces of DDT’s deal come from either NAFTA or the Trans Pacific Pipeline, but the name is new so that DDT can claim it as his own. He’ll just have to hope that people don’t see the drastic increases in prices from the deal and his tariffs if he wants to use it for getting people to vote for Republicans.

August 11, 2018

Congress is scattered across the nation on vacation, and Dictator Donald Trump (DDT) is watching TV, playing golf, and having dinner with other wealthy people at his resort at Bedminster (NJ). Robert Mueller continues his investigation, and witnesses testify to damning information about Paul Manafort. For example, he offered the position of Army secretary to Federal Savings Bank CEO, Stephen Calk, in trying to get a personal loan from the bank. Long-time friend and colleague Rick Gates reported Manafort shifting money through his offshore accounts.

DDT has bragged about how much more money black people make in wages since he was inaugurated, but he didn’t celebrate Black Women’s Equal Pay Day on August 7, the day representing how long into 2018 a black woman must work to be paid the same wages white males were paid just last year. Black women workers get 66 cents for the dollar that white men make after controlling for education, years of experience, and geographic location.

If DDT had talked about wages for black women, he probably would have lied, just as he did when he bragged that the U.S. is overflowing with “prosperity” despite “exaggerated” claims of widespread poverty. After a U.N. report that 18 million people live in “extreme poverty” in the United States, made worse by DDT’s tax cuts for the wealthy, DDT ignored his own economic analysts in exchange for a report from the far-right Heritage Foundation. One DDT economic adviser recommended that DDT say nothing about poverty because the steady economic growth, “inherited” from President Obama, “will end prob[ably] in 1-2 years.”

People in Missouri understood the importance of fair wages when they struck down a “right-to-work” law earlier passed by the legislature. The 2-1 margin of success for workers came from both urban and rural counties.

Agreeing with Supreme Court justice nominee that the president is above the law and the constitution, AG Jeff Sessions plans to ignore a court ruling to preserve the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and completely repeal and rescind DACA on his own prerogative. Sessions called the repeal one of the “lawful directives of Congress”—although that legislative body has passed no law regarding DACA. The judge had said that the government has no justification to stop DACA.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) irritated both congressional GOP members and DDT during his visit to Russia. Once against Vladimir Putin’s takeover of Ukraine and Crimea, Paul is now a full-blown Russia supporter. During his recent trip, he took a letter to Putin, but opinions differ on its contents. Paul explained that the letter highlighted how the U.S. wants to work with Russia on “countering terrorism, enhancing legislative dialogue and resuming cultural exchanges.” White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said that DDT provided only “a letter of introduction” because Paul had requested it. Before Paul came home, he invited Russian lawmakers to visit the U.S. Capitol, but GOP congressional leaders squashed the idea. Spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said:

“Neither Congress nor the leader have invited any delegation from Russia to the Capitol. Senator Paul is the only one that I know who is discussing it.”

House Speaker Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) followed that up with “That’s not something we’ve discussed.” Both McConnell and Ryan earlier said that Putin would not be welcome at the Capitol if DDT invited him to Washington.

Russia and DDT are also upset about the State Department’s new sanctions on Russia after the Kremlin’s poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer and his daughter living in England. U.S. company are prevented from exporting items such as gas turbine engines, electronics, and integrated circuits without legitimate purposes, similar to President Obama’s ban on any exports to Russia that might have military purposes. DDT objected, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited a 1991 law that mandated the sanctions. Russia has 90 days to agree to stop all use of chemical weapons and permit inspections before Pompeo exerts further measures such as withdrawal of U.S. bank loans and support for international loans, landing rights for Russian airlines, and diplomatic relations. DDT already stalled for over a month regarding congressional deadlines for other sanctions.

Sanctions against Russia will decrease U.S. exports, adding to the stress caused by DDT’s tariffs. Grifter and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross claimed that “all this hysteria is a lot to do about nothing,” yet BMW told Ross that the tariffs could endanger 45,000 jobs in South Carolina. A ship with $20 million worth of soybeans has circled the waters off the coast of China since July 6 after it failed to beat the new tariff deadline by mere hours, placed in response to DDT’s tariffs. The ship’s $12,500 daily cost comes to over $450,000 by now, and the contents make up a small part of the $12.7 billion in soybeans sent from the U.S. to China last year. In Washington, 6,000 tons of copper are stuck at the port of Vancouver as the ship scheduled to pick it up left after China announced a 25-percent duty on the product. Estimates indicate almost one million jobs in the state could be at risk because of suppliers, port income, and wages.

The North Korea deal becomes more like fish that smells after three days. DDT never had any agreement with denuclearization, and Kim Jung-Un now insists that he will take no action until the U.S. ends the Korean War. Pompeo promises progress but won’t say what, and National Security Adviser John Bolton indicated no steps had been taken. The estimate of North Korean nuclear weapons is growing.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) was secretly taped at a fundraiser for Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) giving his plan for impeaching DOJ Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein immediately after the 2018 general election. Most Republicans said that they weren’t going to impeach Rosenstein, but Nunes tells this story to woo donors and voters. DDT may not like some of Nunes’ comments on the tapes such as “sometimes we cringe on the president’s tweets.” Nunes also called releasing stolen emails, like WikiLeaks did with DNC emails, “criminal.” Rodgers won the Washington election to pick the top two candidates by only one percent, warning a serious challenge in the general election.

DDT’s lawyers are running a TV campaign in opposition to Mueller’s investigation by smearing it, claiming that DDT will be forced to lie if he goes into court, and declaring questions that are off limits—such as why he fired James Comey (check with DDT’s interview with Lester Holt) and whether he obstructed justice (check DDT’s tweets). Rudy Giuliani’s craziness continues with his invented DOJ “60-day rule” preventing Mueller from DDT’s investigation in the two months preceding the election and announcing that Mueller must finish by September. DDT is not a candidate in November 2018, and the “60-day-rule” failed to apply to Hillary Clinton when Comey announced an investigation ten days before her election. “Fair and unbalanced” Sean Hannity, as he calls himself on “fair and unbalanced Fox,” turned his three-hour radio show over to DDT’s lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow on Friday.

Tomorrow represents the first anniversary of Unite the Right in Charlottesville (VA) with a march near the White House. This image represents what white supremacists are celebrating in front of the White House and what DDT refused to condemn.

Inflation rose 2.9 percent in the last year while wages gained only 2.7 percent. U.S. “real wage” fell to $10.76 an hour last month, 2 cents down from a year ago. To many of us, 2 cents is very little, but over a year, it amounts to $41.60—important to people who make under $23,000 a year. Gas prices increased 23 percent this year, and housing, health care and automobile insurance have all gone up. Now we wait for price increases from DDT’s tariffs.

Donald Trump Jr. manufactured this visual lie when he Photoshopped “50” over DDT’s actual 40 percent approval rating. In his desperation, he failed to cover up the 40 percent. By now, Jr. removed his “fake news” from Instagram, but the internet never forgets!

Catching up on the last two weeks of Dictator Donald Trump (DDT) roller-coaster events:

Will the United States go to war to support Israel? That question may be front and center now that DDT has withdrawn from the Iran agreement for that nation’s denuclearization. Israel fired on targets in Syria that were believed to be Iranian soon after DDT’s withdrawal. Claims that Iran fired 20 rockets at the Golan Heights the most extensive Israeli bombing on Syria since the countries signed a disengagement agreement after the October war of 1973. Israel has illegally occupied Golan Heights since the Six-Day War in 1967. DDT’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, are scheduled to arrive in Israel soon for the opening of the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem on May 14. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has assured Israel that the U.S. will stand at its side in a fight.

DDT’s officials are circulating a report from Securities Studies Group, an organization with ties to DDT’s national security adviser John Bolton, that provides strategy for a regime change in Iran is being circulated among DDT’s officials. The plan is to stir unrest and help the Iran public to drive a wedge between the people and the nation’s rulers. The plan sounds identical to Russia’s approach to control the 2018 presidential election.

Israel’s military escalation came after DDT decided to please some of his constituents—including Vladimir Putin and Israel—by withdrawing from the Iranian deal. Russia’s economy desperately needs the rubles from the increase in oil prices if Iranian resources aren’t available. At the same time, Russia is concerned about Israel’s attacks on Iran, but DDT may side with Israel, again separating him from Putin. Perhaps DDT figures that a world war would allow him to declare military law, like in Turkey, so that he can remain dictator forever. Bernard Avishai discusses Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s motivations and the dangers of his country in pushing a war in the Middle East.

DDT announced his withdrawal several days before the deadline at the same time the media jumped on the millions of dollars in “pay to play” paid to his personal lawyer Michael Cohen for access to DDT. Since payments made to DDT’s personal lawyer were first announced, the amount has vastly grown, for example AT&T’s $600,000 to Cohen for access to DDT instead of $200,000. CEO Randall Stephenson called Cohen’s hiring “a big mistake,” and top lobbyist for the company, Bob Quinn, has retired. Quinn was a leader in opposing net neutrality. AT&T also paid Cohen to get approval for its $85 billion merger with Time Warner. Drugmaker Novartis agreed that its $1.2 million contract with Cohen was “a mistake.” Reports as of now show that Cohen was paid $2.95 million through Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen set up to funnel hush money to Stormy Daniels and perhaps others. The involved companies learned about Essential Consultants because Cohen reached out to them.

In his work to guarantee never-ending war for the U.S., former VP Dick Cheney, who mythologized weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, went on Fox Business directing DDT to believe the falsehood that Iran has these weapons. He also encouraged the continuation of “enhanced interrogation techniques” (aka torture).

DDT is also hoping that people will ignore all the Russia and Cohen scandals because three U.S. prisoners have been released from North Korea. He also hopes that his talks with North Korea will result in his receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, even encouraging his rally crows to chant, “No-bel, No-bel. When the prisoners arrived at 3:00 am, he said, “I think you probably broke the all time in history television rating for three o’clock in the morning.” DDT also thanked North Korean president Kim Jong-Un “ who really was excellent to these three incredible people.” They had been imprisoned for at least a year, and one of them had been sentenced to ten years’ hard labor in one of the world’s most brutal prisons. DDT plans to meet with Kim Jong-Un in Singapore on June 12.

While people become excited about the release of prisoners in North Korea, they forget the four U.S. citizens still held in Iran for longer than the newly released NK ones. DDT’s withdrawal spells disaster for these people, one of them 81 years old. Another two U.S. men are still illegally imprisoned in Turkey.

Although DDT’s new lawyer Rudy Giuliani appeared on Sean Hannity only nine days ago, so much has happened that it could have been last year. Giuliani, DDT’s lawyer for one day, said that DDT had paid Cohen $35,000 a week to clean up hush money to Stormy Daniels about her affair with DDT as well as “things that might come up.” DDT first agreed that he paid off Daniels and then tried to deny that he did, going so far as to say that Giuliani “will get his fact straight.” Giuliani lacks the skill to stay quiet, a serious problem in court. (Transcript for the program.) Giuliani went on another talk show to say that he knew the payment didn’t look good immediately before the election but changed his story to say that the settlement was made solely “to protect the President’s family.” He also might be waiving attorney-client privilege by saying that he had conferred with DDT before he talked about DDT paying Cohen. About the payoff, Giuliani said:

“I don’t think the president realized he paid him back for that specific thing until we made him aware of the paperwork.”

Despite being released from his law firm and claiming “sole concentration” as DDT’s lawyer, Giuliani appeared in a Florida court today to represent a woman accused of purchasing car insurance ten minutes after her car crash. He isn’t licensed to practice law in Florida but said the woman was her personal assistant.

DDT’s staff tried to prep him in advance of any interview with Robert Mueller, but he could answer only two questions in four hours. The argument might be that an interview could cut into time for his important work in the Oval Office, but evidence indicates that he “works” less than two hours a day. DDT is still falsely accusing that the investigators are Democrats as he continues his rant against the investigation. DDT is back to saying that he wants an interview with Mueller, but most people no longer believe him.

Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) issued DOJ with a subpoena after he was refused extensive information about a longtime intelligence source for the CIA and FBI with the concern that the source could be jeopardized if Nunes discovers the person’s identity. Common knowledge indicates that Nunes wants the information to take to the White House. DOJ officials offered a classified briefing about his demand, but Nunes threatened a contempt charge against AG Jeff Sessions. He also has not bothered to read earlier classified information that he demanded. Nunes is under investigation for three potential campaign law violations.

Giuliani’s bombshell about DDT’s paying off Stormy Daniels intersected with DDT’s appearance for the day of prayer, causing CNBC to tweet, “Trump leads National Prayer Day event after saying he repaid lawyer for hush money to porn star.” DDT signed the “White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative” that permits religious organizations to use taxpayer money to discriminate on the basis of gender and sexual orientation, allow religious organizations to be “experts” for public policy, remove requirements that religious groups refer anyone objecting to their teachings to other programs, and use his new “faith-based office” to guarantee no blocking of “liberty of conscience” of believers. (Sounds like Sharia law for evangelicals.) The major groups wanting to deny services to LGBTQ people are Mormons and white evangelicals, 20 percent of the population. Among that 20 percent, 47 percent think that it’s wrong to refuse business based on religious convictions.

States such as Kansas and Oklahoma are already passing laws permitting adoption agencies to prevent same-gender couples from adopting children. A lesbian couple in Mississippi was denied an adoption by the state the day before they were scheduled to take their daughter home despite a court ruling that the Mississippi’s ban on same-gender adoptions was struck down by a federal judge in 2016. In another case, the state Supreme Court ruled that a lesbian couple could divorce; a dissenting justice, Jess Dickinson, is now head of the agency denying the couple their legally adopted child. Bryan Fischer, former spokesman for the American Family Association (AFA), announced on his show that only Christians have First Amendment rights and protections.

Anti-LGBTQ preacher Kevin Swanson will hold the Bible Family Conference in Washington, D.C. on August 10-11. He wants to execute all LGBTQ people and all Girls Scout leaders because they support LGBTQ and women’s rights. He also wants Boy Scouts, now called Scouts BSA because it recruits girls as well as boys, to have a “sodomy merit badge” because openly gay scouts can join the organization. The name of Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) has disappeared as keynote speaker.

The six worst states for LGBTQ support are Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, West Virginia, Louisiana, and North Carolina.

No matter how bad the Russia collusion and hacking have gotten, the Republicans have seemed rather blasé about this involvement, even supporting Russia over the people in the United States. Will these Republicans change their position if they lose their electric power? Russian hackers have been attacking the U.S. infrastructure, including electricity, water, and transportation as well as nuclear and manufacturing sectors, and the federal government is getting worried. Last summer, the news that Russia had gotten into over a dozen power plants in seven states didn’t get much attention in the first year of Dictator Donald Trump (DDT) in the Oval Office. Now Russians have moved into dozens of states with their attacks on the infrastructure. Eric Chien, a security technology director at the digital security firm Symantec, said:

“We now have evidence they’re sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or affect sabotage…. They have the ability to shut the power off.”

Today’s public alert from the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI warned that these hackers have been targeting U.S. infrastructure for the past two years. They started by staging malware and spear phishing at small commercial networks before obtaining remote access in energy sector networks which allowed them to collect information connected with Industrial Control Systems. At least three simultaneous Russian cyber hacking attacks are going into infrastructure controls, stealing documents and using a “troll farm” called the Internet Research Agency to spread misinformation on social media for chaos and discord, and focusing on disrupting the infrastructure of U.S. and European countries.

Last summer, Congress passed a law mandating that DDT place sanctions on Russia, but he ignored the law. A letter from 140 House Democrats asked DDT to impose these sanctions on Russia, an action that the Treasury Department took after the chemical attack on a Russian double agent in Britain followed by the death of a Russian exile. Even these sanctions are weak, because they are only on the entities and people indicted by Robert Mueller. The State Department also released a condemnation of Russia’s “campaign of coercion and violence” in the Russian annexation of Crimea four years ago this week, but no sanctions.

A serious problem for Republicans this week comes from the House Intelligence Committee GOP announcement that it closed down its investigation into the Russian scandal before finishing its job. The committee issued a brief summary with a 150-page report supposedly to follow, explaining the GOP position that intelligence agencies were wrong in its evidence of how Russia supported DDT in the presidential election. DDT saw the GOP whitewash as a vindication.

Committee Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA), forced from leadership of the committee after he briefed White House officials on committee information, has always protected DDT, even leaking information, and announced last June that they wouldn’t find any collusion. GOP members limited topics under discussion and witnesses’ questions while following White House restrictions and refusing to investigate phone and bank records corroborating witness claims. Nunes consistently undermined Robert Mueller’s investigation with false information. The person ostensibly in charge of the House Intelligence Committee investigation claimed ignorance of George Nadar, a key witness about secret meetings in the Seychelles.

The report was so biased that hard-right GOP Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), who led the Benghazi/private email server email against Hillary Clinton said that the GOP evidence was “motivated in whole or in part by a desire to harm [Clinton’s] candidacy or undermine her Presidency had she prevailed.” Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Monday that “there is evidence” showing the Russians attempted to help President Trump during the 2016 presidential election, contradicting a draft report from the panel. Rooney also warned that the government needs to act to prevent foreign interference in the upcoming midterm elections.

The GOP spin from other committee members, however, is that the intelligence community is wrong about Russian interference just as they were about Iraq weapons—ignoring the fact that the intelligence community denied “specific information” about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction before George W. Bush invaded Iraq. Then, as now with the GOP members of the “no Russian interference” group, the politicians were wrong in their perspective about the documents given them.

Deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah made an awkward statement by saying that DDT would have been aware of any such collusion if it did occur. In Shah’s words, proof of collusion would also be proof of DDT’s knowledge about it. Luckily for him, it appears to be an opinion.

Democrats on the committee had not seen the report when it was released and were not told about the conclusion before it was made public. Following the release of the GOP summary, the minority members of the House intelligence Committee released a 21-page “Status of the Russia Investigation.” The majority of the document is composed of four appendices, beginning in Appendix A with the outstanding lines of inquiry which have been partially or not at all addressed:

Hacking and dissemination of campaign emails by Russia to determine the specific of this cyber operation.

DDT’s campaign knowledge of the email hacks.

Elections security—or lack thereof.

Russian social media campaign.

Financial leverage in DDT’s business deals, perhaps for Russian money laundering and DDT’s actively negotiating a business deal in Moscow with a sanctioned Russian bank during the election, despite his assertion that he had no business dealings with Russia.

Money-laundering and foreign payments, already somewhat revealed by Robert Mueller’s special investigation which includes charges against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates.

Post-election effects and obstruction of justice, including intervention from and lies by Michael Flynn in U.S. affairs with Russia, DDT attempts to block James Comey to investigate Flynn, and DDT’s writing a memo to cover the June 2016 meeting in which his son Donald Trump Jr. and two other senior campaign advisers intended to get damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

Appendix B lists over 30 key witnesses which had not been interviewed with brief descriptions of their potential involvement which needs further inquiry. Appendix C gives over 20 entities, including Deutsche Bank, which should be sent “indispensable” documents that directly connect to Russian election interference. Fifteen other people and entities that should appear and/or present documents are in Appendix D. This list includes DDT, Jared Kushner, Hope Hicks, Erik Prince, and the White House. A key line in the most recent report from this committee:

The Minority has a good faith reason to believe that the White House does in fact possess such documentation memorializing President Trump’s conversations with Director Comey. Subsequent press reporting revealed the existence of a memorandum reportedly composed by President Trump and Stephen Miller that referenced President Trump’s communications with Director Comey.”

British Prime Minister Theresa May says that it is “highly likely” former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned in Salisbury, England by Russia. DDT refuses to mention the word “Russia” in connection with the poisoning although Secretary of State Secretary Rex Tillerson said that the attack “clearly came from Russia.”

Today, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster used strong language to decry Russia’s actions and blamed the Kremlin for “the abhorrent nerve agent attack” in England. It may be his last speech because rumors from the White House indicate he is to be fired by the end of the month, despite the press secretary’s denial. DDT has told Chief of Staff John Kelly that McMaster is too rigid and his briefings are too long.

Earlier, Nunes tried to protect DDT with a GOP committee memo about the Russian investigation that DDT erroneously used to proclaim exoneration for himself. It was followed by a heavily redacted response from the Democrats showing the GOP’s “distortions and misrepresentations.” Complaints that Christopher Steele’s dossier on DDT were responsible for a warrant to surveil DDT’s associate and suspected foreign agent Carter Page where shown to be totally bogus.

Meanwhile Robert Mueller is continuing his investigation, this week with subpoenas to the Trump Organization for documents, some related to Russia, in its first approach to DDT’s business affairs. Despite DDT’s denial that it has no holdings in Russia, witnesses have been asked about DDT’s business plans to build in Moscow. DDT has talked to Emmet Flood, the lawyer who represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment, about hiring him. Lawyers have advised DDT not to talk with Mueller, but he may be considering an interview if Mueller restricts the scope of questioning and concludes the DDT-involved part of the investigation within 60 days of the interview. Good luck!

Meanwhile Conor Lamb defeated Vladimir Putin in a U.S. House race last Tuesday in the far southwest Pennsylvania district with an almost 96 percent white population and so badly gerrymandered that no Democrat ran against the Republican in the past two elections. DDT won that district by 20 points in the presidential election. The former representative resigned after the publicity that the anti-abortion Republican encouraged his lover to have an abortion. This news was followed by multiple stories of his inappropriate action from his staff. Murphy is a developmental psychologist with a wife and adult daughter.

The media went crazy over the ballistic behavior of former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg after Robert Mueller subpoenaed his testimony and documents about major players in the Russia scandal. Nunberg first declared that he would refuse to comply with the subpoena, especially because Roger Stone is so special to him, before he made the round of news shows and backed down after continually asking if he could be put in jail with his refusal. Tuesday ended with a delicious segment on Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show. Nunberg showed up before the grand jury on Friday and testified. Grim-faced, he refused to comment afterward. While complaining on TV, he said that DDT knew about the June 2016 meeting between the Russian lawyer and his son and son-in-law a week before it occurred.

George Nadar, adviser to the United States Arab Emirates (UAE), also testified before a grand jury and is cooperating with Mueller. Nadar represented UAE’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan at a meeting in Seychelles meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor, a friend of Vladimir Putin. ant Erik Prince, DDT’s adviser who founded Blackwater and Betsy DeVos’ brother. Prince had wanted to set up a private military army for DDT in Afghanistan. Mueller is collecting evidence that the Seychelles meeting was to create a back-channel communication system between DDT and Vladimir Putin and foreign money for DDT’s campaign as well as Nadar’s meetings with Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon. Nadar’s testimony contradicted Erik Prince’s testimony before the House Intelligence Committee about his encounter with the Russian oligarch in the Seychelles.

After the story about George Nadar broke, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX) said, “I don’t have any clue who George Nader is.” Conaway is helping lead the House Intelligence Committee in the DDT-Russia scandal. In addition to his involvement with Russia, Nadar, DDT’s friend, was arrested for child pornography in 1985, including his having received a package with a film of young boys engaged in sexual acts and photos of nude boys. Reasons for the dismissal of the case are not clear.

Paul Manafort pled not guilty to all the charges against him in Virginia, but he is now wearing a second ankle tracking device, the other for Washington, because the two jurisdictions have different systems. The Virginia trial begins in July 10, followed by a September date in Washington.

DDT may have obstructed justice or tampered with witnesses by asking at least two of them—White House counsel Don McGahn and former chief of staff Reince Priebus—about their interviews with Mueller.

After head of the National Security Agency, Mike Rogers, testified that the president had not directed him to prevent Russia’s targeting U.S. elections, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tried to cover for DDT’s inaction, but thus far the State Department has spent $0 of the $120 million allocated to fight foreign cyberattacks on elections. Not one of the 23 analysts working in the Global Engagement Center speaks Russian, and the department has a hiring freeze. DDT is still delaying any sanctions ordered by law and denied that Russian meddling had anything to do with “our votes” in 2016. He promises a “very, very deep study” and “strong suggestions” before the 2018 midterms.

DDT keeps pushing the media to investigate the Russia collusion in the time of President Obama, and they have—with all roads ending at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) refusing to release any information about Russian election meddling before DDT was elected. McConnell says that he’s “perfectly comfortable” with that decision to conceal the Russian election manipulation from the public.

Nastya Rybka (real name Anastasiz Vashukevich), an escort in Thailand, claims to have 16 hours of audio proof connecting the Russian campaign to DDT that she will release if the U.S. gets her out of prison.

Title X, the only federal grant program dedicated to comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services, will now favor programs with a focus on abstinence-only sex education and “natural” family planning methods. The over 4 million people who use this program for health department and other nonprofit community health centers, in place for almost a half century, may have more difficulty obtaining birth control or getting access to cancer and STD screenings with the new guidelines. Title X funded clinics helped people prevent 822,300 unintended pregnancies, averting 387,200 unplanned births and 277,800 abortions in just 2015.

Jeff Sessions is suing California to overturn state immigrations laws, including the program that inspects federal immigration detention centers for its rampant mistreatment and abuse by private companies. DOJ is also threatening any other states that pursue similar laws. State and local officials have complained about DDT’s ICE activities because they undermine local economies and make communities more dangerous.

DDT has decided to remove new tee markers with the presidential seal from his golf courses. [Markers at Eagle Sign, New Albany (IN) and Louisville (KY)] Manufacture or use of the seal, its likeness, “or any facsimile thereof” for other than government business is punishable by up to six months in prison. Earlier, DDT used the “family crest” that he took without permission from the family owning Mar-a-Lago.

After DDT said he talked to North Korea on the phone when he actually spoke to South Korean Moon Jae-in, he announced a meeting with North Korea in late May without any State Department or other diplomatic input, probably to draw attention from Russia or Stormy Daniels. Hours before DDT announced the talks, State Department Secretary Rex Tillerson said that talks would not be “realistic” or prudent yet. DDT put Kim Jong-un in control by elevating a rogue state to an equal to the United States—without any rewards for the U.S. The day after DDT’s announcement, the press secretary said that conditions need to be met before the meeting. Look for far more media about the meeting that may never happen.

Jared Kushner also ignored diplomats, including the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, when he met with the Mexican president.

At the Gridiron Dinner, a gathering of 65 journalists with a self-deprecating roast-like speech by the current president, DDT made all his jokes at the expense of his family, colleagues, and enemies. Before the speech, he said, “My staff was concerned that I couldn’t do self-deprecating humor.” He can’t.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA accused Stephen Colbert of being a “danger” to the nation after a segment in which Colbert showed a memo stating “Devin Nunes is a [redacted]” with the question about what the redacted word is. After trying to shut down the probe into the DDT-Russian collusion, Nunes added that Colbert, like others on the left, “attack people who are trying to get to the truth.” Colbert answered Nunes complaint by showing another segment in which he was unable to meet with the representative.

Virginia Heffernan described Ivanka Trump’s growing problems with her connections with former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who lied to the FBI; developer Felix Sater, guilty of a $40-million stock fraud scheme with the Russian mobsters; and Tamir Sapir, tied to racketeering with the Gambino crime family before he died. Ivanka brought Flynn to DDT, toured Russia with Sater, and collaborated with Sapir. Heffernan also described Ivanka’s involvement in shady real-estate projects.

When DDT hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Netanyahu said, “This will be remembered.” As the Mueller investigation gets closer to possible Russian collusion with DDT, Israeli police has recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on bribery, fraud, and breach of trust in three corruption cases, the most recent one this week. Mueller is getting closer to DDT’s corruption. “This will be remembered.”

Fond of dictators in other countries, DDT wants to emulate China after President XI Jinping wants to do away with any term limits in the Constitution. DDT praised Xi’s efforts to become “president for life” and said, “Maybe we’ll have to give that a shot someday.”

Afraid of firing people, DDT lets others discharge them or belittles them in the hopes that they will quit. Now that DDT is ready to dispense with John Kelly as Chief of Staff, he has sent Anthony Scaramucci on the talk show circuit to smear Kelly. At least that’s what the media from left to right is reporting, although Scaramucci says the story from White House insiders isn’t true.

This last week, DDT tweeted that he was asking China for ways that they could reduce their trade deficit with the United States by $1 billion. DDT’s administration figure is actually $100 billion; he was off by $99 billion. And why would China want to do this?

[Note: Survivors of the Parkland (FL) school shooting cannot get a permit for their March for Our Lives on March 24 because a student group “at a local educational institution” wants to film a talent show on the Mall on that date. That permit states, “Games will be the main activity for filming,” and equipment listed “two tables, two bikes, and jump ropes.” March for Our Lives organizers planned their rally away from federal land and in D.C., on Pennsylvania Avenue between Third and 12th streets NW.]

The increasing fury from the tweets of Dictator Donald Trump (DDT), such as his primal scream “WITCH HUNT,” has been worsened by revelations about White House policy possibly being directed by Jared Kushner’s need for money. The debt on his Fifth Avenue property, $1.4 billion, comes due next year. Investigations show possible connections between financing for Kushner’s family business and Kushner’s discussions with Qatar, Turkey, Russia, China, and the United Arab Emirates:

The punishing blockade against Qatar occurred after a Qatar billionaire decided not to invest in Kushner’s business.

Apollo Global Management loaned Kushner $184 million, triple the average size of a typical loan, after an Apollo founder Joshua Harris, advising DDT about infrastructure, met with Kushner about a White House job for Harris.

Israel’s Menora Mivtachim loaned $30 million to Kushner for additional equity in 10 Maryland apartment complexes just before DDT’s trip with Jared and Ivanka last May. Since then, DDT declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel and the move of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

Kushner has now lost his high-level security clearance to a status below the White House chief calligrapher, which includes his losing access to DDT’s daily brief.

Robert Mueller’s investigation:

DDT’s attacks on AG Jeff Sessions for his handling of Sessions’ assignment of his inspector general to examine GOP accusations of FISA surveillance procedures as well as whether DDT tried to get rid of AG Jeff Sessions last summer to get control of the Russia investigation.

Whether DDT knew about Russia stealing DNC emails before the public was aware of the action and whether DDT knew when WikiLeaks was going to release the hacked emails. In July 2016, DDT asked Russia to find emails deleted by Hillary Clinton.

Whether DDT’s associate Roger Stone knew about the email information before it was public. Stone lied about not having direct communication with WikiLeaks during DDT’s campaign. Democrats asked the House Intelligence Committee to subpoena WikiLeaks messages with Stone, but Chair Devin Nunes (R-CA) and the other GOP members have refused.

Nunes did release the Democratic refutation of the GOP House Intelligence Committee memo and explanation of the warrant to surveil Carter Page. A government watchdog group filed a second ethics complaint against Nunes’ leaking private information from Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) to the Fox network about the Russian interference to the media. After some of Hope Hicks’ testimony was leaked, the two top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, including GOP Richard Burr (NC), told House Speaker Paul Ryan about “concerns” regarding the operations of the House committee and accusations of the GOP illegal leaking.

The scariest Russian information this week came from Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency. He reported to the Senate Armed Services Committee that he cannot try to stop the Kremlin meddling—and perhaps control—of U.S. elections without presidential authorization—which DDT won’t give. Members of the NSC understand that DDT would perceive any discussion of the Russian problem as a personal affront. Rogers, due to retire in April, said, “President Putin has clearly come to the conclusion that there’s little price to pay and that therefore ‘I can continue this activity.’”

Vladimir Putin continues to make fools of conservatives, who he calls “useful fools.” In his latest address, Putin announced Russia has an “invincible” missile moving at hypersonic speed with an “unlimited” range that renders defense “completely useless.” He said that “any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies to be a nuclear attack on our country.” DDT had no response to Putin and saved his energy for tweeting against Alex [sic] Baldwin after his performance on Saturday Night Live.

DDT has a serious problem with his animosity toward Iran. He has incessantly threatened to sever the U.S. deal with Iran to keep it from developing nuclear weapons in order to please his base. At the same time, Russia, who DDT doesn’t dare offend, is building a closeness with Iran, becoming that country’s most important ally.

DDT is scapegoating former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe by accusing him of leaking information in October 2016 about conflict within the FBI and DOJ regarding Hillary Clinton’s family foundation and then intentionally misleading investigators about what he had done. The DOJ is also investigating former FBI director James Comey, his statement about closing the cases against Clinton’s email server without charges, and his decision to announce resumption of his work in this area only ten days before the presidential election. Last May, DDT asked McCabe in a meeting who McCabe voted for in that election and attacked him in tweets about his wife taking donations from a Democrat’s PAC for her political campaign. McCabe’s retirement is scheduled for March 18.

In trouble for paying legal fees defending DDT and Donald Trump Jr. in the Russian collusion, the RNC switched the monthly $37,541.67 to rent part of Manhattan’s Trump Tower. DDT’s election campaign also paid over $470,000 in rent for space at Trump Tower during 2017. Other RNC expenditures include $427,000+ expenditures at DDT’s properties such as Trump International Hotel (Washington, D.C.), Mar-a-Lago (Palm Beach), and Trump National Doral (Miami). DDT’s former bodyguard Keith Schiller collected $75,000 for “security services” immediately after Chief of Staff John Kelly fired Schiller in September, and the RNC said that he is being paid to consult on its 2020 convention site selection. VP Mike Pence’s son, John Pence, also gets over $7,000 a month for “consulting,” and DDT political ally Brad Parscale, DDT’s former campaign digital director and newly-named 2020 campaign director, got over $882,000 from the RNC in January.

Parscale sold his digital company last year for $10 million to CloudCommerce that it has not made a profit for almost ten years and spent over $19 million in investor money since it was started almost 20 years ago. At this time, CloudCommerce has $107,000. In 2006, a top executive was caught in an FBI bribery sting and pled guilty to securities fraud. Andrew Van Noy, Cloudcommerce’s chief executive, has earned less than $9,000 in each of the past three years and has faced six-figure debts from unpaid credit cards and repossessed cars while facing two real-estate fraud lawsuits. Parscale, a member of the board, hired Eric Trump’s wife, Lara, for an undisclosed amount.

DDT hasn’t said anything about the stock market since its volatility in early February, but his announcement of tariffs—25 percent on steels and 10 percent on aluminum—caused the markets to plummet again this week. A president can legally impose tariffs with proof that imports threaten U.S. national security. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross doesn’t believe in the significant “trickle-down” possibility of price hikes with taxes on imports. All DDT’s advisers and the GOP legislators opposed the move except the Commerce Department. Just days before the announcement, DDT’s former adviser Carl Icahn sold $31.3 million of stock in Manitowoc, a manufacturer relying on steel. It is the first time that Icahn trade these stocks in two years. DDT’s answer to global concerns both foreign and domestic is that “trade wars are good and easy to win.”

Traumatized by the tariffs, the GOP is also suffering from DDT’s statement:

“I like taking the guns. Take the guns first, go through due process second.”

The only gun position DDT has consistently kept this week is to arm the teachers, despite objections from diverse groups. Evidence supporting the insanity of arming teachers come from increasing news such as the “Teacher of the Year” in Georgia who fired a gun in his classroom this week, the six-year-old who found his teacher’s gun that had been left on the back of a toilet and the third-grader who reached into an armed guard holster and fired his gun.

Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto won’t be coming to visit DDT— Peña Nieto’s second cancellation since DDT’s inauguration because DDT won’t admit that Mexico won’t be building the wall. Mexican officials said that DDT “lost his temper” during the 50-minute telephone call; U.S. officials called him frustrated and exasperated. DHS Director Kirstjen Nielsen has canceled her visit to Mexico. Jared Kushner was in charge of U.S.-Mexico relationships.

More to come about appointments, resignations, lawsuits, etc. during Week 58.

Remember when Congress passed the last stall to the spending bill on January 22, 2018? That was the one they passed because they couldn’t meet the December 21, 2017 deadline when they couldn’t meet the October 1, 2017 deadline. No problem! They claimed they could get a spending bill in three weeks. Everyone knew they couldn’t. The House passed an unconstitutional anti-abortion bill that lost in the Senate, and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) deliver the dud memo that DDT thought would save him from an investigation. It did garner Nunes’ opponent, Democrat Andrew Janz, $300,000 for his campaign in 72 hours. And Congressional members also wandered off to West Virginia for most of a working week while hitting a garbage truck on the way.

The next deadline is this Thursday, and nothing has been done to move forward on it. Republicans promised to deal with the immigration issue but only holds the DACA Dreamers hostage. The next spending bill delay piles the bill on top of a DACA immigration deadline on March 5 and the debt ceiling, a month closer to early March because the Treasury is giving handouts to the wealthy and big corporations.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is already taking extraordinary actions to pay the nation’s bills by suspending payments into federal employee retiree, health and disability funds. This time of the year is harder on the treasury because of income tax returns. Last year’s budget deficit was $666 billion, the largest since the recession recovery in 2013.

DDT claimed that he fired former FBI director James Comey because the agency was in “turmoil, but it was the firing that created chaos within the FBI. Both Comey’s and Andrew McCabe’s firings from DDT’s politicization have been responsible for the demoralized environment that has grown only worse from the smear memo from Nunes’ memo. about the surveillance warrant request for Carter Page. Even some Republicans are withdrawing from Nunes and his memo, rejecting the idea that the memo exonerates DDT.

If not outright “misrepresenting” facts, the memo omits information about the research and documents including the background going back at least three years before Page’s involvement with DDT. In August 2013, Page bragged about being an “informal advisor” to the Kremlin. In the memo, Nunes claimed that the FBI didn’t know anything about Page’s Russian connections until Christopher Steele’s dossier of summer 2016 that was paid for by Democrats after conservatives stopped paying for the investigation into DDT.

Discovering that people were not buying his take on the FISA warrant for Page, Nunes switched his focus to George Papadopoulos, asking why there was no warrant for him. Then Nunes left out information about Papadopoulos when he said he didn’t deserve a warrant, claiming that he only got drunk in London and criticized Hillary Clinton instead of the report that he told a diplomat about getting hacked emails with “dirt” on Clinton. He even claimed that DDT had never met Papadopoulos (center left), but a small meeting with the two of them in 2016 is documented in a photo from a campaign meeting.

In an effort to take attention away from his nothing-burger memo, Nunes told Sean Hannity that the real Russian collaborator is the Hillary Clinton that weaponized the FBI against DDT. Nunes claimed that the memo shows a “clear link” between Russia and the Clinton campaign, although the memo only mentions that the Clinton campaign paid for part of Steele’s dossier. Missing from the memo—and Nunes’ talking points—is that a conservative group initially commissioned the investigation on DDT because he was obviously the GOP presidential campaign.

Ellen Nakashima explained in the WaPo that another Nunes point in the memo was also wrong: the application for surveilling Page came from a political source, according to the request. Asked about this discrepancy on Fox & Friends, Nunes said the information was not good enough because it was in small print in a footnote:

“A footnote saying something may be political is a far cry from letting the American people know that the Democrats and the Hillary campaign paid for dirt that the FBI then used to get a warrant on an American citizen to spy on another campaign.”

Failing to successfully communicate his lie about the memo vindicating him, DDT grew more desperate last Monday morning with a smear tweet about the Democratic senator from California with fake stories about his leaking information, “Little Adam Schiff …. Must be stopped!” During his tweets last weekend, DDT clearly indicated he approved the memo in order to block the investigation into Russian meddling with the presidential election.

The popularity of #release the memo came from “bots,” computational propaganda capable of sending massive numbers of social media messages which led to bots claiming they weren’t bots. The “fake” news from bots is changing behavior as shown in this detailed explanation of how a bot “personalizes” with “fake” photos and disseminates fake information about progressive causes.

The House Intelligence Committee has unanimously voted to release the Democratic memo that refutes much of what Nunes wrote. Once again, the ball is in DDT’s court. He has five days to decide whether to release or block it—probably while spweeting (sputter-tweeting?) more about Schiff “leaking” information. The committee can vote to override DDT if he blocks the release, and it can be read into the House record.

DDT has called Nunes a “Great American Hero.” The committee chair said he is keeping secret his “Phase Two” of the GOP investigation to focus on the State Department’s role in the early states of Russian investigation. Almost a year ago, Nunes recused himself from any investigations related to Russia because of an ethics charge that he was giving information to the White House. Charges were dropped last December, but his behavior may call on more ethics charges. Republicans report that as many as five more memos may appear, sure to provide more cover for DDT and avoid the nasty problems of the spending bill and the debt ceiling.

While the media buzz was primarily about Nunes’ memo, DDT set another record: today’s Dow Jones fall of 1,179 was the biggest ever, not even close to the 777 points lost on September 29, 2008. On the same day, the S&P lost its entire January gain, and the Nasdaq was down for the seventh of the last nine days. The Dow loss is on top of over a 1,000+ drop last week; the value equals a loss of over $1 trillion in the first five days of February. Although some people blame the upcoming increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, others say the reason is the rising bond market as the U.S. Treasury is borrowing more money. It has to pay for all those tax cuts to the wealthy and big corporations.

Last year, investors ignored the possibilities of a trade war with China, a nuclear war with North Korea, and other fear that might have been discouraging to the stock market. The removal of regulations, especially for Wall Street, encouraged them to buy, buy, buy—driving the Dow Jones index up 10,000 points in the ninth year of its boom. Now the cheap money from global central banks may disappear with rising interest rates.

GOP said that the tax cut would cause big corporations to invest in businesses and hire more workers. Instead, corporations are sheltering more and more of their money or buying back ownership in their companies, an action that briefly drove up stocks. Rising wages and interest rates are a sign of inflation which the Fed will try to ward off by raising the interest rates again. Janet Yellen, who kept rates low, is no longer the Federal Reserve chair, and investors don’t know what the new chair, Jerome H. Powell, will do.

Energy corporations lack high earnings, resulting in the biggest drops in stock value, and health stocks were badly hurt by three large companies creating their own health care company for their employees. Tech stocks went down, and the new Apple I 8 and X phone suffered a downturn in sales. Oil prices went down. There’s not a crash, but the market may be “correcting,” a euphemism for going down.

Kellyanne Conway celebrated her one-year anniversary after inventing the term “alternative facts” by doubling down on the appropriateness of the GOP fictional perspective. In a radio interview, she decried the practice of fact-checking by saying that “Americans are their own fact-checkers” and they “have their own facts.” She added that “the stock market is something [Americans] know about because they’re part of the investor class,” forgetting that fewer than half of those “Americans” have any involvement in the stock market and pretending that the stock market equals the economy. (Maybe her next statement could be “ignorance is knowledge”?) All these people who Conway referenced will now know that the stock market dropped eight percent in as many days.

February 2, 2018

The Memo is out! For weeks, Fox’s Sean Hannity has been calling on Dictator Donald Trump (DDT) to release a document that would destroy the Robert Mueller investigation into the Russia’s collusion to win the presidential election for DDT. Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), who got his spin for the memo from the White House, pushed the release of misleading, inaccurate information to protect DDT with the vote of his GOP members of the Intelligence Committee, who also unanimously denied the Democrats to release any information. After the memo was approved, Nunes changed the memo because he gave it to DDT, and the White House could then make more changes, also not approved by the committee, before permitting its release.

Both DDT’s FBI director, Christopher Wray, and National Intelligence director, Dan Coats, warned DDT that the memo’s information was inaccurate and compromised classified information. DDT didn’t even read the document before he agreed to its release.

The memo accuses the FBI and DOJ of abusing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act when he it obtained a warrant to surveil an adviser for DDT’s campaign because the reason was misleading. The FBI and DOJ first applied for a warrant on October 21, 2016 to surveil Carter Page. A renewal was required every 90 days. Three signers of a warrant—James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Sally Yates—have been fired; two, Dana Boente and Rod Rosenstein, remain in the government. Rod Rosenstein may be fired because he might not be willing to fire Robert Mueller.

Nunes claimed that Christopher Steele, paid to prepare a dossier on DDT, told a senior DOJ official that he wanted to be sure that DDT didn’t get elected with no evidence of any bias against Page, the subject of the warrant. The memo also claims that no warrant would have been obtained without the Steele dossier, but there is no evidence about this except private testimony that others claim has been “mischaracterized.” The FBI had considered Page might be a target of Russian intelligence long before he became involved with DDT after Page met a Russian spy in 2013.

The document’s conclusion concentrates on the text messages between two FBI employees that, according to the memo, illustrated “a clear bias against Trump and in favor of [Hillary] Clinton, whom Strzok had also investigated.” Yet other Peter Strzok text messages are equally critical of Clinton, and he co-drafted the letter about publicizing the text messages related to Clinton 11 days before the election, an action that may have elected DDT. With no evidence, Nunes’ memo blames the employees for leaking information to the media.

The released document had only one surprise, that George Papadopoulos was responsible for initiating the FBI investigation after he bragged to an Australian diplomat over drinks in London that the Russians have dirt on Hillary Clinton before the hack on the DNC emails became public. Concerned about the Russian involvement, the diplomat warned the FBI. Papadopoulos is testifying to Robert Mueller.

In the past, Nunes demonstrated strong support for greater surveillance, voting for the expansion of the National Security Agency’s warrantless program and helping block others who wanted to restrict the agency from spying on U.S. citizens. He also rejected a suggestion to release the FBI/DOJ request for the warrant, redacted for classified information and privacy, to show what information was used in the court affidavit.

From his ranch in Arizona, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) issued a statement about Nunes’ release of the memo:

“In 2016, the Russian government engaged in an elaborate plot to interfere in an American election and undermine our democracy. Russia employed the same tactics it has used to influence elections around the world, from France and Germany to Ukraine, Montenegro and beyond. The latest attacks against the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests ― no party’s, no President’s, only Putin’s. The American people deserve to know all the facts surrounding Russia’s ongoing efforts to subvert our democracy, which is why Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation must proceed unimpeded. Our nation’s elected officials, including the president, must stop looking at this investigation through the lens of politics and manufacturing political sideshows. If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin’s job for him.”

Nunes apparently jobbed out the writing of his memo. His aides wrote the document, and he didn’t even see the warrant. Only one Democrat and one Republican, plus staff, are permitted to see these warrants. Nunes assigned the task to Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC). Therefore, Nunes cannot know whether his own document is accurate. The day after Nunes announced the release of the memo, Gowdy abruptly announced that he would not be running for re-election. Swept in with the 2010 Tea Party epidemic, Gowdy became famous with his incessant grilling of Hillary Clinton over four deaths at a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi (Libya) in 2012. One of the almost dozen “interviews” lasted about eleven hours and revealed no new information. By 2016, Gowdy admitted that Clinton was not responsible. Gowdy’s other persecution of Clinton was her private email server although he himself used private email instead of a government server. He said he wants to return to the justice system, and the 4th Circuit Court has a vacancy. may have his eye on an appointment for the 4th Circuit Court. Over 40 House GOP members of the 115th Congress are already not running in this year’s election.

Nunes has used his power to cover for DDT by refusing to investigate Russian interference. He is controlling the Republicans in the House: even House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) won’t disagree with his unethical actions and claims “malfeasance” in the FBI. Nunes also announced his release of the memo when DDT said that he would not follow a law by Congress requiring new sanctions on Russia when DDT’s CIA director, Mike Pompeo, has “every expectation that they will continue” trying to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections.

The GOP promised that Nunes’ memo would be “worse than Watergate.” Watchers of Sean Hannity and Fox will have an entirely different perspective of the memo than the rest of the world. And DDT will be delighted because he gets all his advice from Fox. He told friends that the release of the memo would allow him to argue FBI prejudice against him. Most people, however, as saying, “That’s it?” The memo.

Russia This Week:

DDT backed off on his guarantee because lawyers are afraid that he’ll lie to them. Seventy-one percent of people in the U.S. agree that he should agree to an interview with Mueller, and 82 percent of them want it under oath—93 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of Republicans.

Mark Corallo, DDT’s legal team spokesman who resigned last summer from concern that he might be exposed to obstruction, agreed to meet with Robert Mueller. His testimony involves Hope Hicks, communications director, who loves DDT “like a father,” who said in front of DDT with no lawyer present that the emails written by Donald Trump Jr. leading up to the Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer “will never get out.” Corallo notified the legal team about the conversation and took notes as well as sharing his concerns with Steve Bannon. DDT had insisted that the statement maintain that Jr.’s meeting was about Russian adoptions. Jr. insisted on the addition of the word “primarily” about the meeting subject.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein asked DDT for help before his testimony at the House Judiciary Committee to keep Rep. Devin Nunes from getting “sensitive documents.” In this December visit, DDT asked about the direction of the investigation and whether Rosenstein was “on my team,” similar to questions he posed to James Comey before he fired him and then Andrew McCabe who is also gone. DDT also proposed questions to the committee for Rod Rosenstein, including whether Rosenstein picked Mueller as investigator because Mueller wasn’t chosen for FBI director.

July 2017: Congress imposed new sanctions on Russia for election meddling with a deadline. Senate passed the bill by 98-2. DDT signed the bill with a note of protest and an angry tweet. He then missed all the deadlines.

January 29, 2018: Deadline for sanctions. Otherwise, DDT will flout Congress and violate the law. DDT announced he won’t be following the law. At the same time, CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats met with two top Russian spy chiefs. Reuters found out by reading Russian media.

March 24, 2017

When Dictator Donald Trump (DDT) signed S. 442 with $19.5 billion, the NASA Transition Authorization Act, I thought, “Finally! He did something positive!” Ha! Nope. With a $200 million increase (one percent), the bill is the first time the mission does not include earth science, including climate research, diverging from six GOP administrations and five Democratic ones. DDT’s budget from last week cuts out several NASA initiatives, including the Office of Education, and terminates the Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE), Orbital Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3), Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), and CLARREO Pathfinder missions. Through monitoring and predicting weather, climates, and ecosystems, these four satellites help save lives and prepare the nation for long-term changes.

The biggest failure for both DDT and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was Trumpcare’s failure, after Ryan postponed the bill on Thursday and completely pulled the bill today because it was short on votes. Ryan thought he could push it through in three weeks, passing it almost exactly one year after the Affordable Care Act passed Congress. DDT thought he could get the votes by threatening House Republicans with losing the 2018 election if they didn’t vote for it. He had already lied about convincing people to vote for the bill, and his threat picked up ten more “no” votes from representatives who wanted to completely destroy the Affordable Care Act.

Ryan decided that he could win over the scorched-earth naysayers by taking away ten Essential Health Benefits mandated for insurance coverage: outpatient care, ER visits, hospitalization, maternity and newborn care, mental health and addiction treatment, prescription drugs, rehabilitative services, lab services, preventive care, and pediatric services. Far beyond “health care light,” the bill ended up being “health care no.” That change lost less far-right voters, and it failed even after DDT sent white supremacist Steve Bannon and congenital liar Kellyanne Conway to Capitol Hill on a mission of gathering votes and passing along DDT’s threat that he would drop support for health reform if they didn’t vote on Friday.

Another huge failure for DDT came Monday when FBI Director James Comey announced that President Obama didn’t wiretap DDT’s phones in Trump Tower, as DDT claimed, but that intelligence is continuing its investigation into the possible collusion between his campaign and Russia. DDT’s source for his false contention that Britain helped the former president in wiretapping, frequent Fox guest Andrew Napolitano, has disappeared, at least temporarily, from the network, and DDT looked like a fool during his press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel when he talked about it. Fox eventually said that the network “cannot confirm Judge Napolitano’s commentary.”

In an attempt to spare DDT more embarrassment, the Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), past member of DDT’s transition team and chair of the committee investigating DDT and Russia, has called off hearings to block testimonies from former DNI director James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. Nunes also backed down from his assertion that U.S. intelligence was “monitoring” DDT and his aides.

On Wednesday, the third day of hearings for DDT’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, the normally split Supreme Court overturned one of Gorsuch’s decisions in which he ruled that schools were not required to provide education for disabled students.

And DDT had other failures.

DDT, who said he would pick the “very best people,” selected Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State. During his recent Asian trip, Tillerson told the only reporter on board that he didn’t want the job but took it because “my wife told me I’m supposed to do this.” Not everyone agrees. Tillerson has dodged the press, refused to answer question, failed to defend his department from a one-third budget cut, threatened to attack North Korea without further diplomacy, bailed on some responsibilities in Asia because of “fatigue,” and then planned to visit Russia instead of attending a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting in Brussels. About rejecting the press, Tillerson said, “I’m not a big media press access person. I personally don’t need it.” He also failed to hold a press conference for the release of the annual human rights report. It was the first time in the report’s 40-year history that this has happened. His inaction has also led to several vacant leadership positions in the State Department. And that was just the last week.

To Tillerson, diplomacy doesn’t work so the nation is vastly increasing its military budget. According to Tillerson’s version of diplomacy while ExxonMobil CEO, he kept quiet and let governments manage their own domestic politics. This narrow definition of “diplomacy” strikes bargains on the basis of private interests. Missing are interviews, press conferences, social media, and speeches to simultaneously address and shape public and legislative opinion simultaneously in multiple countries. Without credibility from Tillerson and DDT, past allies won’t be supporting the U.S. in its hawkish moves.

DDT’s honeymoon with Wall Street may be over, gone from starry eyes to bloodshot realism. Tuesday was the biggest Dow Jones drop of seven consecutive days of decreases. On the same day, the nine biggest Wall Street firms lost $81.6 billion in value, and the wider banking industry fell about 4 percent—again the worst single day for banks since the Brexit vote in June. Last week, the Dow dropped 1.5 percent, the largest since last September. An uncertain future for Ryan’s health care plan has made Wall Street wonder if tax reform will follow the same pattern. Without the giant tax cuts for the wealthy, vast sums of money won’t be funneled back to the rich (aka investors). Tax cuts are bad for the economy but good for the bloated financial markets. With today’s 60-point drop in the Dow, Goldman Sachs stock was the worst of the 21 losing blue chips, down 1.5 percent.

DDT’s interview with the conservative Time came out with this striking cover (right). Some of his unbalanced (insane?) comments:

Evidence for President Obama’s wiretapping conspiracy: “I have articles saying it happened.”

Credibility in him: “The country believes me. Hey. I went to Kentucky two nights ago, we had 25,000 people in a massive basketball arena. There wasn’t a seat, they had to send away people.”

Belief in conspiracy theory that linked Sen. Ted Cruz’s (R-TX) father Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald: “That was in a newspaper [that] had a picture of Ted Cruz, his father, and Lee Harvey Oswald, having breakfast.”

Insistence on forming a committee to find the three million “illegal” voters costing him the popular vote victory against Hillary Clinton: “If you take a look at the votes, when I say that, I mean mostly they register wrong, in other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, and/or illegally.”

A Gallup poll released Monday morning showed that DDT continues to break records across all age groups with his historic unpopularity. The Huffington Post reports that his job approval has fallen to an abysmal 37 percent, “lower than any other president at this point in his first term since Gallup started tracking the numbers 72 years ago in 1945.” Among millennials, DDT’s approval rating is 22 percent.

"WASHINGTON — Salvatore Giunta, caught in a nighttime ambush in eastern Afghanistan, stepped into a “wall of bullets” and chased down two Taliban fighters who were carrying a mortally wounded friend away.

Three years later, the Army staff sergeant on Tuesday became the first living service member since the Vietnam War to receive the nation’s top military award, the Medal of Honor.

Far from the perilous ridge where his unit was attacked, Giunta, now 25, stood in the glittering White House East Room, in the company of military brass, past Medal of Honor winners, his surviving comrades and families as President Obama hung the blue ribbon cradling the medal around Giunta’s neck.

“I really like this guy,” Obama said earlier in an off-script remark that drew applause. “When you meet Sal and you meet his family, you are just absolutely convinced that this is what America is all about.”

The Hiawatha, Iowa, man was an Army specialist on the night of Oct. 25, 2007. He and other soldiers of Company B, 2nd Battalion (Airborne), 503rd Infantry Regiment were part of a campaign to provide food, winter clothing and medical care to Afghans in remote villages.

They were ambushed from three sides in the Korengal Valley, a since-abandoned region of Kunar province after months of patrols that cost the U.S. military 42 American lives.

“The moon was full; the light it cast was enough to travel by without using their night-vision goggles,” Obama said, with Giunta standing at his side, looking straight ahead. “They hadn’t traveled a quarter-mile before the silence was shattered. It was an ambush so close that the cracks of the guns and the whizzes of the bullets were simultaneous.”

The two lead squad men went down. So did a third who was struck in the helmet. Giunta charged into the wall of bullets to pull him to safety, Obama said. Giunta was hit twice but was protected by his body armor.

The sergeant could see the other two wounded Americans, Obama recounted.

By now, the East Room was so silent you could hear a rustle from across the room. One Army officer took out a handkerchief and wiped his eyes.

Giunta looked down as the president described how he and his squad mates threw grenades, using them as cover to run toward the wounded soldiers. All this, they did under constant fire, Obama said. Finally, they reached one of the men. As other soldiers tended to him, Giunta sprinted ahead.

“He crested a hill alone with no cover but the dust kicked up by the storm of bullets still biting into the ground,” Obama said.

There, Giunta saw “a chilling sight”: the silhouettes of two insurgents carrying away the other wounded American — one of his best friends, Sgt. Joshua C. Brennan. Giunta leapt forward and fatally shot one insurgent while wounding the other. The soldier rushed to his friend, dragged him to cover, then tried to stop the bleeding, for 30 minutes, until help arrived.

Brennan died of his wounds. So did Spc. Hugo V. Mendoza, the platoon medic. Five others were wounded.

“It had been as intense and violent a firefight as any soldier will experience,” Obama said. “By the time it was finished, every member of First Platoon had shrapnel or a bullet hole in their gear.”

The ceremony, which followed the formal announcement of the honor in September, was attended by members of Giunta’s family and his unit, as well as top military officials, including Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Other Medal of Honor recipients also were present.

“You may believe that you don’t deserve this honor,” Obama told Giunta, “but it was your fellow soldiers who recommended you for it. In fact, your commander specifically said in his recommendation that you lived up to the standards of the most decorated American soldier of World War II, Audie Murphy, who famously repelled an overwhelming enemy attack by himself for one simple reason: ‘They were killing my friends.’ “

Speaking to reporters later, Giunta said the honor was “bittersweet.”

"Sometimes words aren’t enough. They get in the way, or don’t express what it is you’re feeling, what it is you want to get across. Eddie Garcia deals with those things. Armed with a guitar and a wide assortment of stomp boxes and electronics he releases thoughtful, internal, mood heavy music under the name 1970s Film Stock. Birds, his second album is out August 11 and we have the premiere for you right now.

There is a feeling of wanting to take flight across these seven songs, but it is flight that doesn’t ever really come. One is reminded of dreaming of bigger and better, locked in their room, wanting to leave it all but things like responsibility, physical means, or just good old-fashioned fear clip our wings and keeps us grounded to the confines of the same old life. The title song opens the album with this yearning, a wanting to be free. But it’s a song that never quite opens up and takes flight, much like our caged in protagonist. “In View” and “Slack” continue that feeling of looking ahead and dreaming but dreaming is all it is. The reality never lets it take root and develop fully. “Sling for Skeletons” lashes out at this reality. With its Carpenter like pulse underneath, it roils and simmers into an anger that wants to unleash and is dangerously close to doing so. “We’re Not Going Anywhere,” maybe resigned to the life it’s living, looks to express the beauty in the life it does have. “Walk Away” is the new day dawning. It’s now or never the guitar pleads with itself, but it can’t find it within to break free. “Victory Repeating” feels like a play on words. It does have the feeling of finally soaring but it repeats the same line over and over, like it’s trying to convince itself.

Of course, this is all highly subjective. This is the beauty of instrumental music. It is open for you to assign the meaning, to lay it over the framework of whatever structure your life has. To place it within your own context, to let it guide and soundtrack your late nights, early mornings, and in betweens. What do you hear through the notes? What feeling does it invoke deep down? There’s only one way to find out.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

What’s at stake in Fisher v. University of Texas?

The U.S. Supreme Court and affirmative action at Stanford

byAnnelise Heinzon Thursday, January 24, 2013 - 10:59am

“My own view is that color-blind admissions policies come several centuries too late and at least a generation too early,” law professor Deborah Rhode told a Stanford audience, making an ethics-based argument for affirmative action. In the current case Fisher v. University of Texas, the U.S. Supreme Court will soon make a decision that could end or dramatically remake race-based affirmative action admissions at universities, including Stanford. According to legal counsel Tom Fenner, the swing vote “is likely to be Stanford alum Anthony Kennedy.”

On Wednesday, a panel of Stanford scholars and legal experts gathered at the Black Community Center to discuss Fisher v. University of Texas and its profound ramifications. Depending on the court's ruling, universities like Stanford might be significantly restricted in their ability to take applicants' race into account in admissions decisions. Such a result, the panelists argued, would have serious consequences for social equity and diversity at Stanford. The panel consisted of legal scholar Deborah Rhode, historian Allyson Hobbs, and legal counsel Tom Fenner.

“My own view is that color-blind admissions policies come several centuries too late and at least a generation too early.”

Fisher v. University of Texas puts on trial a 2003 precedent that confirmed a limited role for racial considerations in admissions decisions. Although prohibiting universities from using racial quotas, the 2003 decision allows consideration of race as part of a holistic process that includes other factors such as student leadership and family background. Supporters of the University of Texas' current policies argue that removing race from the consideration of applications will not create a better meritocracy but will almost certainly result in a rise in white and Asian representation and a drop in the representation of other student groups, especially black and Latino students. Opponents of affirmative action counter that universities should be challenged to come up with race-blind ways to sustain a diverse student population.

The case and its key players

Plaintiff Abigail Fisher sued the University of Texas at Austin, or UT Austin, after she was denied admission in 2008. UT Austin follows a Texas legislature-mandated admissions policy of granting automatic acceptance to the top 10 percent of students who graduate from Texas high schools. Over three-quarters of current UT Austin students were admitted through this practice. In the top 12 percent of her class, Fisher was ineligible for automatic acceptance, and she was also denied admission in a supplementary process that took race into consideration, along with other factors such as student leadership and family background.

Fisher’s legal team has argued that UT Austin’s “Top Ten Percent Plan” has created a sufficiently diverse student body, negating any further need for considerations of race. UT Austin and other universities, including Stanford, disagree. If prohibited from considering race, Fenner explained, Stanford might adopt best practices implemented by other schools already barred from considering race by laws such as California's Proposition 209. However, he added, those schools have not been very successful at sustaining “the educational benefits from having a racially diverse student body.”

Excluded ethics

The panelists addressed issues of social justice and discrimination largely absent from the court case itself. In 1978, the Court rejected the idea that correcting historical injustices justified affirmative action, accepting only the argument that diversity provides educational benefits for all students. As a result of this decision, UT Austin has been left to justify its admissions policies by arguing that consideration of race is necessary to achieve a “critical mass” of students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds—and to achieve the educational benefits that flow from having a diverse student body. The inability of UT Austin to pin down a definition for critical mass, opponents say, is a weak link in the university's case.

In addition to educational benefits, Rhode and Hobbs emphasized the ethics behind racial considerations. “While preferential admissions criteria in universities are only a small part of the solution,” Rhode said, “they are an extremely necessary one if we are to overcome the history of racial segregation and subordination in this nation.” Rhode also cited research compiled in the amicus briefs filed on behalf of racial preferences, arguing that minority applicants admitted through affirmative action do at least as well as others, according to various measures of academic and career success. Hobbs agreed, saying that test scores alone are not an objective or fair measurement of a candidate’s merit.

According to Hobbs, ending affirmative action could effectively “screen out” individuals with diverse skills who would contribute to workplaces or schools. It would also reinforce a history of partial citizenship by limiting access to high-level work for which a college degree is required. “History matters,” Hobbs said, “and history casts a particularly long shadow over the University of Texas.” Affirmative action is necessary, Hobbs argued, in order for society to take responsibility for the effects of long-term exclusion. Hobbs emphasized the long history of discriminatory government policies and exclusion from or limited access to certain federal programs, at times achieved by Southern congressmen to ensure local control over federal dollars to reinforce Jim Crow. The GI Bill, for example, helped widen the racial gap as white veterans used federal money to pay for college, while discrimination in college admissions kept tens of thousands of black veterans out of school. After Brown v. Board of Education, the University of Texas banned black students from residences and sports. Hobbs also cited recent incidents that demonstrate ongoing racial bias and inequality at UT Austin.

Affirmative action at Stanford

The Court may issue a narrow decision applying only to UT Austin’s admissions policies. Or, it may pass a more sweeping judgment. Fenner, who appeared on the panel as an individual lawyer and was careful to emphasize that he was not speaking as a university representative, walked the audience through several possible outcomes for Stanford. Depending on whether the court upholds UT’s admissions process, invalidates all consideration of race, or falls somewhere in between, Stanford admissions staff could have “a busy summer” scrambling to change policy before the admissions cycle begins again in the fall of 2013.

A consistent supporter of affirmative action, Stanford filed an amicus brief in the case pointing out that “race neutral alternatives” such as admitting all applicants in the top ten percent at their high schools would not work for highly selective institutions, and have not yielded racial and ethnic diversity at other institutions. Stanford integrates race as one factor among many, attempting to generate the educational benefits of a student body that is diverse in multiple ways.

Rhode ended the panel discussion by supporting the ethical importance of affirmative action in the face of resistance. “People won’t like this,” just as they did not like desegregation, she argued, but the Civil Rights Movement showed “you can change patterns through legal requirements.”

--------------

“The Future of Affirmative Action: Fisher v. University of Texas” panel discussion featured law professor Deborah Rhode, assistant professor of history Allyson Hobbs, and Stanford Deputy General Counsel Tom Fenner. The event was hosted by the Faculty Women's Forum and was introduced by Patricia P. Jones, the Dr. Nancy Chang Professor in the department of biology. The Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity and the Clayman Institute sponsored the event. Co-sponsors included African & African American Studies, El Centro Chicano, Stanford Engineering Diversity Programs, Stanford Center on the Legal Profession, the School of Education, Black Community Services Center, Women's Community Center, Program in Feminist Studies, Stanford Diversity & Access Office, Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity, Vice Provost for Graduate Education, and the American Studies Program.

Allyson Hobbs is assistant professor of American history at Stanford. Hobbs, who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University and received a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, researches American social and cultural history, racial mixture, identity formation, migration and urbanization, and the intersections of race, class and gender. She was a 2011-2012 Clayman Institute Faculty Research Fellow.

Tom Fenner joined Stanford’s Office of the General Counsel in 1985, and became Deputy General Counsel in 2001. In his practice, Fenner focuses on the academic areas of the university, including faculty, student, research, and policy matters. He earned his B.A. and J.D from Stanford University. Fenner appeared on the panel as an individual, not as a university representative.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Why I won’t give a sample of my DNA to Decode Genetics

Last week I posted a picture on our Facebook page of the contents of an envelope I received from the company Decode Genetics, in which they kindly request that I give them a sample of my DNA. I made some glib remark about swabbing the dog, but didn’t really explain the full story.

Basically it is like this: Decode wants 100,000 Icelanders to give them DNA samples to put into their database. Apparently because the Icelandic population is so homogenous, our DNA contains clues as to what causes specific diseases. Decode wants to study this [indeed, Decode’s entire existence is built around studying this] and make tons of money selling their findings to pharmaceutical and other medical sector companies. BUT for Decode to be able to do so they also have to have access to our medical records.

In return for our contribution, Decode is offering to give us a t-shirt.

Let us just take a moment to contemplate this stellar offer.

/ a moment.

Now, maybe giving up my DNA and a large chunk of my privacy is all very altruistic and everything. Maybe it will help find cures for diseases and save lives. Maybe. But unfortunately there are things in this whole DNA collection shenanigans that I simply cannot accept. Here is why I have decided NOT to give Decode Genetics a sample of my DNA and access to my medical records [as if the last part wasn’t reason enough].

Decode’s little collection of samples began a day or two before their envelope arrived in my mailbox. It was kind of sprung on everyone, by which I mean hardly introduced at all before the packages were sent out. Along with the package and the forms we have to sign [and all the propaganda about how important this all is for medical research], we are told that someone will come by our house “soon” to pick up the sample.

That “someone” is in fact someone from ICE-SAR, the Icelandic Search and Rescue organization. That’s correct. Decode is using ICE-SAR, one of the most respected and best-loved institutions in Iceland, as couriers. This because Decode promises that if 100,000 Icelanders give samples, it will donate ISK 200 million to ICE-SAR. The search and rescue team can really use the funds. We know this. We also love ICE-SAR for the amazing work they do and want them to continue doing it without having to beg for donations. Which is why Decode’s manipulation is all the more effective.

So people who might be having doubts about giving away their DNA and access to medical records are effectively being told that, if they don’t take part, they are doing ICE-SAR – and by extension everyone else who might ever need rescuing – a really bad turn. Which makes them kinda bad people. Picture it: an ICE-SAR member arrives at Jón or Gunna’s home to pick up Decode’s sample, and Jón or Gunna promptly reach for the swab and guiltily provide the sample because the ICE-SAR guy is standing there waiting and who wants to deprive ICE-SAR of their ISK 2,000?

One comment I saw on Facebook was from a woman who had received her package one day, and the following day at 7 pm the ICE-SAR member was on her doorstep to collect the sample. Which brings me to another thing: the urgency with which this whole thing is being conducted. Bam bam – you get the package, then the next day someone is there asking for the sample. No time for contemplation or making an informed decision. It all has to happen NOW. And maybe that’s the whole point. Maybe it’s being done with this urgency precisely because Decode doesn’t want people to have to think about it too much.

Now let us digress for a moment, and take a wee look at Decode. It burst onto the scene in the 1990s, all through the efforts of one man, Kári Stefánsson, a MD who had the brilliant idea of turning the Icelandic nation into one big genome database. Everyone thought this was a fabulous idea, and Kári quickly got the backing of the Icelandic government. Before you could say sellmygenestothehighestbidder Decode had access to all Icelanders’ medical records. Yes they did. It was by default. Anyone who objected had to opt out. The onus was on them to do so.

I opted out.

At this time there was a massive amount of hype around Decode, and the public was urged to buy shares in the company because they were going to be huge. HUGE. Banks were practically throwing loans at people so they could buy shares in Decode. And lots of people did. Lots of people also invested all their savings in Decode shares. Then came the dot-com bust and those shares fell like a lead balloon. Kári’s salary remained one of the highest in Iceland, while those who had bought stock in his company were left practically destitute.

In the years since then, there have been bits of news every now and again about some imminent Big Breakthrough at Decode. Wery wery impressive and all that. Then, a few months ago, current affairs programme Kastljós did an interview with Kári where they asked him what all those imminent breakthroughs had actually produced. Kári stuttered, and couldn’t answer the question. Because, as it turns out, there has been hardly anything.

A few years ago Decode declared bankruptcy. Enter the US genome company Amgen, which swept in and scooped up Decode, putting still more money into Kári Stefánsson’s pocket. Only, the sale of Decode to Amgen was a tad controversial. One of the things that characterized it, according to this report, was “… the aggressive sale timeline that appeared designed to ‘inhibit potential bidders from gathering enough information to become comfortable with submitting a competing bid.’” Hm. Sounds an awful lot like the DNA collection happening right now, which inhibits potential participants from gathering enough information about the collection to make an informed decision about whether or not to take part.

Which brings us to a question: is this DNA collection, which is conducted in such a big hurry, really about medical research? Or might it have something to do with shareholders and stock prices? Because I am guessing that the DNA of 100,000 Icelanders is a fairly valuable commodity, and quite a coup if Decode Amgen manages to get its hands on it. I have no doubt that it will produce a sharp increase in share prices, if nothing else.

One last thing. When Decode swept onto the Icelandic market in the 1990s, one of its chief executives was one Hannes Smárason. He later left the company, only to become infamous in Iceland [and beyond] as one of the chief villains in the Icelandic economic collapse. No one around here trusts him. No one except Kári Stefánsson, that is. Hannes Smárason has recently been appointed CEO of a Decode subsidiary called NextGen, the role of which is to “market diagnoses based on Decode research to doctors and hospitals in the USA”. [Source here]

Yup. That’s the dude who is going to be trading in our DNA and medical records. Except I heard that he couldn’t start work just yet because he has been formally indicted by the Special Prosecutor for a economic crimes leading up to the meltdown.

Predictably there has been a major furore over all this here in Iceland. A group of academics and experts, including the head of the Centre for Ethics at the University of Iceland, have harshly criticized the collection and the way it is being executed. For me personally, the ICE-SAR involvement is the most distasteful element of the whole thing. I resent being manipulated like that, and resent that a wonderful organization like ICE-SAR is being abused in such a manner. Like many others I plan to bin the package from Kári and personally donate ISK 2,000 to ICE-SAR, in lieu of the funds that Kári, Hannes and co. would have donated on my behalf.

UPDATE: I’ve made two small amendments to the original post. I initially wrote that Decode would donate ISK 20 million to ICE-SAR, but the correct figure is 200 million. I had also written that Kári Stefánsson had taken millions out of the company and shuffled into his own personal bank account[s], but this is hearsay and not backed up by any concrete evidence. I have therefore removed it.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"2 September 2011

I have been a little obsessed with watching Korean dramas lately and therefore have been craving Korean food every time I see it on screen! 'You know you are a glutton when..' lol :P

One Korean snack I found particularly interesting was the Ddukkbokkie which is rice cake in a hot and spicy sauce. It is typically eaten as a snack but if you add more fillers such as vegetables, fish puffs, tofu skin, etc, it can also become a meal... which is what I have done.

Trixie and I followed the recipe from Maangchi but modified it a bit to fit what I had in my fridge. I wanted to use traditional Korean rice cakes which are shaped in long tubes, but since I had the sliced ones in my freezer already, I reluctantly substituted them for the tubes. So yeah... that's why it doesn't look very authentic :P

I first took out some frozen fish puff and oyster mushrooms.

Then, I soaked the fish puff along with the frozen rice cake and fish cake in water to thaw it out a bit.

My version of Ddukbokkie did not have the vibrant red colour you normally see in authentic Ddukbokkie because I didn't use the Korean red pepper paste. Instead, I used the Chinese hot chili paste (as shown in the picture). I also used Hon-Dashi to make the broth because I didn't have any dried anchovies, which is what you are suppose to use. If you are wondering what is inside the Ziploc container, it's just ketchup. But uh..don't ask me why it was in there :P

Yum... almost done!

I garnished it with a little bit of green onion and Ta-Da! Ddukbokkie makes great comfort food and it always warms you up inside. :) Because this version wasn't as authentic as I'd like it to be, I won't post up the instructions for how I did mine. You can follow Maangchi's recipe! When I get better at making Ddukbokkie, I will post up a better recipe for ya'll!",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Reading the New York Times Travel section this weekend, I stumbled across a site I hadn’t visited. Now that I have, it is sure to become a giant time-sucker in my life. It’s called DesignTripper.com, and it’s full of carefully curated, unique vacation roosts (houses, inns, B&Bs, even yurts) and restaurants that aren’t likely to earn you any Starwood rewards points.

This led me to their post about Fair Folks and a Goat, an amazing shotgun house in New Orleans that has a boutique, a coffee parlor, a gallery and one bedroom for guests with a rotating art installation inside (the one above is by local artist t Hannah Chalew), among other things. This spot can’t be summed up in a category or two; what’s so great is the way they support local artists and craftspeople. I also loved seeing local artwork (Time Out chair – so genius – is by Sarah Ashley Longshore), combined with two of my favorite items we carry, the Blu Dot Real Good Chair and Patrick Townsend’s Orbit Light, combined with classic New Orleans shotgun architecture:

Did any of you feel a wave of nostalgia for a Howard Johnson’s road trip stop while watching Mad Men last night? I kept thinking of my family driving from Ohio to Cape Cod in the family truckster (a tan Ford station wagon with wood paneling and flip up seats in the way-back) and stopping for a hot dog and an ice cream cone. The bright colors, light fixtures and even the waitress uniforms actually looked retro-fresh in last night’s episode.

Somehow, the combination of pot pies and orange sherbet leads to a devastating fight between Don and Megan, and he abandons her in a HoJo’s parking lot. How could he not, with that fabulous honeysuckle dress with matching chevron coat? It was made for a HoJo’s. Girlfriend even had on matching pink sunglasses. Tory Burch has got nothing on Megan’s costume designer.

Only that devilish cad Don Draper could make the iconic Howard Johnson’s roof look sexy.

Anyway, the wave of nostalgia made me want to look into the history of Howard Johnson’s. Because I’m lazy, most of this information was compiled via Wikipedia, so take it for what it’s worth.

Howard Deering Johnson opened drugstore in 1925, but soon realized that the soda fountain was the most profitable part. He started tinkering with ice cream and the business changed direction toward becoming a restaurant that became known for fried clams.

In 1932 a second restaurant was opened, one of the first franchise deals in the U.S. The first motor lodge was opened in Savannah Georgia in 1954, and it was designed by architects Rufus Nims and Karl Koch. From there, in a nutshell, the business boomed and the motor lodges became known for their ubiquitous roadside advertisements:

In the 1960s and ’70s, there were over 1,000 HoJos across the United States and Canada.

There is a site completely dedicated to posting pictures of former HoJos, called HoJoLand.com

Then, new owners and more new owners and big changes, bland architecture and a new logo that’s no fun. The End.

Oh, P.S. Also, when you Google “Howard Johnson,” this guy is interspersed between all of the motel pictures. He’s a singer:

There are so many great places to stay when traveling, whether they be easy on the wallet, easy on the eyes or easy on our backs as we enjoy a relaxing massage. I’m going to make more of an effort to share lodging that’s full of great design with you as it crosses my path. In honor of Liz Lemon, we’re going to christen this column “I Want to Go to There.” Sadly, this amazing hotel did not cross my literal path, but rather entered my life via an email from Jetsetter.com, which is always full of tempting trips I wish I could take.

Forget the bat cave, this hotel was formerly a house of bedrooms, carved out of a cave in Cappadocia, Turkey.

Common areas even have wi-fi, though unless you are booking a local hot air balloon ride online, being on your laptop at a place as beautiful as this should be a crime.

Turkish interior designer superstar Halide Didem designed the beautiful and exotic rooms. She layered bright colors, luxe fabrics, metallic finishes and exotic shapes atop neutral and natural base of textures, a design lesson we can all take a note from.

Beautiful terraces give guests a chance to soak in the views from a luxurious perch.

Cave bedrooms are a combination of rough-hewn walls that form a cozy room with sumptuous linens; the perfect combination for a great night’s sleep.

Are there any areas or hotels on your dream trip list? Please let us know about them in the comments section!

Let’s face it, we’ve all seen so many cleverly decorated boutique hotels that it takes a lot to catch attention lately, doesn’t it? I mean, we’ve seen everything from Beetlejuice looking B&Bs to crack den chic (a certain Manhattan too-cool-for-school joint, I’m talking to you). However, as I caught up on my magazines with an old issue of W the other day, a tiny picture from “August’s Most Wanted” caught my eye (yes, I am that far behind on my glossies). It was a shot of a bedroom from the c/o Maidstone East Hampton. Let’s enjoy some fresh eye candy from their Swedish icon designed rooms (inspirations range from Eero Saarinen to Birgit Nillson the soprano, not to be confused with Brigitte Nielsen, known for Red Sonya and Flavor Flav reality shows):

This week a group of images in our Fresh New Spaces Group on Flickr caught my attention. They were the minimalist spaces from a boutique hotel in Berlin called Hotel OTTO. Here, the neutral color palette and restrained furnishings let you enjoy the view, the photography and the warm hardwood floors:

This simple bedroom contains lots of space saving tips, including using thin but colorful upholstered canvases in lieu of a clunky headboard, and utilizing swing arm sconces to save nightstand space (and of course, when you don’t have room to cram in a nightstand, these are a great solution as well).

The palette is kept very simple, letting this iconic Eames fabric get the attention it deserves:

However, if a subtle blue, gray and black palette is not for you, they’ve got some electric preppy pink and green options for you. Note the extra shelf on the nightstand, which is great for tucking away books, magazines, and even that annoying glow from a digital clock that can exacerbate an insomniac. They’ve also scooped up some of the floor space with this piece so that you can take some of that stuff out of your suitcase and really get comfortable:",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The Henslowe-Alleyn Papers, Past, Present and Future

For over two hundred and fifty years, most of the Henslowe-Alleyn papers remained
unbound and stored in the chest in which they had lain since the founding of the
College by Edward Alleyn in 1619. Many individual documents, both large and
small, were left in their original condition: folded up into small packets (a
form of storage which preceded the use of envelopes). The volume comprising
Henslowe’s Diary began to be borrowed from the library during the 18th and 19th
centuries by the scholars Edmond Malone, John Payne Collier, and J. O.
Halliwell-Phillips, among others. In fact, during this time, some of its pages
were removed or otherwise destroyed (fragments have since been sold or auctioned
and are now at the British Library, Bodleian Library, Belvoir Castle, and the Folger Shakespeare
Library). In the early 19th century, staff at Dulwich were successful in
reclaiming the play The Telltale and the plot of the
Second Part of the Seven Deadly Sins from an auction, but over the
years many other items were dispersed (and have not yet been definitively
identified), including about one hundred play manuscripts and a number of
printed books bequeathed to the College in 1687 by the actor and bibliophile
William Cartwright the younger.

In the 1870s, the Governors of Dulwich College asked George Warner, an expert at
the British Museum, to catalogue the manuscripts. Warner spent many years
assessing the contents of the archive as he found it, expertly opening,
repairing and ordering the documents in the archive, finally having them bound
into a set of 36 volumes which he named the ‘Alleyn Papers’. He left the
muniments, some of which are extremely large in size, unbound. In 1881, he
published The Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Muniments of Alleyn’s
College of God’s Gift at Dulwich (London: Longmans, Green, and Co.).
Further discoveries at the archive were listed by Francis Bickley in the Second
Series of The Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Muniments of Alleyn’s
College of God’s Gift at Dulwich (London: privately printed, 1903).

Half of these manuscript volumes and most of the muniments concern the private
affairs and non-theatrical businesses of the Henslowe and Alleyn families, as
well as the history of Dulwich College since its inception. It is the other half
of these volumes, representing the theatrical affairs of Henslowe and Alleyn,
that are the subject of this website and electronic archive.

Less than half of the theatrical items in the Henslowe-Alleyn Papers have ever
been transcribed, and these transcriptions are largely available only in
out-of-print editions. R. A. Foakes’s 1977 photographic facsimile edition of two
volumes of manuscripts (The Henslowe Papers) had a limited
printing and only covers 20% of the relevant archive. The 2002 reprinting of
Foakes’s standard 1961 edition of Henslowe's Diary (Cambridge
University Press) has widely encouraged scholars to pursue other material in the
Dulwich archive. The archive is of value also to Museum of London
archaeologists, who are now using new technology, such as radar scanning, to
examine the original sites in Southwark and Shoreditch of various early modern
playhouses, including the Theatre, the Globe, and the Rose, and who are radically
re-evaluating their data about the building of these playhouses. Although
transcriptions of the over 2200 pages of manuscripts are not yet available in
this electronic archive and website, the members of the Henslowe-Alleyn
Digitisation Project hope that making the manuscripts themselves available as
photographic images will encourage further study and use of this very rich
resource not just by literary, theatrical and manuscripts scholars, economic, social and regional historians
and archaeologists but students, actors, directors and other theatre
personnel, as well as all members of the general population of readers who are interested
in the greatest age of English professional drama and theatrical production.

images and content are not downloadable from the website or the electronic
archive, nor can any material be used, copied, circulated or reproduced in any

"Tea Makes Everything Better

Does a hot cup of tea REALLY make everything better? There are many cute signs which promise there’s a tea for everything. Being an avid tea drinker, I understand the meaning behind the memes.

The simple process of preparing tea is contemplative. You can’t rush tea. It has its own time schedule. Waiting for the boil of the water and steeping of the leaves, allows me to slow down and prepare my heart.

Drinking a hot cup of tea calms my nerves, soothes my spirit, and relaxes my mind. When I’m stressed it untangles me. During times of hurt, it coats my inner pain. When my mind is so crowded I’ve left no spiritual whitespace, it erases the margins and opens up the mental page I’m thinking on.

I’ve given thought to why tea makes everything better for me. I believe It positions me to slow down so I can hear God better and be stirred by His Holy Spirit.

Why not take time today to indulge in a hot cuppa and spend time with The One who can make everything better?

4 thoughts on “Tea Makes Everything Better”

Just now, the realization hit me. June Chapko’s multiple talents have been influential in my life for over 30 years. My latest cuppa of inspiration comes from her book the Estate Sale. Once I begin reading it, I was unable to put it down until I finished it. And now, I am anxiously awaiting Book 2 of this Legacy Series.

I am doing some work for June, and I stumbled across her reference to an age-old British adage, “tea solves everything”. Cheryl and I know an Anglican-Catholic priest from England who told us a cup of tea is a great source of comfort.no matter the situation. “Oh, your home burned down? Have a cup of tea.” “oh, no! You were in an accident? Have a cup of tea.” He went on in this vein for many more minutes to further illustrate his point. And Cheryl has known for years the health advantages of drinking tea. So I was joyfully surprised to, * serendipity *, find both aspects of tea to be borne out to be absolutely true after researching June’s phrase, “tea solves everything”. It turns out reading June’s books are beneficial not only to your spiritual health but to your physical health as well. So live longer, healthier, leaner, and more stress-free while reducing your risk of heart problems and of certain types of cancer by drinking tea and by reading June’s books! https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/real-life-stories/a-cup-of-tea-solves-everything-505302

Thank you, Hal for such a great recommendation for my book. I do have to say…reading my book will not reduce your risk of any health problems, but it will increase your risk of wanting to read book two, Legacy’s Path, coming very soon.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The sizing options displayed for each framed print is for the size of the actual print. The frame and white matting will add additional width and height to make up the completed frame size. If ordered without mat then the completed frame size will be about 1.5"" wider and taller. The completed frame sizes are below and may vary a bit from frame to frame so complete frame sizing is also noted on each of the item descriptions.

When ordering a two print set that is unframed be sure to order each side of the print set. So if ordering the Be Still, My Soul set, you would add the Be Still side with the desired size to your cart and then add the My Soul side with the desired size to your cart to complete the set.

When ordering the framed set there is no need to add both sides. It is already set up to be added to your cart as the double printed set.

Most domestic orders are shipped with USPS and should arrive within 3-7 business days. Prints without framing may take 7-10 business days to arrive. Framed prints are made to order and should arrive within 8-15 business days.

Walleye Warrior: Alden Hirschfeld

All throughout our lives we must face adversity. It comes in many forms: moving to a new school, dealing with a bully, managing college courses, or battling though illness to name a few. Every person that you meet, or even see, in our world have their own demons to face every day. We all fight to achieve our goals while overcoming the challenges put in our way. Professional athletes are no different in this regard, where they differ is the attention that their adversity receives. When they rise to the occasion, athletes can inspire others to do the same. One particular member of the Toledo Walleye has battled adversity like no other, and has inspired hockey fans across Michigan and Ohio. Alden Hirschfeld took the ice this season after recovering from brain surgery over six months ago. During Toledo’s first game of the regular season, he scored the Walleye’s first goal. Hirschfeld is not just a Toledo Walleye; he is a Warrior.

Hirschfeld posing with a young fan at the Huntington Center during training camp.

Early in his career Hirschfeld found great success with relatively little resistance. Alden was born in Dallas, Texas to Glen and Traci Hirschfeld but grew up in Sylvania, Ohio where he played hockey for Sylvania Northview High School. Hirschfeld captained Northview to the state title game during his senior season (2005-06), scoring 64 goals that year which earned him the Mr. Hockey Ohio award. The award is given to the top high school hockey player in Ohio. After high school Alden played junior hockey with the Mahoning Valley Phantoms, a member of the North American Hockey League (NAHL) located in Ohio, for two seasons between 2006-2008. During his junior years Hirschfeld scored 86 points with 35 goals over the course of 104 games, once again showing off his offensive prowess. This would be a recurring theme for Hirsch during his amateur career. Following Junior hockey, the next stop was college play at Miami (OH) University. While a Miami Redhawk Hirschfeld played in four seasons, appearing in the national championship game as a freshman (08-09), helping Miami win the 2011 Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) tournament, and serving as an Alternate Captain and Captain during his junior and senior year respectively. By the end of his collegiate career Hirschfeld scored 70 points over 134 games played, solidifying his reputation as a point producer. But now it was time for the pro leagues and the biggest challenge of his career.

During the 2011-12 AHL season Hirschfeld got a small taste of professional hockey when he appeared in one game for the Portland Pirates. The following year is when Alden really broke through, playing in 55 games between the AHL Providence Bruins and the ECHL South Carolina Stingrays. Then Alden finally got the chance to play for his hometown Walleye. During the offseason between the 2013 playoffs and 2014 season he joined the Toledo Walleye, where he would end up splitting games between Toledo and the AHL affiliate Grand Rapids Griffins for the next two seasons. Hirschfeld had reached the high point in his professional career, with only the normal bumps and bruises experienced by all hockey players. By this point in his professional career he had 120 career points across 221 games played. Adversity, however, finally caught up with Alden on January 8, 2016 while playing a game for the Griffins against the Milwaukee Admirals. Late in the second period Alden suffered a seizure on the bench and collapsed. Play was immediately stopped as the medical staff attended to him. Both teams were sent to their locker rooms, and Hirschfeld was stabilized before being stretchered off the ice and taken to a nearby hospital. This was the end of hockey for Hirschfeld during the 2015-16 season, and many thought he would have to hang up the skates altogether. Testing showed that there was a malformation in the left temporal lobe of Hirschfeld’s brain that was responsible for the seizure. So Alden had a choice to make: risk brain surgery to end the possibility of seizures that could also restart his hockey career, or avoid a dangerous procedure that could lead to serious unforeseen consequences in order to be there for his family. After all, at this point in his life Alden had to be concerned for the welfare if his wife and child, his child was a little over a year old. On March 14th, his decision was set into motion and Alden underwent brain surgery.

Following Hirschfeld’s surgery he posted a picture of his scalp where the doctors performed the procedure on his Twitter account.

The procedure used is called a craniotomy, which includes the removal of a piece of skull to gain access to the brain, followed by the removal of the malformed section of the temporal lobe. Following the surgery Hirschfeld returned home to Sylvania to recover with his family. Since the procedure there has been no reoccurrence of seizures, and no emergence of surgical complications. Step one was complete for Alden, to receive treatment and recover. Next up on the list? Return to hockey. Alden began training late in May to return to the sport he loved. Motivated by family, friends, teammates past and present, Hirsch regained the strength and conditioning needed to play professional hockey. After months of work all he needed was medical clearance. And he got it. On October 3rd, 2016 Alden Hirschfeld and the Toledo Walleye announced they had agreed to terms for the 2016-17 season. He participated in the Walleye training camp and preseason games against Kalamazoo, and rode with the team down to Atlanta to begin the season on the road as a first line center. During Toledo’s first game of the year against the Gladiators Hirschfeld scored the first goal for the Walleye shortly into the second period to cut the deficit 2-1. Though the Walleye would go on to lose their opener 4-1, what Hirschfeld accomplished that October 14th night will never be forgotten by the team and fans alike. Through three games Hirsch has five points with two goals and a +/- of 4. The courage and resolve that he has shown throughout this process is profound, and nobody could think of a better way to start the year than with his goal. Hopefully he can be properly rewarded with a Kelly Cup this year. Hirschfeld stands as an inspiration to not only the Toledo Walleye, but anyone who has had to deal with adversity throughout their life. He could have let his condition beat him, instead Hirsch used it to make him stronger. Toledo’s home opener is this Saturday, October 22nd. I cannot wait to hear the crowd as Alden Hirschfeld is introduced to the Huntington Center once again. Not just as a Toledo Walleye though, as a Toledo Warrior.

How to persuade a customer to use high-quality equipment?

At any negotiations, presentations of GPS equipment at various events and exhibitions, the most frequently asked question is ""how much is it?"".

Does this mean that price is the most important factor for making a purchase? Not at all, because in the B2B market the buyer spends the company's money, not his own. Therefore, the sensitivity to the price is not so high – no one is chasing for say $20 savings, it is much more important to choose a technological solution that will last for many years, and not cause a ""headache"".

If we are talking about the choice of GPS tracking device, among the most crucial factors are: reliability, longevity, functionality, as well as flexibility, i.e. the possibility of making improvements over time.

Choose a first-class solution

Choosing high-quality equipment, the end customer avoids additional costs for complete replacement of equipment (cheap tracking devices are unlikely to last longer than 2 years), costs for diagnostics, repairs and site visits for service.

Considering the rapid technological progress, it is much more efficient to invest in flexible solutions, with sufficient extensibility to implement any changes. Multifunctionality is a must in the context of the growth of customers' needs.

In other words, high-quality equipment operates on the ""set and forget"" principle. Using Galileosky tracking devices, integrators around the world get higher margins, are confident in the proposed solution, and customers remain satisfied and develop long-term cooperation. Recommending Galileosky, integrators are remembered by end users as experts who offer a high-quality and exclusive solution.

Never start negotiations with the price

One of the most important rules for winning projects is never to start negotiations with the price. Choose the best product for your customer and be confident in what you offer. Remember, the loyal customer will recommend your services to others and you will get even more projects.

Be an expert

When you know, what you sell the customer feels it. The more you know – the more customers you can attract. Keep studying the product to understand the technical characteristics and capabilities of the tracking device. Become a Galileosky expert, visiting free webinars and seminars, studying the instructions for connecting new external devices. Take the trackers for a free test to experience first-hand all the possibilities.

Be different from others

When proposing a solution, focus on unique advantages of equipment. Tell your customer about the innovative development of Galileosky – Easy Logic technology; explain the possibilities of flexible settings and configuration on-the-air. Just show the track to the customer, this is the best indicator of the quality.

Emphasize that Galileosky equipment is remarkable for a large number of inputs/outputs of different types and has an open protocol. So, you can connect and integrate various additional devices to solve almost any tasks, use monitoring software to your taste or painlessly replace one software for another.

Get to know your customer better

Having discussed the advantages of the product, try to find out what the customer needs and wants. At this stage, it is the right time not only to draw up a detailed ""portrait"" of the tracking device in terms of technical parameters, but also to find out the required installation time and availability of a product. Once you find it out feel free to discuss the price. Do not forget that Galileosky can provide custom-made trackers, therefore, you will not have to overpay for unnecessary functionality.

Handle the objections

Do not leave the customer's objections unanswered. ""Expensive""? Explain why it is worth buying. Considering the practice of using Galileosky GPS devices, the investment pays off after the first month. The longer service life of the solution – the higher ROI is. Galileosky hardware is one of the most reliable and durable on the market. It’s estimated service life is 10 years and the reject rate is less than 1% of all released products.

The customer claims that the solution is ""excessively functional""? Clarify, how easier it will be to upgrade the solution in the future, than to re-equip everything from scratch. Provide examples of more significant economic results when implementing a non-standard solution. And, finally, offer to pay only for the required functionality by ordering custom-made devices.

If, as an argument, the end user states that he does not want to use hardware and software from different manufacturers, explain that you choose only the best components of the monitoring system from companies that specialize in their fields. Thus, the system will be more qualitative and flexible.

Call the manufacturer for assistance

Do not neglect the help of the manufacturer, even if you have rich experience in transport monitoring. The personal Galileosky manager will provide comprehensive support. From assessing the technical requirements of the end user, discussing the customization conditions and to joint participation in negotiations with customers or making presentation together online.

In addition, Galileosky is ready to discuss mutual exhibiting, provides free marketing materials to partners, and redirects the requests of end customers for the purchase and installation of trackers to reliable integrators in the regions.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Understanding credit car finance

Cars are essential for the day to day life but only a few can manage to get money needed to buy a car on an instant. This is because quality cars are quite costly and it is not always easy to have such an amount of cash stacked up in a bank account or in your savings. It would be unwise to get a cheap low cost car that is of poor quality and is not able to guarantee smooth sailing all the time. Car finance companies like
CarFinanceCity.co.uk
offer clients the ability to buy a car through finance offered by lenders. The lenders are established organizations that work along with car dealers enabling applicants to get a car or choice based on loan. The applicant gets to drive away a car of choice and is liable to pay for it by means of weekly or monthly installments over a specified period of time.

Stabikes Finance is liable to selling clients good quality cars at reasonable prices while making arrangements to have the car dealer offer the car to the client. We help spread the car repayment over a span of months or years helping you make easy payments for the car as you use it. This has made it possible for all to have cars of their choice with ease.

Stabikes Finance is listed among the top service providers offering bad credit finance.

Turning our focus to such possibilities has enabled us to advance car financing to bad credit debt worthy individuals.

Stabikes Finance has a wide range of packages that are ideal for bad credit car financing.

"Daniel Talks About, Flirting, Height, Drinking Issues & Other Stuff!

Daniel Radcliffe, the 26 years old actor, who once played the epic role of Harry Potter, recently spoke about the much adult stuff, like flirting, girlfriend, masturbation and alcohol issues and may other things during his interview with the Playboy magazine.

The 1.65 m tall British actor opened about his struggles dealing with fame, young age drinking , his inability to say 'no', and everything about his 8 Harry Potter series. He also used the platform to talk about his girlfriend Erin Darke.

Daniel did a 20 Q and A with Playboy. Below are a few of the questions and Daniel's brilliant answers combined with his simple and down to earth attitude that caught our attention. We must say, the actor does have an excellent sense of humour.

Daniel said:

On when he drank heavily at a very young age to deal with fame ..

""Anytime I'd go out to dance, camera phones would come out. That would make me very self-conscious, and what's the easiest way to escape being self-conscious? Alcohol is a quick way of doing that. So it was related in that way.""

He also added ""A few years ago there was a TV ad that showed a lot of inventors, including a guy who invented the camera phone. He was smiling smugly into the camera, and I was just like, Fuck you. What have you wrought? Camera phones are definitely not my favorite.""

On whether there was time to masturbate on the sets

Daniel jokingly said, ""Yeah, I was like every other teenager in that sense. My favorite line about masturbation is Louis C.K.'s, something like, ""I found out about it when I was 11, and I didn't skip a day."" I think I started very early-before my teens. But not when I was on set.""

On his height issues in Hollywood ..

The actor said, ""I don't think so. Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise have very different careers, and they're both about the same height as I am. I could play a soldier. The minimum height for a marine is five feet, and I'm well above that. If you're asking, ‘Can you play a really (bleeping) tall person?' No, obviously not.""

On when he first met his girlfriend and flirting ..

Daniel gushed about his incredibly smart and funny girlfriend. He spoke about the time he first met her on the sets in 2013 and said ""That's a wonderful record of us flirting for the first time. There's no acting going on - not from my end, anyway. There's a moment when she makes me laugh, and I'm laughing as me and not as my character.""

From height to masturbating and gushing about his girlfriend, Daniel rocked the interview and nailed every single question he was asked. He can now look forward to seeing the Harry Potter protagonist in many other roles in the near future and add more fiction characters to our list of favorites.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Since a recent Stanford study showed that students at practically all grade levels can't determine fake news from the real stuff, the push to teach media literacy has gained new momentum. The study showed that while students absorb media constantly, they often lack the critical thinking skills needed to tell fake news from the real stuff.

Teachers are taking up the challenge to change that. NPR Ed put out a social media call asking how educators are teaching fake news and media literacy, and we got a lot of responses. Here's a sampling from around the country:

Fake news ""Simon Says""

In Scott Bedley's version of Simon Says, it's not those two magic words that keep you in the game, but deciding correctly whether a news story is real or not.

To start off the game, Bedley sends his fifth-graders at Plaza Vista School in Irvine, Calif., an article to read on their laptops. He gives them about three minutes to make their decision — they have to read the story carefully, examine its source and use their judgment. Those who think the article is false, stand up. The ""true"" believers stay in their seats.

Bedley says he's been trying to teach his students for a while to look carefully at what they're reading and where it comes from. He's got a seven-point checklist his students can follow:

1. Do you know who the source is, or was it created by a common or well-known source? Example National Geographic, Discovery, etc.2. How does it compare to what you already know?3. Does the information make sense? Do you understand the information?4. Can you verify that the information agrees with three or more other sources that are also reliable?5. Have experts in the field been connected to it or authored the information?6. How current is the information?7. Does it have a copyright?

Subtle changes

Bedley also teamed up recently with Todd Flory at Wheatland Elementary School in Wichita, Kan., to do a fake news challenge via Skype. Flory's fourth-graders chose two real articles and wrote a fake article of their own. Then, they presented them to Bedley's class in California.

The fifth-graders had four minutes to do some extra research based on the presentations, and then they decided which article out of the three were fake. Most importantly, they had to explain why they thought it was fake. Otherwise, no points.

Flory says writing the fake news article was more difficult for his students than they expected because they had to make it believable.

""It really hammered home the idea to them that fake news doesn't have to be too sensational,"" he says. ""It can be a very subtle change, but that subtle change can have big consequences.""

Every Friday, Flory's class participates in what he calls Genius Hour. His students propose a question to answer through online research. But before they took to the Internet, Flory had to walk his students through the steps: What are reliable and trusted websites? How do you effectively search on the Internet and verify information?

He uses Skype to connect his students with researchers and scientists from all over the world. He calls this ""authentic research.""

""It's so much more powerful for them to do some of this authentic research when they're able to hear from a scientist who's seeing firsthand the effects of climate change,"" Flory says. This year's class got to talk to a penguin scientist.

Flory says he's not only teaching his students effective media literacy skills; he is also helping them to be better citizens through global engagement and interaction.

Let them eat fake (news)

Remember Marie Antoinette and ""Let them eat cake"" — her famous line about the poor that got her in all that trouble?

Thing is, it never happened. Fake news!

For Diane Morey and her ninth-graders at Danvers High School in Danvers, Mass., that's a teachable moment.

""The media of the day didn't have Facebook, Twitter or partisan websites,"" Morey says. ""But they did have pamphlets.""

She shows her class cartoons and pamphlets from the French Revolutionary period that criticized Antoinette, and then discusses the conclusions that were made from those sources. She also includes a primary source: a letter written by Antoinette.

Morey says history is rich with examples of fake news, and since source analysis is the core of her lesson plans, she doesn't need a textbook.

""We don't study [history] to memorize Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI,"" she explains. ""We're studying this because we can see this happening in the current-day political climate.""

Morey encourages students to bring in examples of articles from today's news that don't ring true.

""Once you expose it to them,"" she says, ""it's like a game for them, seeing, 'Hey, I'm not sure I can trust this.' ""

Extra layers

For 13 years, Larry Ferlazzo has been teaching kids who are learning English how to read and write. Now, he's adding another layer: helping them figure out if what they're reading is true.

Last month, he wrote a lesson plan on addressing fake news to English language learners (ELLs), which was published in The New York Times.

He says media literacy is especially important for ELLs for two reasons. First, they're not fluent in the language they're reading, adding an extra level of difficulty in deciding what to believe. On top of that, false or exaggerated news about immigration could have a major impact on their lives.

His lesson starts off with a few examples of reliable and fake news. Then, some basic journalism stuff: Students identify the different parts of the news, from the ""lede"" to quotations. They enter all that into a diagram on paper so they have a visual representation of what they're reading.

That diagram eventually becomes a guide for students to write their own fake news lede that they can share with other classmates or post on a class blog.

Media consumers and contributors

In 2015, Spencer Brayton and his colleague Natasha Casey revamped a media literacy course for students at Blackburn College in Carlinville, Ill. Brayton says the key is the critical approach.

""Students come in expecting that we're going to lecture,"" Brayton explains. ""But we have them think about certain power structures in how information is produced and how it reaches them. If they're going to understand how they're going to take it in, then they have to know how the news is going to be produced.""

To take the class, students need a Twitter account. From the very first week, they are asked to follow five to 10 accounts on Twitter that promote media and information literacy, like Media Literacy Now or Renee Hobbs.

As they follow these posts and add additional ones, the goal is that they'll start to recognize fake news and other biases or viewpoints in media.

By the end of the course, Brayton says students begin to see themselves not only as creators of information, but as credible sources of information too.

The Twitter assignments encourage his students to engage with social media - retweeting, following and commenting — which Brayton says helps his students see how they play a role in spreading information to other media consumers. That means they have to take what they share more seriously.

""In looking at this issue, people seem to want a quick solution to fake news, but I'm not sure there is a solution (at least an easy one),"" Brayton writes in an email. ""Students need to recognize that these skills and ideas need to stay with them through adulthood, but that's easier said than done — we all fall into this trap.""",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"""There's no doubting the footballs been shite."" Exactly Harry, wtf have i been saying and getting dogs abuse from you for two seasons? You haven't been saying that for two years you've been spouting 'Trust in Jose' and trying to claim that games that have been shite have been great and that every fucker is to blame but Jose. I'm not calling for his head i'm calling for better more consistent football. Give the players a chance to be attacking, creative, brave. And stop crowing about beating average or worse teams.

Jose should expect Pogba to be disiplined / capable of a variation in midfield play ,he ain't exactly asking him to play in goal or right back , he may not be as effective in that place but that's up to Jose where he gets the best out of the lad .

The jury is out on where Pogba should play but that ain't Jose's , fault for me I think he should be a numb 10 behind in the present side Sanchez, but then Jose is relying to much on Matic , has Fellani injured ( and possibly in the departure lounge) Herrera not good enough but ultimately have to use him the kid who played Sat plus Carrick finished and a makeshift Blind.

As for the MEN article the manager was criticised for publicly calling out players early season and when he gives them encouragement in public he gets a pelter too?

""There's no doubting the footballs been shite."" Exactly Harry, wtf have i been saying and getting dogs abuse from you for two seasons? You haven't been saying that for two years you've been spouting 'Trust in Jose' and trying to claim that games that have been shite have been great and that every fucker is to blame but Jose. I'm not calling for his head i'm calling for better more consistent football. Give the players a chance to be attacking, creative, brave. And stop crowing about beating average or worse teams.

Belt up you big tart. What the fuck do you know about consistency. It doesn't matter how they've played you've always found time to slate Joey. End of.

I saw that Jose said something about the need to work on our ""attacking dynamic"", or something like that, after the last game. I'm glad that he recognises that. Sanchez is a good player who improves our forward line, but it really doesn't look like it's more than the sum of its parts, it's just three (or four) individual players doing their thing.

We were banging in the goals in the first month of the season, but our scoring rate has been gradually dribbling downward since then. In fact, after the first six games, which we did really well in, our record for the past 20 games is exactly the same as Liverpool's.

""Despite his reputation, United manager's faith in youth has put Guardiola in the shade""

It was mostly overlooked at the time, a casualty of the fanfare surrounding Alexis Sanchez's signing a few days earlier, but when Manchester United announced Jose Mourinho had signed a new contract last month, there was a line from the club's executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, praising the manager's commitment to blooding youth.""He has embraced the club's desire to promote top quality young players to the first team,"" said Woodward, a pointed response to those who suggested the Portuguese would pay little more than lip service to the club's rich traditions of cultivating home-grown talent.Those suggestions had solid enough foundations. For all the success Mourinho's managerial career has brought him, there has been a perennial black splodge next to the box marked youth development and no one has been more aware of this than the man himself.It has felt very different at United, though, and while entrenched reputations can take a long time to change, certain perceptions are, for now at least, being challenged.There has been an understandable rush to measure Mourinho and United's every move against what Pep Guardiola has been doing at Manchester City. But while Guardiola has raised all sorts of bars this term, there is a certain irony that Mourinho - ""the monster that kills the little kids"" as he sarcastically described himself last week - has bought into the academy ethos in a way his great adversary, often heralded as a champion of youth, has yet to do with any particular conviction down the road.Tomorrow marks the 60th anniversary of the Munich air disaster, and on a weekend when United supporters honoured the memory of the Busby Babes - one of the ultimate symbols of the potency of youth - there was something rather poignant about Mourinho dropping Paul Pogba and playing academy graduate Scott McTominay in the £89million man's place against Huddersfield.Before anyone hints at an ulterior motive there, it is worth remembering that Mourinho has never been one for sentiment and that McTominay had already made more starts this season than the entirety of the five academy graduates at City who have fleetingly tasted first-team football under Guardiola since August. Note, too, that Marcus Rashford has made more appearances - 90 - than anyone since Mourinho took charge at United and another academy graduate, Jesse Lingard, who has also flourished, is fourth on that list.While Mourinho was extolling the virtues of McTominay, or the ""kid"" as he affectionately calls him, Guardiola was whining about not having enough players in the wake of a mounting injury list and a failed move for Riyad Mahrez, and reiterated the point with a grimly petty decision to name only six substitutes against Burnley.Such arguments really do not hold much sway when you have spent £450 million in 19 months and have an academy awash with exciting talents, any number of whom would have benefited from the experience of a match-day with the first-team squad. ""If you're the academy or reserve-team manager at Manchester City, you must think, 'I'm wasting my time',"" said Gary Neville, the former United defender and Sky Sports pundit. ""Rather than saying in an interview, 'I haven't got the players', he could say he's brought a young player from the youth team who has been wonderful this season. It's really poor. And I can guarantee you the youth-team coach and reserve-team coach at Manchester City will feel disheartened by him having six players on the bench.""It was a wretched move Mourinho's critics might have once expected him to make but the tide seems to be turning.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Tag: crocodiles

Crocodiles like to lurk in the shallows, preparing to pounce. They are not, as a general rule, strong enough swimmers to go on extended ocean cruises whenever they feel like it. Despite this, these creatures managed to reach islands across the South Pacific. How?

Surfing.

A group of scientists led by Craig Franklin, and including the late “Crocodile Hunter” Steve Irwin, studied saltwater crocs from the Kennedy River area of Northeastern Australia for about a year for a study forthcoming in the Journal of Animal Ecology. The team tagged 20 animals with receivers to give both their position and body temperature.

They found that eight crocodiles undertook a total of 42 long-distance journeys of more than 10 kilometres [6.2 miles] per day. In 96% of these trips, the reptiles traveled with the current flow. In contrast, the crocodiles were equally likely to travel with and against the current flow when making short journeys [Nature].

The body temperature reading gave the scientists another way to verify this, besides matching croc travel habits to changing ocean currents. When the tide went against the crocs, they just hung out on the beach and their body temperature rose to 90 degrees F as they soaked up the sun. However, when the current became favorable and they went traveling, their temperatures descended to more like 77 degrees.

A thrilling set of ancient crocodile fossils have been unearthed in northern Africa. A “saber-toothed cat in armor” and a pancake-shaped predator are among the strange crocodile cousins whose bones have been found beneath the windswept dunes of the Sahara, archaeologists say [National Geographic News].

At a news conference organized by the National Geographic Society, which sponsored the research, scientists announced that the fossils represent 5 species; 3 new species and 2 that were previously known. These ancient croc ancestors, known as crocodilyforms, are unlike any crocodiles encountered in the Northern Hemisphere, according to the research team. Their findings are detailed in the journal ZooKeys.

The crocs were spectacularly diverse, and included a species that ate dinosaurs, two that grew up to 20 feet long, and two that had long legs for quick movement on land but also had long tails for swimming. The three new species are:

• BoarCroc (Kaprosuchus saharicus), a 20-foot meat-eater. It used its snout for ramming and three sets of dagger-shaped fangs for slicing dinosaurs it ate.

• PancakeCroc (Laganosuchus thaumastos): a 20-foot-long, squat fish-eater with a 3-foot long flat head with spike-shaped teeth.

Who knew that baby crocodiles are such tender little creatures? According to researchers, they start crying out for their mothers before they’ve even cracked their shells and poked their long noses out into the world: The little crocs make an “umph! umph! umph!” sound right before they hatch [Reuters]. Now a study has shown that the noises they make from within their shells aren’t just idle chatter, but instead play an important role in the hatching.

A team of French researchers studied Nile crocodiles, and found that the calls prompted mother crocodiles to dig the eggs out of the dirt. The cries also seemed to alert all the babies inside their shells that it was time to hatch, leading to a neatly synchronized hatching that could have an evolutionary benefit, researchers say.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Another way I have found to significantly extend my battery life is Ease of Access . This “side effect” IS NOT reflected in the Estimated Time Remaining which is updated when you turn batter saver on. The key to this is AMOLED.

Ease of Access allows you to turn high contrast on. This feature changes the colors for some features, and hides some of their background images. A lot of mobile phones today use AMOLED displays, which according to Wikipedia its power consumption is based on color displayed.

“The amount of power the display consumes varies significantly depending on the colour and brightness shown. As an example, one commercial QVGA OLED display consumes 0.3 watts while showing white text on a black background, but more than 0.7 watts showing black text on a white background, while an LCD may consume only a constant 0.35 watts regardless of what is being shown on screen.[10] Because the black pixels actually turn off, AMOLED also has contrast ratios that are significantly better than LCD.”

Ease of Access turns off a large percentage of the screen to black (including no lock screen image) and in the process extending battery life significantly (this assertion is based on experience no empirical measurements). In fact, I use it permanently now not only for the benefit of battery life but it makes my phone look more eccentric.

Here is what the start page looks like under both settings.

Ease of Access on

Only apps using system colors are affected when the setting is turn on.

Steps to turning Ease of Access:

NEW DELHI: The aviation ministry has opposed the government’s demand for all of the Airports Authority of India’s profit for fiscal 2018 to be paid as dividend. The state-owned airport operator needs money to fund upgrades and expansion, aviation minister Suresh Prabhu said in a note to finance minister Arun Jaitley that was sent last month, said a senior government official.

“Exemption from payment of full profit as dividend has been sought on grounds that AAI has to invest a lot of money in upgrades at various airports and this money would be required over and above the money that we are planning to raise,” said the official, who did not want to be identified.

The government, through the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), has sought payment of profits in their entirety by government-owned companies as dividend. The move has been resisted by others PSUs too.

AAI has vast infrastructure plans as it looks to meet the requirements of the country’s aviation market, which has been growing in double digits for over four years now, putting pressure on existing facilities. It’s in the process of raising Rs 9,500 crore over a period of three years from the market to meet these upgrade costs.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"reconciliation songs

My morning introspection had a catalyst. Barenaked Ladies’ new song ‘War On Drugs.’ The song verbalizes the exact changes I’m making in myself. Letting the tug-of-war relationships of my past go, ridding myself of the guilt and shame… saying goodbye to the demons haunting me, that kept me such company. Maybe it will be dull without all this drama, and maybe it will be odd to make myself happy, like I always thought I was supposed to feel, but never seemed to be. So one point for me.

I’m listening to Coldplay’s The Sceintist as I write this. Any song where a man is starting his sentence with “I’m sorry” is a good one. A song about reconciliation. Well done. I like men who show up in the middle of the night if you’re fighting on the phone, or the guy who when you sneak out of his apartment, chases you into the street, finds you in a cab and pleads for you to please come back inside… “there are things that need to be said.” I guess I love people who can realize they’re making mistakes before they make them. Romantics who know what to do if they ever are in a relationship.

Nobody said it was easy. It’s such a shame for us to part. Nobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be this hard.

I love reconciliation. I just always thought it would be with a boy; I never thought I’d be reconciling with myself.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Construction market statistics can be used to make informed decisions on market development

Construction market statistics provide government, industry, and associations with a basis for making decisions on strategic direction and investments. For example, in the past a strong understanding of residential and non-residential statistics in Canada and the US contributed to the successful development of the wood mid-rise construction sector. Today, market statistics help guide the approach to tall wood construction.

Unfortunately, there is not adequate construction data in China at this time put forward a similar data-based strategy for market development. Better information of building size, height, and material would provide key insights into where the opportunities for wood construction are. This enhanced market knowledge would not only benefit industry, but it could provide Chinese planners with insights on how a shift to wood construction could potentially reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment.

What do we know?

China already has good data available to provide us insights on the health of the construction market. For example, in 2014, China started 1.25 billion square metres of residential construction. In the same year 1.05 billion square metres of new residential construction was sold, accounting for 10.1 million housing units. When building common areas are accounted for (assuming 20% of floor area is not saleable) this puts the Chinese real estate market as a whole in relative balance in 2014.

We are also able to break this information down on a more granular level (provincial/regional/municipal). Using this approach, we know that there are vast regional differences as the ratio of construction sold –to-started varies. In Shanghai, during 2014, 1.44 square metres of completed and future residential construction was sold for every 1 metre that was started, indicating high future construction activity. On the other hand, in Shanxi the overall ratio of sales to starts was only 0.65, indicating low demand.

However, while this type of data is a good indicator of market activity, it provides little information for targeting wood building systems to specific markets.

Figure 1 – Ratio of residential floor area sold to started 2013/2014 (assumes 20% of floor area started is common area).

Figure 2 Number of Housing Units Sold 2014

What do we need to develop an understanding of the wood construction sector?

There are a number of key statistics that would help in the development of strategies around wood construction. It is hoped that in the coming months Canada Wood, with assistance from FPInnovations, will conduct an investigation with MOHURD to determine the feasibility of collecting additional statistics. Examples of statistics that would be useful include:

Number of buildings started

Statistics by number of storeys (floor area and number of units)

Units started

Primary construction material

In China the challenge is this data lies with thousands of local permitting offices across the country. A system needs to be developed to funnel the data into a centralized location. The next step is to collaborate with one single municipal department to learn what statistics they currently collect and to see what they are willing to share. Once we understand what is possible to do with a single jurisdiction, we can start to consider how to consolidate construction data from across the country. Through addressing statistics of common interest for both MOHURD and Canada Wood this initiative is most likely to move forward.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Tattoo Crosses

Here we have a clean and simple, and recently tattooed, Gothic iron cross tattoo. Many tattoo crosses can have a clutter and other images mixed up with them but I tend to admire the cleanliness of this one. This simple cross is basic to the Gothic Iron Cross but is rendered in a thick-and-thin beveled line that lends itself well to the tattoo medium. The stark simplicity is its most memorable attribute. It is also meant to stand for a dagger of a type, a dagger for God’s work if you will, and that is why it has a point at its bottom.

This is a very sharp looking gothic cross and I like it very much. I am the type of person who likes very slick, clean lines and for me the simpler something is, the better. If I were out and about and looking to get myself any kind of cross tattoo put on myself this is exactly what I would get. Because after seeing all of the tattoo crosses I have seen, and believe me, I have seen a lot of them, this one is what appeals to me the most.

This is a whole selection of different tattoo crosses. The style that a person may be interested in depends on their personality and the meaning they attribute to the designs. Since their are so many tattoo crosses to choose from, let me give you a rundown of the two most popular ones. It’s a good starting point for your research. The Latin Cross is highly recognizable in the world of tattoos, as it is comprised of a vertical line intersected at right angles by a shorter horizontal line positioned around 1/3 of the way from the top. This uncomplicated design is often associated with Christianity and is frequently used to pay tribute to others. One of the most attractively designed crosses is the Celtic selection, where a knot is created in the space where both lines cross. The Gothic Cross mirrors the German style of elaborate wrought iron work displayed during the Edwardian and Victorian periods. This type of cross is often used to express pain, anger, and the Goth culture. Many designs associated with the Gothic Cross utilize dark imagery, such as barbed wire and daggers. Now, that you have a little background you can do a search on the internet and see if those are the designs you like and maybe even find a few more.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Had a great day here, its a proper little sun trap and out the wind.

I do reccomend this one if your in the area. Lots of Cast wheels and bits and bobs along the imediate shoreline also.

The works as you see it today is not as it was in the late 19th Century. Most of the existing site was constructed at the turn of the 20th Century and evolved from there onwards according to refinement of the techniques for making the bricks. Mining by manual endeavor lasted from around 1850 to 1914, even though the Porth Wen brick works was taken over by a German named Herr Steibel in 1906. Now Herr Steibel would never have undertaken the management of the works unless he believed there would be a profitable return for his endeavours. Poor Misguided Fool. Herr Steibel’s tenure only lasted until 1908 when a Charles Tidy took over. Progress in manufacture revealed itself in how the individual bricks were made. Unlike Herr Steibel, who had continued with the traditional moulding and wire cutting into shape, Mr. Tidy used a simple shape pressing technique that cut out a time-consuming and therefore expensive stage of production. However, because of technical – or was it personality issues, as alleged elsewhere - the quality of the final product declined markedly and the work at Porth Wen came to an end in 1914. The beginning of the First World war should have been a profitable time serving the wartime steel industry; nonetheless, it failed. The brickworks remained unused until 1924. Production struggled on until 1949 when they finally gave up the ghost.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Commentary: High-speed rail project is a train wreck

By Keith Curry

1:55 PM PDT, March 21, 2014

Advertisement

As a financial advisor to governments, your job is to tell sometimes hard truths about the financial implications of public plans. Governments ignore these financial consequences at the peril of taxpayers and long-term financial health.

Unfortunately, the California High-Speed Rail Authority's financial plan, as it is currently conceived, ignores some hard truths. It would be a slow-moving train wreck that would do economic damage to California for generations.

I should know. Fifteen years ago, I was the financial advisor to California High-Speed Rail.

In 1999, the system was estimated to cost $24 billion to $34 billion and take 10 years to construct from downtown San Francisco to downtown Los Angeles. In looking at the various means available to the state to finance the project, it quickly became apparent to us that system revenues were too speculative and too far off in the future to be the basis of a financial strategy.

At that time, train fares were estimated to be 60% of airfares between L.A. and the Bay Area. It was a time when air costs were higher (pre-Southwest expansion), and the key assumption was a less-than-three-hour travel time from city center to city center. Now, flight costs are actually lower in real terms, the travel time significantly longer, and the proposed system does not come anywhere close to connecting the city centers.

In order to actually generate the construction funding required, we identified the fact that the system must seek its own dedicated funding source. Trying to use existing funding sources would simply take funds away from schools and other important state priorities. We specifically determined that trying to use state general obligation bonds would not be feasible and would exhaust the state's borrowing capacity and unfairly crowd out funding for water, highways and schools.

If the state wanted to build this project, we said, it needed to be honest with Californians and ask them to consider enacting a dedicated funding source. We advised the rail authority to give voters the ability to decide for themselves, with all the financial pros and cons on the table, whether this project was worthy.

So-called ""manna from heaven"" strategies, where assumptions were made about magic ""private investment,"" would have been a dishonest approach to real project funding. At that time, a statewide quarter-cent sales tax, among other options, would have been sufficient, given the engineering estimates. Our job as financial advisors was to identify a strategy that would actually work, not one that would deceive the voters.

Of course the state ignored our advice. Then-state Sen. Jim Costa passed a general obligation (GO) bond authorization for $9.9 billion that was narrowly approved by the voters. The Obama administration briefly offered a small amount of high-speed rail grant funding. California alone bit on this offer of federal support.

State GO bonds are not a funding source; they are debt proceeds that must be paid back. The annual debt service on $9.9 billion would add approximately $650 million to the state budget each year for 30 years. While the state could receive a little over $3 billion in federal grant funds, federal requirements require repayment if the project is not completed as promised. Today's project business plan does indeed rely on ""manna from heaven"" in the form of imagined ""private investment"" once the project is underway.

In the meantime, project costs have soared as the route has been adjusted to respond to political pressure. Passenger revenue estimates drop when travel time and end-to-end accessibility are sacrificed. Even if the state was to finance the full $9.9 billion and get all the federal grants, the project would still be $55 billion short of completion, and that is an optimistic number.

Ridership constrained to just the Central Valley would produce an operating deficit, which would further exacerbate the state-funding drain. If the project was not completed as projected (a likely scenario), the federal government would seek reimbursement of its $3 billion.

The project could not be built without a tax increase in 1999, and it cannot be built today without raising taxes, which I strongly oppose. Gov. Jerry Brown should level with the voters about this hard fact before this project becomes a financial train wreck that would saddle future generations with substantial debt and no real improvements in mobility or economic growth. Let's pull the switch before it is too late.

WHAT IS DIGITAL ADVERTISING AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT

Digital advertising is the tactic of leveraging the internet and its properties to deliver promotional ads to consumers on various channels

Like its predecessor—traditional advertising—a digital ad can help tell the story of your brand. Unlike traditional advertising, digital advertising is universal and flexible, enabling you to tell your business story or feature your golf course on the channels that your buyers frequent—through text, images, video, and more. Digital advertising has evolved considerably since the first clickable ad hit the internet in 1994. Today, instead of advertising creating noise that distracts from the content your buyers want to read, digital advertising can be part of an ongoing conversation that your Golf Course or business has with its customers. Digital ads are everywhere. They can be seen on the websites your buyer visits, on his or her’s mobile phone, on social media channels, and on his or her’s smartwatch. Because advertising proliferates across so many channels, including very personal channels, you need to be more cognizant than ever before about providing useful, engaging content. Luckily, due to behavioral targeting technologies and our engaging drone video platforms, these continuous conversations are possible. And by leveraging these technologies at scale, you can nurture your buyers in a very personalized way until they are ready to become customers. As Golf Guide marketers, we may feel like we have come a long way with digital advertising, but we are still in the early stages. With digital advertising continuing to gain momentum, it is more vital than ever before to make it an integral part of your holistic marketing mix.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"NHAI to develop Paradip-Daitary highway.

With Paradip-Daitary expressway in Odisha in pathetic shape, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) has decided to develop the highway on an 'Operate-Maintain Transfer' (OMT) mode, NHAI officials said.

The tender-bidding process is on to hand over the maintenance work of the highway to a private firm. The contract would be for six years to repair and maintain the highway. As the highway is in bad shape in certain patches, a local construction company has been entrusted to undertake repair till OMT bid is finalised, the officials said.

The busy highway otherwise called as Paradip-Daitary expressway incidentally happens to be the principal road between the mineral-rich areas and Paradip port, a stretch of 77 km. Replete with potholes, the highway has come under roadside encroachment at strategic traffic junctions.

A 10-KM stretch of the road, (Bhutamundai to Atharbanki), is not in a motorable condition and one has to undergo a bitter experience at many places on the road as the road is replete with hundreds of potholes.

Islamic thought has experienced much advancement since the time of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him); with the emergence of new schools of thoughts such as the Mu’tazila, the bewildering world of Sufism, etc. At the same time, a Muslim is inclined to ask the question: Was it true advancement? After all, knowledge as it were, was complete with the Holy Qur’an. Why search for more? – The answer is provided by the Qur’an; as Allah says to the Prophet of Islam, “Say: O Lord! Give me more knowledge! (Surah 20)”

The Prophet Muhammad had said, “Seek knowledge even if you must go to China.” Hence, the scientists and scholars of Islam left no stone unturned to seek greater knowledge about the heavens and the earth. The ordinary believers who may not spend as much time with knowledge as do the saints, scientists, and scholars; were left to answer the essential question for themselves: Who is more correct – the scientist, the scholar, or the saint? Also in Islam there are various schools of thought teaching dissimilar albeit similar modes of the five daily prayers, e.g. Hanafi, Shafi, etc. To add to the variety of practices from which to choose, the modern-day cosmopolitan youth is confronted by a host of global religions, some of which remind him about truth that is intrinsic to the soul.

Allah says in the Qur’an: “Those who believe and those who are Jews, Christians and Sabeans, [in fact] anyone who believes in God and the Last Day, and acts honorably will receive their earnings from their Lord: no fear will lie upon them nor need they feel saddened” (Surah 2). The Qur’an insists on belief in oneness of God. And so, all saints, scholars and scientists of Islam in addition to the ordinary believers have one belief in common: Belief in One God, Allah Supreme, Lord of the universe. This is the heart of Islam. Belief in Muhammad as the prophet of Islam, and beliefs in the Day of Judgment as well as the unseen world of angels are also essential.

Politicians are among the richest people on earth today, virtually selling the lives of the innocent to get richer by the minute. There are serious human rights abuses around the world, thanks to political corruption. And it’s not just Zardari whom people think is out to sell Pakistan. We know the United States is extremely corrupt. When a Harvard University professor gets away with rape in the U.S. just because the person complaining of rape is a student — you know U.S. can be considered equivalent to a jungle in Africa. See http://owurapist.blogspot.com

Here’s God’s take on things:

They say: “If the Mercy-giving had so wished, we would not have worshipped them.” No matter what knowledge they may have about that, they are still merely guessing. Or have We given them a book already which they try to hold on to?

Moreover they say: “We found our forefathers following such a community and we are merely being guided along their tracks.” Just the same We have not sent any warner into a town previous to you unless its highlivers said: “We found our forefathers with such a community, and are merely being led along their tracks.” He said: “Even if I should bring you better guidance than what you found your forefathers had?”, they would say: ‘We reject anything you are sent with!”

We have been avenged on them; see what the outcome was for those who denied [it all]! (Qur’an)

Basically, the “high-livers” are too complacent to believe in truth when falsehood is working for them so well in the worldly sense. Are the innocent destroyed with the corrupt? — No, provided that they’ve consistently opposed corruption. They should be praying against the corrupt if nothing else.

We have never acted as punishers until We have despatched some messenger: yet whenever We want to wipe out some town, We order its high-livers so they act depraved in it; thus the Sentence about it is proven to be right and We utterly annihilate it. How many generations did We destroy since Noah? Sufficient is it for your Lord to be Informed, Observant of His servants’ sins! (Qur’an)

Now both the Christians and the Muslims are expecting Jesus Christ or the Mahdi to emerge during this time. Do you think he’d side with the corrupt here or there? Would he shake hands with Obama or Bush, both engaged in perpetual war and under whose leadership countless innocents are killed day after day? Or would he side with the likes of Zardari or bin Laden?

We hurry good things up for them, yet they do not even notice it! Those who feel anxious out of awe for their Lord, and those who believe in their Lord’s signs, and those who do not associate anything with their Lord, and those who give away anything they may give while their hearts feel wary lest they should return to their Lord; [all] those compete in doing good deeds and they will soon attain them.

We only assign a soul something it can cope with. Before Us lies a Book which speaks up for Truth; they will not be dealt with unjustly. Instead their hearts are full of excitement because of this. They have other deeds besides those which they are committing, so that whenever We seize their high-livers with torment, just imagine how they bellow! “Do not roar [so loud] today; you will not be supported by Us. My signs have already been recited to you while you proudly turned on your heels away from it, sitting up nights to chatter on and on about it.” (Qur’an)

God says He would not argue with the dumb.

We have sent no town a warner unless its high-livers said: “We are disbelievers in what you have been sent with.” They say: “We have more wealth and children, and will not be tormented!” SAY: “My Lord extends sustenance to anyone He wishes and budgets it, even though most men do not realize it.”

It is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you close to Us in patronage; only someone who believes and acts honorably (will do so). Those will have a double reward because of what they have done. They will feel secure in mansions while those who were attempting to thwart 0ur signs will be paraded forth into torment.

SAY: “My Lord extends sustenance to anyone He wishes among His servants and He budgets it out. He will compensate you for anything you have spent since He is the best Provider.” Some day He will summon them all together; then He will say to the angels: “Are those the ones who were worshipping you?” They will say: “Glory be to You! You are our Patron rather than they. Instead they have been worshipping sprites; most of them even believe in them!” (Qur’an)

Corrupt governments, political leaders and/or rapist professors from Harvard University or elsewhere do not wish to believe in the devil. They are devils. In fact, a book called “UFO’s in the Qur’an” claims that the U.S. government is being run by aliens or evil spirits. That’s Skull & Bones. They tell their members they’d always be protected from corruption charges. So a Harvard University professor, just because he goes to Harvard, is told he’d always be protected from rape accusations, and no matter what crime he commits, it’s going to be ok.

But this is not the way God’s government works. This is not something Jesus would stand for. Corrupt people are going to hell, and nothing can change this fact. It’s written on their foreheads, it’s their destiny. Hell? Well, they’d see it when they get there. Jesus is not their Savior. Salvation is only for good people.

Some readers may remember the 1961 film “The Day the Earth Caught Fire”. It could be viewed as the original “climate alarmist” film as it contains all of the plot elements of our current climate alarmism scenarios: exaggerated images of a dying planet, a mainstream media newspaper reporter, technology that is feared, the Met Office, and last but not least, junk science.

A new study out of MIT predicts “a 90% probability that worldwide surface temperatures will rise at least 9 degrees by 2100.“
This is more than twice what was expected in 2003. The Telegraph reports

“Global warming of 7C ‘could kill billionsthis century‘. Global temperatures could rise by more than 7C this century killing billions of people and leaving the world on the brink of total collapse, according to new research“A similar 2003 study had predicted a mere- but still significant- 4 degree increase in global temperatures by 2100, but those models weren’t nearly as comprehensive, and they didn’t take into consideration economic factors.

So what has changed since 2003 to cause the scientists at MIT’s “Centre for Global Climate Change” to believe the world is going to boil over this century and send billions of us directly to a toasty demise similar to our featured movie?

Antarctic ice has broken the record for greatest extent ever recorded.http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/current.area.south.jpg
January, 2008 broke the record for the most snow covered area ever measured in the Northern Hemisphere.http://climate.rutgers.edu/snowcover/png/monthlyanom/nhland01.pngI added a red line below showing the reported projected rise in temperatures from the MIT models, compared with the actual observed temperature trends since the previous 2003 report. Their projections show a correlation of essentially zero.Given that the observed trends are exactly opposite what the MIT models have predicted, one might have to ask what they have observed since 2003 to more than double their warming estimates, and where their 90% confidence value comes from?

The study, carried out in unprecedented detail, projected that without “rapid and massive action” temperatures worldwide will increase by as much as 7.4C (13.3F) by 2100, from levels seen in 2000.

This study has a strong scent of GIGO (garbage, in garbage out.) MIT has one of the world’s preeminent climatologists Dr. Richard Lindzen in their Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. I wonder if the scientists at the “Centre for Global Climate Change” checked with him before firing this remarkable piece off to the press?

During the Phanerozoic, CO2 levels have at times been more than 1,500% higher than present, but temperatures have never been more than 10C higher than present. So how does a projected 30% increase in CO2 produce a 7C temperature rise in their models? During the late Ordovician, there was an ice age with CO2 levels about 1000% of current levels. Hopefully the newspaper headlines don’t accurately represent the content of the article.

The United States should not have used the atomic bomb to stop the Japanese militaristic threat during World War II, seeing that it was unnecessary to cause untold suffering unto hundreds of thousands of people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Seeing that the United States is nowadays a champion of nuclear warming, it would be ironical if the nation would continue to agree with the logic of using an atomic bomb to end war. Certainly, the atomic bombs used during World War II – Little Boy (especially named for Hiroshima), and Fat Boy (detonated in Nagasaki three days after the Hiroshima bombing) – were deadly, to say the least.[1] The bombs used by the United States served to terrify the Japanese people, and therefore ended the war quicker than previously believed. However, today the United States knows that the cost that was paid by the Japanese people at the expense of a war, was humungous. It should not have happened. What if it happens in our homeland? The photographs that have arrived from Hiroshima and Nagasaki are enough to convince us that the bombing was actually unnecessary (See Appendix). If Mr. Truman were to be asked his opinion today, he might agree, although he might add that it was necessary to check the potency of those bombs for the world to stop using them altogether.

While it is a fact that the world has stopped using atomic bombs after the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombing, it remains true that it was unnecessary to use the atomic bombs in the first place. It was unnecessary because we knew all along that those bombs are powerfully dangerous. Indeed, the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings were a crime against humanity. Needless to say, it is essential to stop such crimes. Thankfully, still, the U.S. has realized its mistakes and today acts a spokesperson for ‘freedom from nuclear proliferation and explosions,’ which Mr. Truman had thought were actually equivalent to the harnessing of universal energies, if not the powers of God, as of the Big Bang. At the same time as the atomic bombing of 1945 acted as a revolution for humanity, and the marriage between technology and human beings – it was a “terrible” disaster. In the words of the then-unapologetic Mr. Truman, the extent of the disaster was also expected:

We have discovered the most terrible bomb in the history of the world. It may be the fire

destruction prophesied in the Euphrates Valley Era, after Noah and his fabulous Ark.

Anyway we “think” we have found the way to cause a disintegration of the atom. An

experiment in the New Mexico desert was startling – to put it mildly. Thirteen pounds of the

explosive caused the complete disintegration of a steel tower 60 feet high, created a crater 6

The experiment was not essential to conduct upon the lives of countless civilians who ended up losing their existence to Mr. Truman’s whim. The United States should simply have shown the New Mexico desert example to the Japanese, and warned them thereby. Science allows for such examples to serve as warnings. In any case, Mr. Truman was successful in that he managed to warn the Japanese alright.[3] As a matter of fact, the Americans promised the Japanese more ruin to come from the air, if the latter failed to concede subsequent to the Hiroshima explosion. Was it not reasonable for the U.S. to have waited more than three days before it also bombed Nagasaki – for the effects of the bomb to show up in greater intensity in Hiroshima, or for the Japanese to simply look upon their damages and surrender? The effects of the bomb were present the first day to boot.[4] Unfortunately, the Japanese did not concede until after the Nagasaki bombing.[5]

According to the Americans, by bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they terrified the Japanese into surrender. However, it can reasonably be argued that the United States should have used its actual scientific testing of the nuclear weapon (in the Mexican desert) to scare the Japanese, instead. The U.S. could have easily reported the scientific testing in the Japanese press. Furthermore, the U.S. should not have bombed Nagasaki after Hiroshima, seeing that the effects of the bomb in Hiroshima were horrible at best. The United States is a nation of people standing by God through their world-famous Declaration of Independence and Constitution. It is quite obvious from news reports about the Hiroshima bombing alone that the attack called for the help of God. In actual fact, the attack was a miserable failure for the United States because it stopped all sense of normal life in Hiroshima in the twinkling of an eye. Quite similar to 9/11, the Hiroshima bombing was enough as warning, even if we were to give the U.S. the benefit of the doubt by assuming that the scientific experiment could not have been enough of a warning for the Japanese. The U.S. should not have gone forward with the Nagasaki bombing after inflicting a disaster similar to 9/11, but bigger in magnitude than 9/11. It was an inhumane mistake.

Fortunately, however, the United States is now wise enough to avoid such disasters in the present and the future. The world knows that the nation is capable of inflicting such a disaster, and other countries are developing similar military power in a race to rule the world. All the same, everybody now understands that it is atrocious to use atomic bombs on other human beings like unto ourselves. It is not only inhumane, but also stupid to use nuclear weapons when scientific experiments (including Hiroshima) have clearly shown the immensity of the damage that these weapons may inflict. It is, moreover, a terrible mistake to be thinking of developing such weapons. Even though they serve as good warning measures, or may be later used in an ice age; atomic bombs are atrocious to employ on people. Lastly, it is essential to realize that it is never necessary to be violent and horrible. Rather, the concepts of peace, love, and brotherhood – all emotional appeals – plus numberless varieties of logical appeals could keep us on the paths of peace and prosperity. In fact, the relationship between U.S. and Japan as it exists today is evidence that the realization has hopefully occurred.

Of course, Prophet Muhammad, peace on him, never said people should be killed for abandoning Islam. Rather, the Qur’an says, “There’s no compulsion in religion.” That’s the truth. It’s another fact that illiterate so-called Muslim men invented countless sayings in the name of Muhammad.

And, what you do is to torture, oppress and kill innocent Muslims because you can’t find bin Laden and buddies, previously the buddies of Bush, etc. You imagine that all innocent Muslims are on the side of illiterate radicals. So you become as unjust as the bin Ladens.

"The Rutledge Honorary History Club celebrated its 75th anniversary
(1929-2004) at the history and political science department’s Annual
Awards Banquet on May 6, 2004. The banquet speaker was Dr. Duane Bolin,
Professor of History at Murray State University in Murray, Kentucky,
whose talk was entitled “In Search of Adolph Rupp: Fans’ Delight,
Critics’ Villain, and Historians’ Challenge.” Sixty people, including
faculty, students, alumni, and friends of the university, attended the
celebration, which was planned by the club’s president, Kari Barnhart,
and its faculty advisor, Dr. Terry Lindley.

The club’s origins date back to November, 1929, when Professor Lovick
DeWitt Rutledge and his wife, Rosa Dyer Rutledge, met with a select
group of students to discuss the possibility of a history organization.
Before November was over, the club adopted a constitution and by-laws,
and the motto: “We seek historical truth and shun historical error.” It
also adopted the following purpose: “To become better acquainted with
the field of history and to become fully conscious of the place that
knowledge of history occupies in the lives of educated people.”
Initially the club was called the Union University History Club, but it
voted to change its name to the Rutledge History Club in 1942 to honor
Mr. Rutledge, who had passed away two years earlier.

In the 1970s and 1980s the club played an integral role in promoting
and administering National History Day competitions and Annual History
Contests for high school students. More recently, it raised more than
$400 for the construction of the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.
C. It currently makes an annual financial contribution toward the awards
that the department offers to students in a history research paper
contest known as the Dr. James Alex Baggett History Research
Competition.

"Linda & Richard Eyre: A big reason for not giving up on marriage

All marriages go through their ups and downs, and we have become convinced that staying married and strengthening a marriage over time are often a matter of realizing just how high the stakes are and being committed enough that we fight our way through the tough times with never even the thought of giving up or throwing in the towel.

Staying married and strengthening a marriage over time are often a matter of realizing just how high the stakes are and being committed enough that we fight our way through the tough times.

We are continuing our focus on the topic of marriage this week because of large marriage seminars we have keynoted last week and this week and next week in Phoenix, Ogden and Minneapolis.

All marriages go through their ups and downs, and we have become convinced that staying married and strengthening a marriage over time are often a matter of realizing just how high the stakes are and being committed enough that we fight our way through the tough times with never even the thought of giving up or throwing in the towel.

And for those of us in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, particularly those with temple marriages, the stakes are almost unimaginably high. Let us try a metaphor on you that may be helpful in grasping how much is at stake and in giving us all the long-range perspective that may get us through the rough patches that every marriage experiences.

Imagine that you have started a business. Imagine that you put everything you had into the new company, all your money and all your borrowing power, and committed yourself to make that business work.

There were some good years and some bad years, but now you have had the company for some time, and in some ways you are getting a little tired of it.

And there are problems. You get audited by the IRS and have to pay some back taxes that you can’t afford. One of your employees has been embezzling from you and it is putting a strain on everything. And sometimes you feel that you don’t even really like the product you are producing and find the day-to-day process of running the business somewhat tiring and even boring.

You keep reminding yourself how much you have invested in the company — both in money and in time, and so you keep at it, slogging away and doing your best. But it just seems like things aren’t getting any easier, and more and more often you have the feeling that you should just get out — sell the company and start over. Maybe you could build a better business the next time around, one you would enjoy more and that produced a better product.

But then something happens. You have a vision one day of what the company could be worth if you held on to it and kept it going. This little epiphany overwhelms you and you fully and deeply believe that if you persevere and give it your all, the company will one day be worth not $1 million, not $100 million, not $1 billion, but $100 billion.

Now, armed not only with the motivation of all that you have put into the business, but also the motivation of the unimaginable amount that it will one day be worth, you deepen your commitment and give all you have to making it succeed.

The business, of course, is metaphorical for our marriages and for all we put into them, and for the problems and doubts and challenges we feel, and for the tendencies we sometimes have to feel like giving up or starting over with someone else, and for the inestimably huge worth that an eternal, celestial marriage will someday have.

May we all draw from both of those motivations and make our marriage commitments absolutely firm and maximize and prioritize our constant efforts to strengthen and improve this most important union of eternity.

"More British women than men think a wife's role is to 'look after her husband'

Follow the author of this article

Women in Britain think a wife’s main role is to ‘look after her husband’ a major new study has found.

The research, by YouGov, surveyed 42,000 people in 24 countries on their attitudes to gender equality. It is the first time the market reserach company has collated public opinion data on the subject.

One of the statements posed was that ‘a wife’s first role is to look after her husband’. In European countries, between seven and 18 per cent of people agreed, while in Indonesia and Malaysia more than two-thirds of the online respondents concurred.

Britain was the only country where more women (17 per cent) than men (16 per cent) agreed with the statement. It was also one of only two countries where more women believed the statement ‘a woman’s place is in the home’ (10 per cent, compared to eight per cent of men). The other was the US.

Seventy-one per cent of Brits thought ‘men should spend more time doing housework’ compared to 78 per cent of respondents in Middle East and north African nations (a group of 18 nations known as MENA and including Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria and Yemen).

Overall, the survey found a startling disparity in how the world views gender equality. In Denmark, 85 per cent agreed that men and women are of equal intelligence. In MENA nations that number was just 48 per cent.

YouGov

Nordic countries had the most gender positive attitudes, with Sweden, Denmark and Finland outperforming the other nations questioned.

Britain ranked seventh, although YouGov pointed out that “there are two attitudes in which Britain falls behind”.

These are the statements: ‘in the world as a whole women are an oppressed group’ and ‘creating more opportunity for women should be one of the world’s top concerns’. On the latter, Britain scored higher than only Morocco, Jordan, Thailand and Algeria with just 56 per cent of respondents agreeing.

Added YouGov: “While Britain has a fundamentally progressive outlook to traditional gender roles around the home and in society, the issue is not thought of as such a high priority as it is in other developed countries, either for at home or abroad”.

YouGov

Ninety-two per cent of British women thought the sexes should get equal pay, compared to 86 per cent of men. While 30 per cent though it would ‘cause problems if a woman earns more money than her husband’, compared to 18 per cent of British men.

The statement “it is unattractive for women to express opinions in public” was disagreed with by 90 per cent of British women and 86 per cent of men – but almost a third (29 per cent) of women in France concurred with the statement. This figure was roughly one in 10 throughout the rest of Europe.

In China, Indonesia and Thailand, more respondents agreed that ‘men and women are equal’ (84, 80 and 89 per cent respectively). In Britain, just 73 per cent agreed, although this can probably be explained by the differing standards of ‘equality’ in each country.

Fifty-eight per cent of those in China thought the pop singer Beyonce was a positive role model.

YouGov

Worldwide, women earn 33 per cent less than men; 700 million women are victims of physical or sexual violence every year; and men own and manage around 70 per cent of all business. Of the 774 million illiterate adults, two-thirds are women.

In Britain, the overall pay gap is around 19 per cent and two women are killed each week by a partner or former partner.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Subtone stands in the forefront of today’s young innovative Jazz ensembles. Founded in 2005 in Berlin, its members now live on both sides of the Atlantic, in St. John’s, NL, Berlin and Cologne. Through innumerable concerts at home and abroad, as well as appearances at festivals like the Bohemia Jazz Fest in the Czech Republic and Jazz Baltica in Salzau, Germany, Subtone quickly established themselves as one of the most sought-after jazz ensembles in Europe. After three acclaimed albums, in early 2014 Subtone released their 4th album “Roswitha’s Revenge” on Laika Records. Subtone is the winner of the Jury and Audience Award of the International Jazz Competition “Tremplin Jazz d’Avignon” in France.

The individual members are all accomplished performers. Collectively, they have won prestigious awards like the US National Trumpet Competition (Magnus Schriefl), the Bass Competition of the International Bass Convention (Matthias Pichler) and the Sting Ray Rising Star Award (Florian Hoefner) and have collaborated with artists and groups like the Kurt Rosenwinkel Trio, Seamus Blake, Joe Lovano, Dave Liebman, Randy Brecker and the European Jazz Orchestra.

With their own imaginative compositions, the five artists offer an inexhaustible selection, from the voluminous big-band sound to a bare-essential chamber music approach. In addition to the apparent mastery over their instruments, it is above all the implicitness with which they communicate that is so striking.

What makes Subtone stand out from other ensembles is the impressive artistic connection among the five musicians. The listener perceives this intense communication and fundamental understanding among all members of the band in the very first notes.

...it becomes obvious quickly that it’s only about the music, about the greater picture, spirit, emotions, colors, influences that have to be processed. Not a single piece follows the head-solo-head pattern which jazz musicians use as the easy way out much too often. Too much ambition is wisely being anticipated when it threatens to impede the course of events. A solo takes places when it makes sense, when the dense textures of the compositions dramaturgically call for a release.Ssirus W. PakzadNeue Musikzeitung

This band is really one of the most innovative new bands to emerge on the jazz scene over the past couple of years, with a fresh sound, great playing by all and a very positive attitude. They have a sound of their own. These guys know how to kick it and I like it! Respect!Nils Landgren

The complexity of their solely original music by far exceeds what we are used to as improvising over a theme in jazz. In fact, it does not seems like single soloists want to distinguish themselves but that all five commission their enormous technical and musical skills to a multi-layered sound painting.Münchner Merkur, Munich, Germany

It is the sound that from the first second on puts Subtone in the forefront of today’s band concepts and keeps me at it. Five marvellous soloists leave their egos outside the studio door to contribute to something higher.Till Brönner",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"ALTURAS, Calif. (AP) — Firefighters in Northern California were battling several lightning-sparked wildfires Friday, including a blaze in rural Modoc County that forced about 120 people to evacuate.

The fire near the community of Day had burned through nearly 18 square miles of brush and heavy timber and was threatening 150 structures Friday, two days after it began. It was only 10 percent contained.

Officials were expected to send additional fire crews to supplement the 700 or so firefighters battling the blaze, which is burning in steep terrain and could be aggravated by winds and lightning from more expected thunderstorms, said state fire spokesman Dennis Mathisen.

California is in its third year of drought, which has heightened the fire danger. The California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services announced Friday that it has asked the state’s National Guard to activate specially trained helicopter units to help fire agencies.

“The forward deployment of these will help incident commanders and the personnel they are directing save lives, homes and personal property as well as valuable watershed by providing critical resources within a moment’s notice,” California emergency services Director Mark Ghilarducci said in a statement.

The fire in Modoc was among more than 40 that have broken out as a result of lightning strikes since Wednesday. Most were in remote areas and were not threatening homes, and many of them were quickly contained.

In Washington state, a new wildfire burning intensely amid high winds forced the evacuation of about 200 homes Friday.

Officials ordered the evacuations and closed part of state Highway 20 because of the surging fire that started in north-central Washington halfway between Twisp and Winthrop.

The Sun Mountain Lodge, a luxury resort near Winthrop, was also evacuated as a precaution.

Janet Pearce, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Natural Resources, said some structures had burned. It wasn’t known if they were homes or other buildings.

Back in California, fire crews also were battling a blaze in Sierra National Forest about 60 miles northeast of Fresno that threatened dozens of homes and forced a handful of evacuations Friday afternoon.

Evacuations were ordered for some 50 houses in Arnold Meadows, but many are vacation homes and only about a dozen people had to evacuate when deputies went door-to-door, The Madera County Sheriff’s Department said.

The blaze was burning close to the Mammoth Pool Reservoir, a popular recreation spot that supplies drinking water, and crews were trying to finish containment lines on the section near the reservoir, said fire spokesman Matthew Chambers.

The blaze had burned through nearly 13 square miles and was 15 percent contained.

In Yosemite National Park, residents from about 50 homes returned Friday afternoon. They were the last remaining evacuees from a fire that had burned through 7 square miles and destroyed a home and a duplex. It was 78 percent contained.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Smoke-free Father’s Day

Father’s Day is the day we set aside each year to celebrate and thank dad for his many contributions. However, one thing that should not be celebrated this year or anytime, is dad’s addiction to tobacco.

A father’s influence on his children is great, and as a dad he should want to ensure that the decisions he makes are the right ones so that they do not negatively impact his children. When dad smokes, he is not only putting his life at risk, but is signaling to his family that is okay for them to follow in his footsteps.

The Wisconsin Tobacco Prevention and Poverty Network (WTPPN) is working to get the message out this Father’s Day that smoking rates among people in diverse populations are decreasing at a slower rate than the overall population. Therefore it is imperative that we as a community become aware of the tobacco industry’s savvy marketing tactics that target specific areas of Milwaukee in an effort to keep dad and his family addicted.

The love a father feels from his children on Father’s Day should be enough to make him want to quit smoking and as someone who loves their father unconditionally, we should all encourage him, if he is unable to quit on his own, to give up this deadly habit.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Web hosting options and trade-offs

Shopify and BigCommerce are two of the fastest growing and most well-known hosted eCommerce platforms. Ecommerce options exist on a spectrum of convenience and control. Both Web hosting options and trade-offs and BigCommerce are right in the middle of the spectrum because they bundle all the technical parts of an online store — hosting, speed, security, inventory, shopping cart and payment processing — and bundle it into a single monthly price.

But like a self-hosted eCommerce website web hosting options and trade-offs, Shopify and BigCommerce also bundle as part of your website on your domain where you have full control of product, pricing and customer experience. So unlike running a store on Etsy, eBay or Amazon — you control the build, design, and content of your store.

Even though this part of the spectrum has plenty of tradeoffs — services like Shopify and BigCommerce are an excellent option for many store owners. So the question becomes — Shopify vs. They are both excellent companies with an excellent product. Aside — I built a Buzzfeed style quiz for eCommerce platforms that grades the factors with your goals.

You can check out the quiz here. Also, a quick disclosure — I receive referral fees from companies mentioned on this website. All data and opinions are based on my experience as a paying customer or consultant to a paying customer. That said, their plan structure is just different enough to make a direct comparison a bit difficult. They have apps and themes — but both tend to be either free or expensive.

However, once you start factoring in apps, themes, credit card rates, and mid-tier features such as HTTPS and cart recovery — then Shopify is a better web hosting options and trade-offs value price for most stores. Either way — price is not the deciding factor for Shopify vs. Customer support is one of the most underestimated benefits of using a hosted eCommerce platform. Both BigCommerce and Shopify have customer support built into their monthly price.

You get access to all sorts of channels on both — everything from phone to chat to forums to email tickets. Shopify and BigCommerce both serve businesses that range from very small retailers selling niche products to multi-million dollar brands.

Both have enterprise plans I wrote about Shopify Plus here and they both have customer support teams trained to help absolute beginners. Their platform is built to web hosting options and trade-offs all retail businesses both on and offline. Shopify runs their own payment processing service and even has their own Point-of-Sale POS system so that small offline retailers can sell offline and online from within the same system. The idea is that your website is only one of many sales channels.

You can definitely run your website as your only sales channel in Shopify — but the options to sell elsewhere are already built-in. BigCommerce has plenty of integrations with eBay, Facebook, etc — but they are still treated as an extension of the website.

Both BigCommerce and Shopify are excellent platforms for beginners to enterprises. Both BigCommerce and Shopify have excellent onboarding processes and user-friendly management areas. Web hosting options and trade-offs main difference is how each backend is structured. BigCommerce has a single Dashboard where you manage everything — your products, inventory, website pages, settings, billing, etc.

Additionally, Shopify has their own lingo. If you have never run a website before and only have a small to mid-size product collection, then BigCommerce will likely make more sense than Shopify. Both Shopify and BigCommerce have almost all the tools marketing, SEO, inventory, order, etc an online store would need to be successful.

They differ though, in how they each approach adding new features. They have essential features that all store owners will need built-in. But for features that not all store owners need — they focus on making sure store owners can add feature extensions to their store as needed. They have a large and active App Store that not only has well-known extensions ie, MailChimp but also plenty web hosting options and trade-offs indie apps for every situation ie, apps for international tax and shipping features.

Web hosting options and trade-offs has an App Store for extensions as well. However, BigCommerce has a bigger focus on building lots of features directly into their software so that there is no need web hosting options and trade-offs add an extension.

For example, take selling on eBay or importing your eBay listings to your store. Both Shopify and BigCommerce can make these features happen. BigCommerce builds the feature into their backend. Shopify does web hosting options and trade-offs have it web hosting options and trade-offs in. Another example is bulk Redirects. BigCommerce has bulk upload built-in while Shopify users have to install an app to take care of it.

But if you do, you are more likely to get it in some form or fashion in Shopify than BigCommerce. Overall, if you have fairly core eCommerce needs and simply want everything to be there and to work — then BigCommerce will likely work better. Aside — this is why I recommend doing a 2-week free trial with both BigCommerce and Shopify just to click around and see for yourself. You select a base theme and then edit it to look as you like.

Most themes have a hybrid approach to editing. Small customizations colors, logos, etc require just a click. BigCommerce has a Theme Store that is rapidly growing. However, it still lacks the diversity of Shopify.

Their price points for premium themes are usually higher as well. So Shopify or BigCommerce — who is a better fit for who? Get a free day free trial with BigCommerce here. Get a free day free trial with Shopify here. I personally like the versatility and options of Shopify. They are likely a better fit for most online store owners.

If you are undecided — then take my eCommerce Platform Quiz here. It will take your preferences and tell you web hosting options and trade-offs is the best choice for your online store. I try to help people who run their own websites Skip to the conclusion here.

Price Ahh — price. Customer Support Customer support is one of the most underestimated benefits of using a hosted eCommerce platform. They have videos and screenshots for even small changes on the Dashboard whereas Shopify will have text instructions. BigCommerce comes across as more beginner-friendly. Shopify has more thorough and instructive content on running your overall business. They invest a lot of time and resources in case studies, long-form guides, tutorials, and helping your business succeed beyond just implementing a new feature.

Shopify web hosting options and trade-offs has a more well-developed network of 3rd party developers and marketers who specialize in Shopify. Customer Focus Shopify and BigCommerce both serve businesses that range from very small retailers selling niche products to multi-million dollar brands.

Approach to Features Both Shopify and BigCommerce have almost all the tools marketing, SEO, inventory, order, etc an online store would need to be successful. While the end result web hosting options and trade-offs the same, they do take a slightly different approach.

Ecommerce options exist on a spectrum of convenience and control. Both Shopify and Volusion are right in the middle of the spectrum because they bundle all the technical parts of an online store — hosting, speed, security, inventory, shopping cart and payment processing — and bundle it into a single monthly price.

But like a self-hosted eCommerce websiteShopify and Volusion also bundle as part of your website on your domain where you have full control of products, pricing, and customer experience.

Also, a quick disclosure — I receive referral fees from companies mentioned on this website. All data and opinions are based on my experience as a paying customer or consultant to a paying customer.

That said, their plan structure is just different enough to make a direct comparison a bit difficult. First is your monthly store fee. Both Volusion and Shopify are generally the same. Volusion is slightly cheaper, but they web hosting options and trade-offs do not include every single feature on lower tiers that Shopify does.

Second is your store transaction fee. Otherwise, their transaction fees are the same. The third is your credit card processing fees. If you use a 3rd party processor like Authorize. If you use Shopify, you can use Shopify payments for 2. If you plan on using a 3rd party processor ie, for price or for sticking with your current providerthen Volusion will be about the same — or even slightly cheaper than Shopify every month.

Either way web hosting options and trade-offs price is not the deciding factor for Shopify vs. Customer support is one of the most underestimated benefits of using a hosted eCommerce web hosting options and trade-offs.

Both Volusion and Shopify have customer support built into their monthly price. You get access to all sorts of channels on both — everything from phone web hosting options and trade-offs chat to forums web hosting options and trade-offs email tickets. In other words, Shopify has a bit more of a learning curve to learn their system, but once you learn it — you can do more with it.

Shopify and Volusion both serve businesses that range from very small retailers selling niche products to multi-million dollar brands.

Both have enterprise plans I wrote about Shopify Plus here and they both have customer support teams trained to help absolute beginners. Their platform is built to serve all retail businesses both on and offline — but with a focus on startups or online-first businesses that want to expand offline.

Shopify runs their own payment processing service and even has their own Point-of-Sale POS system so that small offline retailers can sell offline and online from within the same system. The idea is that your website is only one of many sales channels. You can definitely run your website as your only sales channel in Shopify — but the options to web hosting options and trade-offs elsewhere are already built-in.

Their backend and terminology are all focused on the store owner who has an existing retail business and needs to bring it online. They have a robust inventory system with a focus on the operations of an eCommerce store rather than the marketing of an eCommerce store. They have a straightforward functionality to bring on team members to manage listings and inventory.

Both Volusion and Shopify are excellent platforms for startups to enterprise. Web hosting options and trade-offs Volusion and Shopify have excellent onboarding processes and user-friendly management areas. The main difference is how each backend is structured. Volusion has a web hosting options and trade-offs Dashboard where you manage everything — your products, inventory, website pages, settings, billing, etc.

Volusion, though, is decidedly lacking. Again — a CMS is not in itself a huge deal. Overall, if you have fairly core eCommerce needs and simply want everything to be there and to work — then Volusion will likely work better.

Aside — this is why I recommend doing a 2-week free trial with both Volusion and Shopify just to click around and see for yourself. You select a base theme and then edit it to look as you like. Web hosting options and trade-offs can do it via drag and drop or via a hybrid approach to editing.

The main tradeoff comes from fees — And there are 3 different types of fees to consider. Customer Support Customer support is one of the most underestimated benefits of using a hosted eCommerce platform. All customer support is customized since both run on proprietary platforms.

"After exercise, the 12 healthy men participating in the study were given a cup of a sweet glucose drink and tests were done to see how quickly their bodies moved this glucose from the blood to be stored in other parts of the body, like the muscle.

Those who ate breakfast before exercise cleared glucose from their blood quickest, the team found. The researchers discovered that eating breakfast before exercising not only increased the rate at which the body burned carbohydrates during exercise, but also increased the body’s ability to digest and metabolise carbohydrates eaten throughout the day.

The study also showed the carbs burned were not only coming from breakfast, but from the glycogen stored in their muscles.

The researchers thought breakfast followed by exercise may kick start the body’s carbohydrate processing and “prime” the body for quicker storage of nutrients from the meals that follow.

While the research team is continuing to study the impact of eating before exercise, for now it’s interesting to know that eating a bowl of cereal before you work out may be a great way to kick start your metabolism for the day.

Why not try these three pre-workout breakfast ideas:

Wholegrains and milk: Just like the study why not fuel up on a wholegrain porridge made with milk, or a plant-based milk? This combination is a great source of fibre and is low GI for slow release energy. The milk or a fortified plant milk can also be a handy source of calcium and vitamin B12. As the weather warms up, overnight oats topped with fruit and a splash of milk is a tasty option too. Wholegrain cereal and milk is also a breakfast winner.

Wholegrain toast with nut butter: This is a high fibre start to the day. Nut butters are a good source of protein and healthy fats, which can lower the overall GI of a meal to keep you feeling fuller for longer. Choose a nut butter with no added sugar or salt.

Fruit smoothie: Blend up your favourite whole fruits, along with milk or plant milk. If you're not a morning person, you can prep the night before by pre-chopping your fruit so your brekkie drink is ready to blend and go in the morning.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The Outlooks
ResolutionsT
ilS is the time of year for good resolutions, but
before they can be formulated it is usually necessary
to take stock in order to see where one has failed in
the past, no less than to derive from previous successes
encouragement for further effort. At the present moment
the expansion and re-equipment of the R.A.F. is the most
vital preoccupation of the British aircraft industry. One
may, perhaps, say that it is going on as well as could be
expected, although the fact that Germany is believed to
have produced 7,000 aero engines in 1937 and to be pro-
ducing aircraft of all types at the rate of 400 per month
gives no cause for complacency. At any rate, there is
obviously nothing that can be done about it.
If one turns from military to civil aviation, there is good
cause to be alarmed. We publish in this issue an article in
which an American correspondent lifts the veil and reveals
an activity on the other side of the Atlantic which makes
our own efforts look lethargic. And last week Capt. Wil-
cockson, Imperial Airways' well-known pilot, expressed the
view that in the matter of training of personnel, operating
experience and instrument development and use, this coun-
try is three years behind the United States. Taken to-
gether, the two give one something to think about.
Losing a LeadF
ROM the point of view of technical progress, military
and civil aviation cannot be altogether segregated,
developments in one field having their immediate re-
percussions in the other, although possibly with modifica-
tions and adaptations. It is now a good many years ago
that Great Britain established a lead in flying-boat design
and construction. That lead appears to be in very great
danger of being lost, not because of inability among our
designing staffs to produce the world's best, but through
lack of support. Until Imperial Airways placed the order
for 28 Empire flying boats with Short Brothers, no British
firm had had any great encouragement to develop civil
flying boats. The Air Ministry ordered a few boats at a
time, but could not seem to make up its mind about what it
wanted, and changes in policy occurred which did not help
towards continuity of effort.
Without regarding as other than ambitious projects which
may or may not be built some day, the two American
designs for a 55O-ft.-span flying boat and a 500-passenger
one, there is sufficient actual planning, building and test-
ing going on in America to show how much in earnest are
our cousins on the other side. Glenn Martin is developing
a 100-passenger boat of 188 ft. span, intended for trans-
oceanic commercial work; his firm has already built and
flown the 157-ft-span boat for Russia described and illus-
trated in Flight recently. Martin, Boeing and Sikorsky are
building 60-tonners for the U.S. Navy, and Sikorsky is
reported, in addition, to be developing a 50-tomier for the
Atlantic service which will carry 36 passengers when oper-
ating Atlantic ranges.
Some warning that America intended to apply herself
seriously to the flying-boat problem has been evident for
some years from the fact that her research establishments
have carried out very extensive tests on hull forms. Thus,
when the Government purse-strings were loosened, Ameri-
can constructors had ready to hand a wealth of informa-
tion upon which to base, their designs. -,-..
Although it is known that Shorts have on the drawing
board an improved version of the Empire boat, and
although there are rumours of a very large machine, one
cannot quite feel that encouragement sufficient to enable
one firm to cope with the competition from three or four
American companies is being given British firms.
ExperienceI
N the meantime, as Capt. Wilcockson pointed out, the
Americans have been steadily accumulating experi-
ence in long-range transoceanic flying-boat operation.
Although weather conditions over the Pacific are very dif-
ferent from those over the Atlantic, the operation of the
Pacific route has enabled Pan-American Airways to train
their crews in long-distance navigation, and when the
Americans come to operate an Atlantic service, they will
start with a very great advantage compared with us. Navi-
gational equipment also has been greatly developed and
thoroughly tested in actual operational conditions, com-
pared with which the very limited, although very promis-
ing, experience which Imperial Airways had an opportunity
to accumulate during ten crossings of the Atlantic is insig-
nificant. Operation of the Empire routes will help to fill
the gap, but is not strictly applicable to Atlantic conditions.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The root of words like electricity, electronic, and electrostatic is the ancient Greek word elektron, meaning amber.
The Greeks used pieces of amber in jewelry. They noticed that when amber was rubbed with cloth, it attracted light objects such as hair. The amber could pick these things up off the ground,
despite the gravitational forces pulling them down. It seemed natural to attribute this behavior to the amber. Subsequently, anything that displayed similar behavior was likened to amber.
The property of amber electrostatic charging comes from triboelectric effect.

To understand the electrostatic charge, you need to think about the atoms that make up everything we can see. All matter is made up of atoms, which are themselves made up of charged particles. Atoms have a nucleus consisting of neutrons and protons. They also have a surrounding ""shell"" that is made up electrons. Typically, matter is neutrally charged, meaning that the number of electrons and protons are the same. If an atom has more electrons than protons, it is negatively charged. If it has more protons than electrons, it is positively charged.

Static charge is most often generated by contact and separation, or ""triboelectrification."" When any two materials touch and then break contact, there is an exchange of electrons; one material will be left with an excess, and the other a loss, of electrons.

Some atoms hold on to their electrons more tightly than others do. How strongly matter holds on to its electrons determines its place in the triboelectric series. If a material is more apt to give up electrons when in contact with another material, it is more positive in the triboelectric series. If a material is more apt to ""capture"" electrons when in contact with another material, it is more negative in the triboelectric series.

The triboelectric series is a list that ranks various materials according to their tendency to gain or lose electrons. It usually lists materials in order of decreasing tendency to charge positively (lose electrons), and increasing tendency to charge negatively (gain electrons). Somewhere in the middle of the list are materials that do not show strong tendency to behave either way. Note that the tendency of a material to become positive or negative after triboelectric charging has nothing to do with the level of conductivity (or ability to discharge) of the material.

The following list shows you the triboelectric series for many materials you find around the house. Positive items in the series are at the top, and negative items are at the bottom (compilation of a few
Internet sources)

Air Very
positive

Human hands (usually too moist, though)
Very positive

Leather

Rabbit Fur

Glass

Human hair

Nylon

Wool

Fur

Lead

Silk

Aluminum

Paper

Cotton Neutral

Steel Neutral

Wood

Amber

Hard rubber

Nickel, Copper

Brass, Silver

Gold, Platinum

Polyester

Styrene (Styrofoam)

Saran Wrap

Polyurethane

Polyethylene (like Scotch Tape)

Polypropylene

Vinyl (PVC)

Silicon

Teflon Very
negative

The relative position of two substances in the triboelectric series tells you how they will act when brought into contact. Glass rubbed by silk causes a charge separation because they are several positions apart in the table. The same applies for amber and wool. The farther the separation in the table, the greater the effect.

Practical conclusions

A common complaint people have on static electricity is that they shoot sparks when touching objects. This is typically caused because they have dry skin, which can become highly positive (+) in charge, especially when the clothes they wear are made of polyester material, which can become negative (-) in charge.

People that build up static charges due to dry skin are advised to wear all-cotton clothes, which is neutral. Also, moist skin reduces the collection of charges.

Neutral materials or those close to neutral are probably the best for peoples' living environment. The goal is to avoid
creation or exposure to a large electrostatic charge.

Amber Jewelry generally close to neutral

Despite the fact that it was amber that gave it's Greek name to electricity, amber is quite close to the middle of the table, relatively to the
synthetic negative materials, not much away from the neutral ones. Amber
jewelry, as compared to other materials used in living environment can be
considered slightly negative or close to neutral. Also, the active surface of
amber jewelry is small or very small and can't be meant as significant.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Your Grade

Welcome back to the TV Club coverage of Top Chef, which marks the fourth straight season covered by yours truly. I have to confess upfront that I’m feeling some trepidation at the start here: Partly because I felt the quality and chemistry of the competitors on Season Six set the bar awfully high for future seasons, partly because I found myself checking out early on the second run of Top Chef Masters: Season Two (which Emily Withrow covered), and partly because the beginning of every season offers a daunting 17 contestants, the vast majority of whom don’t stand a chance of winning the thing. That means a good 10 weeks of waiting for wheat to be separated from chaff, and trying to summon up outrage over, say, the 9th best chef getting bounced before the 13th best chef.

But while the grind of the early episodes is inevitable—aided by a reality-show formula that certainly isn’t getting any fresher—Top Chef is usually fun in its particulars and Season Seven brings us one major reason for optimism: Eric Ripert, genial culinary superstar and frequent guest in past seasons, has replaced Toby Young as the permanent fourth judge. I’m sure there must be someone who will miss Young’s canned quips and facile observations—and I’ll definitely miss the simmering contempt on Tom’s face whenever Toby opened his mouth—but I think most will agree this is an upgrade. My one concern about Ripert may be the “genial” part: Toby was not afraid to be candid, sometimes to his detriment, and it would be a shame if Ripert became the Paula Abdul of the panel, given more to gentle advise than slash-and-burn critiques. I’ll reserve judgment, but based on tonight’s debut, Ripert at least revealed some sharp, specific insights into how various dish succeeded or failed and that may be enough to compensate for his lack of tartness.

After the standard introduction atop a balcony with Congress as a backdrop, the D.C. Top Chef puts the popular mise en place Quickfire challenge front and center. Had everyone been asked to cook, we’d have gotten the usual mélange of dishes, with some overachievers underachieving and vice versa, and no real sense of who the contenders are this season. Granted, no challenge will tell us everything about how the season is going to shape up, but it stands to reason that those with refined knife skills are very likely to be refined in other areas. And lo, a pair of tough-talking, “alpha-male” types emerge as the persons to beat: Kenny, who zips through three of the four stages in first place (including breaking down four whole chickens at a rate of 10 seconds per), and Angelo, who ultimately wins the Quickfire (and $20,000) with his roasted wing & thigh, curry onion jam, and potato noodles.

Playing the role of hubristic culinary hotshot to the hilt, Angelo also emerges as the early villain of Season Seven, announcing his absurd ambition “to be the first contestant to win every single challenge” and likening his cooking to “an orchestra with flavors.” Still, I prefer brash, overconfident chefs who can cook to the brash, overconfident chefs who don’t know what they’re doing, and there’s the expected abundance of the latter early on. The Elimination challenge asks the chefs to divide into four groups and create individual dishes that most strongly represent where they’re from—all for the 300 or so partygoers (including The Bachelor from The Bachelor!) celebrating cherry blossom season. With the best and worst from each group up for victory and elimination, respectively, the two top Quickfire competitors, Angelo and Kenny, are given the advantage of choosing someone weak to square off against. Tactically, it’s only a minor edge, since nobody knows for sure how good or bad anyone else is yet; on a more personal level, it’s likely to cause friction between the Quickfire champs and the chefs they assume suck the most.

Surprise, surprise, the chefs who make head-slappingly stupid decisions are punished for it later. You had to know Jacqueline was in trouble when she talked about her desire to prove that self-taught cooks who cater can win Top Chef. Then she opted to serve a non-fat (or very low-fat) chicken liver mousse, which evinced mystified “Why bother?” looks from the judges even before they discovered she hadn’t strained the dish to cut back on the unpleasantly grainy texture. She was fortunate that bandana-donning wild man John was around to do something even dumber: Cook dessert, which has been such an Achilles’ heel for contestants in the past that Top Chef has created a spin-off show strictly for pastry maestros. I don’t care what deliciousness is oozing out of trees in Michigan: Maple mousse on puff pastry sounds sickly sweet in the best of circumstances. Add to that a pre-formed pastry—which, as Gail notes, represents a full third of his three-component dish—and John was doomed for an early exit.

As for the winners, Angelo so far makes good on his goal to win every challenge, orchestrating a bite of arctic char (with, sigh, a bacon foam) that wows the judges, and there’s Kenny again playing bridesmaid with a nicely layered trout with a cinnamon coffee rub. Kevin, who had made the final four in the Quickfire, too, acquitted himself well enough to be in contention with his lamb sous vide. Of the four, I’m thinking Alex might emerge as a wild card possibility: Tom is usually quick to hate deconstructed anything, but Alex’s dubious-sounding short rib/borscht combination allayed even his doubts. Too early to tell how the gelatinous blob that is the beginning of all Top Chef seasons will shape up, but at least there’s some heat at the top.

Stray observations:

• Because Bravo sends out the first episode of every season to critics, this review was posted right after airing. Won’t happen again. Future recaps will mostly likely be posted 90 minutes or so later.

• “Everything I do will be outstanding” —Angelo, asking for it.

• Proof that Kevin must be an excellent chef: His Jersey restaurant is called Rat’s, and it’s still in business.

• As noted in one of last season’s posts, I had the pleasure of dining at Seablue, where Stephen Hopcraft works as executive chef. (It’s one of two Michael Mina restaurants at MGM Grand.) Stephen wound up on the bottom four for his deep-fried ribeye, but I suspect he won’t reside there all season. Seablue offers a “fried” quartet of appetizers that includes a taste “lobster corn dog,” but what works for lobster apparently doesn’t for beef.

• Great tweet from Washington Post political columnist and all-around handsome bastard Ezra Klein on the irony of the Elimination challenge: “I feel like a challenge based on ""representation"" is a needlessly cruel way to start Top Chef dc. #novote”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Checklist for Fiction Readers

It can be hard to get useful feedback from friends and family. The key is to ask specific questions — questions that will get them to notice their own reactions as an ordinary reader. Honest answers to these questions will prove invaluable to any fiction writer.

1) Is there anything you didn’t understand?• Was anything confusing or hard to follow?
• Was it ever hard to figure out what was going on?
• Did anything not make sense to you?
• Were the events in the story believable?
• Were you caught up in the story? Or were there things that interrupted the flow and reminded you that you were reading a made-up story?
• Did you ever get characters confused, or forget who a character was?

2) Were you ever bored?
• Were there points where your interest flagged?
• Were there parts that felt extraneous or unnecessary?

3) Did you want to know more?
• Were there characters you wanted to know more about?
• Were you left wondering ‘what happened then?’ at any point?
• Was there anything else — setting, theme, messages — that you wish had been explored more?

4) Did the characters seem real?• Were the characters believable? (Were they ever unbelievable?)
• Did you care about the characters? (Did you ever not care?)
• Which characters did you like? Which characters did you hate? Which characters left you indifferent?

5) Did anything seem like a cliché?• Did you ever roll your eyes at a plot twist?
• Did any of the descriptions or metaphors feel tired and unoriginal?

"The backwoods-gothic terrain may be familiar, but the jolts are doled out with an expert hand in “Blue Ruin,” a lean and suspenseful genre piece that follows a bloody trail of vengeance to its cruel, absurd and logical conclusion. Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier shows impressive progress from his funny-scary 2007 debut, “Murder Party,” with this tense, stripped-down tale of a Virginia drifter who finds himself in way over his head when he tries to exact payback for his parents’ deaths.

Saulnier cleverly establishes a man-on-the-run theme in his opening shot, before the action proper has even started. Thereafter the camera practically stays glued to Dwight Evans (Macon Blair), a quiet vagrant who gets by sifting through Dumpsters and sleeping in his beat-up blue Pontiac. Yet his seemingly pointless existence is marked by curious flashes of daring and resourcefulness, if not exactly great intelligence, and he suddenly snaps into action and returns to his rural Virginia hometown upon learning that one Will Cleland has been released from prison.

Making it clear there’s a score to settle without immediately disclosing the gruesome details, the script lures the viewer into an unnerving sense of complicity as Dwight follows Will and his folks to a bar and, armed with a small knife, initiates the first of several brutal setpieces. The filmmaking is clean and efficient but the killing isn’t, and in the course of his clumsy, foolhardy getaway, Dwight ends up putting Will’s entire gun-toting redneck family on his tail. In a twist that streamlines the narrative considerably, the Clelands opt not to inform the police of the attack, choosing instead to keep things “in-house.”

While Dwight’s not-so-bright actions generate some darkly humorous beats (none grislier than when he tries, and fails, to clean a nasty arrow wound), Saulnier resists turning his protagonist into an object of outright ridicule, never compromising the audience’s intense identification with this reluctant renegade. In name and appearance, Dwight is the sort of pudgy, clean-shaven Everyman more suited to an office cubicle than a shootout, and even as the arguable aggressor in this scenario, he seems to act more out of fear and protectiveness than out of a real desire for retribution.

Blair’s engaging, soulful-eyed performance succeeds by locating the sweet spot between idiot and amateur, predator and prey. Repeatedly, Dwight plans ahead, takes calculated risks and still messes up, and much of the film’s tension derives from his very fallibility, as well as his increasing awareness that none of this can possibly end well. If the climax goes inevitably over-the-top, it’s nonetheless the sort of gruesome finish the story’s steady, merciless buildup demands.

Carefully exploiting the audience’s fear of what it can’t (or can only partially) see, Saulnier’s shallow-focus widescreen compositions amp up the suspense at key intervals, as do Julia Bloch’s crisp editing, Matt Snedecor and Dan Flosdorf’s meticulously layered sound design, and Brooke and Will Blair’s ominous synth score. While Dwight is often the camera’s sole focus, warm character notes are provided by Amy Hargreaves as Dwight’s sister, who is at once grateful for and angered by his reckless actions, and Devin Ratray as an old high-school friend whom Dwight enlists to help, in one of his smarter decisions.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

London Calling

And I...live by the river! etc.

Anyhoo, we're back in London, and on our last frantic day of shopping and meeting people before we fly out tomorrow night. Our sojourn is almost over!

The good news first is I checked my bank accounts and I got a nice whack of interest come through on one account which means I have cash! I can now buy my brother all the Von Dutch T-Shirts he's been barracking for! ;)

I will talk a bit about Budapest, considering I got cut off so quickly when I was in a net cafe over there.

We got up a 4am to leave Glasgow on a 6am flight. Greg, Debbie (his sister) and Julie (her Scottish flatmate) and I were all a bit bleary-eyed, andI was still a bit worried about my labyrinthitis. Luckily I was OK, just the normal sore head I get with airports and planes.

We flew down to London Luton, from where we caught our flight to Budapest. We had to wait a few hours at the airport, and Greg and I actually left a bag in storage so we didn't have to lug it around Budapest! At every castle we visited, Greg bought the guidebook, so consequently we have one very heavy bag!

Budapest was lovely. Quite a big city, with a population just under 2 million, about one-fifth of Hungary's overall people-count. It's very very smoggy though, with many older buildings black with pollution. Budapest was formed in 1873 when the towns of Buda and Pest, on either side of the Danube, merged to form one city. Most of the sight-seeing stuff is still on the Pest side.

The first day we climbed Mt Gillert on the Buda side. Gillert was priest made a saint for trying to convert the pagan Hungarians around 1000. They thanked him by putting him in a barrel and rolling him down the hill! Hence the hill of Gillert. It was a big climb up, but we were rewarded with good views of the city and of the Statue of Liberty on top. It's a giant bronze woman holding a palm frond. It was put up by the Soviets to celebrate their liberation of Budapest from the Nazis. After the communists left Budapest in 1991, they thought about tearing it down. But they changed their minds and left it there to now symbolise Budapest's freedom from the Soviets!

On Tuesday we headed out first to the Synagogue. Over 600 000 Hungarian Jews died during WWII, most in concentration camps. They have a memorial statue out the back of a steel willow tree, with the names of victims on the leaves. It was actually paid for by the American actor Tony Curtis, whose dad was a Hungarian Jew who died in the Holocaust.

We needed some cheering up after that, and boy did we get it. We walked along the Danube on the Pest side, past their impressive Parliament building, currently being cleaned, and across to Margaret island. It's a long island in the middle of the river. The first thing we came across were converted golf buggy-type mini cars, available to rent. It only cost about £3 each so bugger it, let's do it!

We rocketed around (well, as much as you can rocket at about 7 miles an hour) that island for an hour. It was the best fun. We've got some great bits on video, including when Debbie, Greg and I clambered into the buggy and took off, leaving a hapless Julie chasing us! It was great. I don't remember much else about the island but the buggy sure as hell will stay in my memory! My parents are actually going to Budapest in about a fortnight and I strongly suggest a buggy ride!

Tuesday we also decided to visit the baths. Budapest is famous for its hot springs, and there are numerous baths around town. It was a bit of a debacle because no one spoke English at the baths, and we were trying to rent towels and lockers with hand gestures! We also discovered we needed bathing caps to swim, so we had to buy them in the end, as it was cheaper than renting them? Bizarre.

The baths were lovely, and we felt refreshed. So we took off and grabbed the furnicular up to the castle district on the Buda side. We went into the labyrinths underneath - there are miles of caverns naturally carved through the hill by hot water thousands of years ago, and then used and maintained by locals. It was fun, because we had to take a gas lamp with us to see by - as in the evening they turn the lights off down there! They'd also put in for some reason, a fountain that flowed with wine! I think it was to signify the rich history of the early Hungarians. Or something.

Wednesday we took ourselves of on a 'Hammer and Sickle' T0ur. It was about 4 hours of communist talk. Our guide, Czaba (pronounced 'Chubba'), was really interesting. He was about 30, and had been lucky enough to visit Australia when he was 15, while Communism was still in place. It made him a bit of a rebel at school, following his father's footsteps. His father had been a sportsman so had been able to travel the world and see the cool capitalist stuff the Hungarians weren't getting. He was very against it, and it caused clashes with Czaba's grandfather, who was a very committed communist party member and local leader.

Anyhoo, we visited a communist era flat - just a sitting room, bedroom, small kitchen and bathroom, and narrow balcony. There are loads of big ugly concrete blocks still all over Budapest.

We also visited statue park, where famous soviet statues are now kept. It was funny seeing the statues with no artistic value - just propaganda!

Crap! My net time's out again...will write soon!

Hi to everyone, and sorry Clare and Briony for missing your birthdays! I'll try and pick you up something festive!

Doubling up on employees may seem like a luxury, but when the pressure’s on, you’ll be glad you did.

Excellent. It is so hard to find an actually secure bra of any kind, much less a sports bra, at this size. But this one works! I feel secure, and while it's a touch constricting, it's not nearly as bad as your average sports bra/torture device.

Some reviews indicated that this bra produces pointy result, but I took a chance and bought it. The cups and band are just right for me, lots of uplift for my age, and comfortable, the fabric is less stretchy if you prefer stretchier fabric, this bra might be too stiff for you. As to the shape of the cups, I guess I have much to fill them, so they aren't as pointy as some others said.

Was really looking forward to a sport bra in my size. But, unfortunately, this bra didn't work for me. My normal size is a 34HH, but knowing sports bras run small I ordered up a size to 34J. Was too small so I returned & ordered 34K. That was too small too. Liked the 5 hooks, & was comfortable, wish the cups had fit.

"Lung Cancer Causes You're Exposed to Everyday

If you don’t smoke, you probably don’t spend a lot of time worrying about lung cancer risks. While smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, it’s not the only one. Radiation oncologist Andrew Nish, MD, UnityPoint Health, explains the lung cancer causes you could be exposed to every day, plus the steps you can take to reduce your risk.

Lung Cancer Causes Without Smoking

Dr. Nish says about 15 percent of lung cancers in men occur in those who have never smoked and the same is true for 20 percent of women with lung cancer. Besides smoking, here are other main causes of lung cancer.

Radon exposure (second most common cause of lung cancer)

Secondhand smoke

Workplace exposure, like asbestos, diesel fumes, etc.

Air pollution, both outdoor and indoor

Chest radiation (if you’ve been treated for another cancer in the chest, such as lymphoma)

“These increase the risk of lung cancer due to exposure to an external chemical or radiation that causes damage to normal cells in the lung, which increases the risk of those cells to divide abnormally resulting in cancer,” Dr. Nish says.

Another environmental exposure in the Midwest is arsenic in ground water. Arsenic gets into the ground water and aquifers naturally from dissolving rocks. It’s recommended all private wells be tested for arsenic. Public water systems are tested and safe from arsenic.

“Almost all lung cancer is from environmental exposure with very few being from direct inheritance of a genetic mutation. Direct genetic inheritance of lung cancer risk is actually quite rare. The development of family lung cancer involves shared environmental and genetic factors among family members. Bottom line, the vast majority of lung cancers are due to environmental exposure,” Dr. Nish says.

Radon and Lung Cancer

Radon is a naturally occurring odorless, colorless radioactive gas that forms from the decay of uranium in the soil and rocks in the ground. Dr. Nish says all Midwestern states have relatively high levels of radon. For example, in Iowa, 7 out of ten homes exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) radon action level of 4 pCi/L. Iowa leads the nation as far as the percentage of homes that exceed 4pCi/L.

“Even though you may not spend a lot of time in your basement, you should be concerned about radon, as it will spread throughout your house. Radon seeps in from the ground and through cracks in the foundation, around pipes and in sump pits. Once in the house, it will spread, resulting in exposure to you and your family,” Dr. Nish says.

Testing for radon is the only way to detect radon, as there are no symptoms of radon exposure. Organizations, like the EPA and American Lung Association, recommend testing your home for radon levels. If radon levels are more than 4 pCi/L, then a mitigation system should be installed. For levels between 2 and 4 pCi/L, you should consider installing a mitigation system.

Secondhand Smoke Tied to Lung Cancer

There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke. Even brief exposure can be harmful. Secondhand smoke will start taking a toll on your body immediately.

“All secondhand smoke is equally harmful. It doesn’t make any difference whether it came from a cigarette, pipe or cigar. All sources of secondhand smoke carry the same risks,” Dr. Nish says.

Research on secondhand smoke from vaping is less certain than for tobacco, but at this time, it’s thought the chemicals released from vaping may be just as harmful as those from tobacco.

Dr. Nish also says there are greater risks associated with secondhand smoke in pregnant women and children. Exposure to secondhand smoke during pregnancy can increase the risk of miscarriage, low birth weight babies, premature birth, learning and behavioral abnormalities in the child and sudden infant death in the infant. Secondhand smoke harms older children as well.

“Children exposed to secondhand smoke have more episodes of pneumonia, bronchitis, wheezing and cough and more ear infections, plus [secondhand smoke] can worsen existing asthma and can cause new cases of asthma,” Dr. Nish says.

Top Signs of Lung Cancer

Dr. Nish says the signs and symptoms of lung cancer are the same whether you are a smoker or not. The top signs of lung cancer include:

Eat an anti-inflammatory diet. Emphasize six to nine servings of fruits and vegetables. This allows the body to more readily fix damage done to lungs, as well as protects against infections.

Learn to manage stress, and sleep more. As an adult, getting eight hours of good sleep each night is important. This and stress management help our immune systems better fight off infections and eliminate cancers before they become obvious.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The purpose of life, including our human life, is the evolution of consciousness. The aim of our human existence is to become as fully human as possible, to realise or make real the full potential inherent in the human condition. This applies to all levels of being human, to the biological, the emotional as well as the mental level.

Instead of seeing yourself as just a personality with a mind and a body, imagine yourself as part of an individualised life-stream that flows eternally towards increasingly higher levels of consciousness. This life-stream builds itself different personalities as vehicles for its flow of consciousness. You are one of these temporary vehicles. Your personality is temporary, the present cutting edge of your life-stream as perceived in our space-time.

The aim of your life-stream at this level is to develop a vehicle that allows the full expression of your soul suitable for travel beyond the human condition. When this is accomplished, no further personalities are needed. As an ascended being the life-stream can now traverse the trans-human conditions of consciousness.

SPIRITUAL AWAKENING

This evolution of consciousness normally is a slow process and most personalities are not aware that they are part of an evolutionary growth. However, as the personality comes closer to perfection, it does become aware of its purpose and it begins to long for spiritual unfoldment. Before this spiritual awakening, the personality may already have believed in God and followed a religious faith in the traditional way. But there is a difference. In the traditional religious life the believer may try to follow the doctrines of his faith the best he can, but he basically remains on the same slow evolutionary path of consciousness.

With the spiritual awakening, spiritual growth becomes the main focus of this personality. The slow evolutionary process now becomes a spiritual revolution, not only in regard to the speed of the growth of consciousness but also in regard to the overthrow of established values. This spiritual revolution may take place within the confines of an established religion or it may happen outside a religious faith. Within a religion, these awakening spirits will sooner or later come in conflict with established doctrines. They may try to revolutionise or restore their church to its highest ideals and eventually become mystics or saints or martyrs or just start their own church or sect. Most established religions had at best an uneasy relationship with their mystics and (later) saints.

In any way, whether the awakening and subsequent spiritual growth takes place within or without an established religion, the awakening personality will begin to follow the spiritual guidance that comes from within rather than the established rules and doctrines of church and society. Spirituality is no longer something that one does on Sunday mornings or other established times and according to established rules, but rather it becomes the central purpose and focus of life. With this, we may say that the personality is now on the spiritual path.

VARIETIES OF SPIRITUAL PATHS

While the real goal of the spiritual path is the same for all, there are many different roads that one can travel and one may even travel without a road. Also the goal may be described in different terms without always recognising that it is the same goal. This is so because we all have different starting points and different preferences and opportunities. Many spiritual travellers will not expect to reach their goal in their present lifetime, while others may realise that they do not really need to travel anywhere.

Some of the better-defined roads are the different forms of Yoga, the Tao, the Gnostic teachings, the Rosicrucians and various ancient and modern MysterySchools. While the Mystics are generally regarded as a distinct group, they really travelled each on his or her own individual path. At present Ascension teachings through books and channelled guidance attract many followers. These teachings are largely individualised outgrowths from the writings of the Theosophical Society since the end of the nineteenth century.

Looked at from a different perspective, we may say that there are two different approaches that often intermingle in each individual spiritual path. One is the path of the Doer or the Magus, while the other is the path of the Knower or the Mystic. The Doer mainly works in the world as a healer, alchemist or white magician, trying to master the non-physical energies and forces. The Mystic, on the other hand, follows mainly the inner path, seeking Union with the Divine Self and in the process becomes a Knower and a teacher. However, ultimately Knower and Doer both become one.

THE PATH OF THE MYSTICS

The recorded experiences of the many mystics in all religions is of particular interest because we can learn from these what the spiritual path looks like when it is not guided by specific verbal or written teachings. Most of these individuals in past centuries did not know that there was such a thing as a spiritual path and that others had travelled the same or a similar route. They just felt a longing to come closer to God and to feel at one with Him, to melt into Divinity like a drop of water becomes one with the ocean.

Each of them had different experiences and many of them walked only part of the way, but by constructing a composite picture from a large number of their writings we can discern a distinct pattern of the typical mystical path. Few mystics seem to have travelled all of this 'typical' path, but this may be because we can see only one life-time of a multiple-life-time journey. This typical mystical path may best be described as a five-stage journey and we may easily see its relationship to contemporary spiritual practises.

1. The Awakening

The spiritual awakening is the beginning of the mystical path and also of the spiritual path in general. It may be sudden or gradual. Often it comes as an emotionally overwhelming 'mystical experience', possibly ending a period of great emotional torment and suffering. Another frequent setting is during a spiritual initiation ceremony, such as presently during water baptism for 'Born-Again Christians'.

Others may have this awakening experience during an especially intense prayer or meditation or drift gradually onto the path by attending workshops or reading spiritual books. The latter as well as others coming to the path because of philosophical considerations turn out to become like the 'mental mystics' as compared to the 'emotional mystics' who had their mystical experiences mainly at the emotional level.

This initial peak experience may last for hours or days with gradually declining intensity. Commonly it is a combination of deep feelings, such as universal love, with profound spiritual intuition or insight, although depending on the personality traits the emotional or the mental component may dominate. Also psychic phenomena are frequently involved in the form of visions and voices.

2. Purification

After the awakening the individual does not only want to repeat the mystical experience but really wants to live in a permanent state of grace close to God. However, the aspiring mystic realises that he is not yet worthy, he becomes acutely aware of his imperfections, of the impurity of his thoughts and feelings. He starts to cleanse himself of all selfish or impure desires. Commonly this is combined with periods of fasting or food denial. Medieval mystics tended to be very severe with themselves in order to 'mortify' the body and with it the unruly senses and the desires of the flesh. Worldly pursuits no longer hold any interest. Periods of prayer and meditation are greatly extended.

While this process of purification requires strong willpower and causes much self-inflicted pain, it is also increasingly interspersed with beautiful and uplifting mystical experiences that spurn the seeker on to greater sacrifices for the sake of more rapturous experiences. This purification process continues for many years. Instead of turning the spiritual energies released by the awakening experience inward to purify, it may also be directed outwards. These individuals then become religious fanatics and may remain at this level for the rest of their lives.

3. Illumination

After the Self has been sufficiently cleansed or purified and the mind remains fully focused on the presence and the qualities of the Divine, a state of illumination may unexpectedly arise. This will be similar to the experience of awakening but even more intense and longer lasting. Again, it may be predominantly emotional with feelings of indescribable Divine love, being at one with 'All That Is' and combined with visions and voices, or it may be predominantly mental with profound insights and states of pure knowing. Commonly the initial peak experience is combined with perceiving an intense or blinding inner white light.

For many months these deep feelings and insights will keep flowing in, but gradually settle into a state of a permanently raised and more intuitive consciousness. The illuminated mystic will now always remain aware of the Divine presence in everyone and everything and radiate a presence of love and goodwill. Intuitive abilities will be greatly increased. Commonly, one will receive a spiritual gift with the illumination. This may be the ability to heal or to see or to know. By developing this ability one will become a great healer, seer or spiritual teacher.

The perception of mysticism as being incomprehensible to normal, unenlightened humans is due to the fact that most mystical writings were composed by the emotional type of mystics. They focused on emotional states of being and perceived and described their visions and experiences with emotional metaphors that remained incomprehensible to the uninitiated. This is similar to the present descriptions of reality given by quantum physicists.

Life in this state of illumination is easy and full of joy, a permanent state of great happiness and contentment. It is like living in a state of grace that can never be lost again. But sometimes it is being lost.

4. The Dark Night of the Soul

There is a saying that he whom God loves most, will be given the severest tests. This certainly seems to be true of the few mystics who continue to travel further along the spiritual path even after illumination. During the long and difficult purification process the aspiring mystic gave up most of his sense attachments, the pleasure of eating, of sexual union, of bodily comfort and of pleasant company. Instead all the energies were focused only on what was perceived to be transcendental and divine.

But there was still one thing left that had not been surrendered, that is the will, the central part of the Self. To give up the will, the innate instinct for personal happiness had to be surrendered. This is called the 'mystical death' or the spiritual crucifixion. During illumination the mystic seemed to walk hand in hand with God and sunned himself in eternal Divine bliss. This makes the contrast even greater to the feeling of having lost all the former grace and glory and being totally abandoned by God to a life in abject misery.

However, gradually the Self begins to accept total surrender. It gives up itself, its personality and individuality, asks for nothing and desires nothing. Now there is total passivity and acceptance of whatever God has ordained or whatever comes. Now the mystic is finally ready for the last stage of his earthly journey.

5. The Unitive Life

Finally, by giving up everything, the mystic has gained everything. By being completely passive, he is able to be filled with the Divine Spirit. No longer does he experience the strong mood swings between divine bliss and utter desolation, he has now settled into a feeling of constant peaceful and love-filled union with the Divine. However, this is not the goal of his long journey, just a by-product. The real achievement is that the mystic is now an ideal tool or instrument of the Divine Will to be used for manifesting the Great Plan on earth.

While now the mystic still lives in the world, he is no longer of the world. He may be a great reformer, healer, inventor, statesman, educator or spiritual teacher but whatever he does is never for any small or selfish interests, instead it is always for the greater good of All That Is. He now lives a life of service. Whatever he does, he is now a spiritual master, even if that is not always apparent to the outside world. After his passing, he will be an ascended being, not needing to return to earth.

Comments on the Mystical Path

In this description it is easy to draw comparisons to the life of Jesus of Nazareth and see in it a symbolic enactment of the mystical path. The baptism symbolises the spiritual awakening, the 40 days in the desert correspond to the period of purification, followed by illumination (the transfiguration on the mountain) and selfless service in the form of a healing and teaching ministry. The experience on the cross and the events leading up to it are his dark night. While the unitive life is cut short, it is signified by the ascension and the following teaching period in ascended form.

It may also be mentioned that the described states of the mystical path do not necessarily follow one after the other but some may occur simultaneously, such as enlightenment and the dark night of the soul or purification, enlightenment and selfless work. These may coexist or alternate, causing emotional extremes over short periods. Coexistence is possible because we do not need to be perfect to reach illumination and, therefore, continue with our purification on deeper levels.

Furthermore, these extremes and the perceived sufferings are mainly the lot of the emotional type of mystics while the mental type follows a much smoother path. Both have the difficult task of giving up their attachments to gratifying the senses and surrendering their will, it is just that the emotional mystics are so much more sensitive and take things very much to heart. It also must be understood that it is not necessary to give up things, only the attachment to things but that was not always understood by those leading a life of extreme asceticism.

ASCENSION TEACHINGS

The ascension teachings are a New Age phenomenon and largely based on channelled teachings. These started with Madame Blavatsky and led to the foundation of the Theosophical Society late in the nineteenth century. The aim of these teachings is to present a greatly accelerated path to ascension.

Ascension is highlighted as the main aim and achievement of the spiritual path. Ascension means that we are no longer in need of experiences at the human level. For our continuing progress towards higher levels of consciousness we develop a spiritual light body through our ascension work. Presently ascension teachings focus mainly on guided imagery to open, balance and extend the chakra system and build a light body.

A key feature is a system of initiations as a measure of progress on the spiritual path. These initiations are to take place in our higher energy bodies and may or may not be remembered with our normal body consciousness. While there are some variations in the way of counting, the basic requirements for passing the five initiations before ascension may be described as follows.

Spiritual Awakening.

Purifying the body, learning to work with the energies and controlling the etheric body.

Purifying and controlling the emotions as well as developing a higher emotional body.

Purifying and controlling the mind as well as developing a higher mental body.

Submitting the will to Divine Guidance.

Selfless work for the greater good of humanity.

Ascension.

While formerly initiations in the physical body took place in the form of tests and rituals within secret societies, presently they appear to be incorporated as special situations in our normal life. As an example the third initiation requires us to have good control of the mental, emotional and etheric forces. In ancient Egypt an appropriate test might have been for the disciple to demonstrate that he can control an untamed lion with his mind and the lion obeying him. At the slightest sign of fear the lion would kill him.

A modern equivalent might be a diagnosis of advanced and incurable cancer. To overcome this without much outside help, one needs to use the mind constructively to guide the emotions in a positive way, release all negativity, especially be free of the fear of death and also learn to direct the life-force energies as in guided imagery. While only a small percentage of sufferers of advanced incurable diseases may have been given their disease as an initiation test, most of those who did recover from near-terminal conditions reportedly had profound spiritual experiences.

The relationship of the ascension initiations as portrayed above to the divisions of the mystical path are quite obvious. Starting with the spiritual awakening in both, the first three initiations are related to the mystical period of purification. In contrast to the yoga system of purification, which concentrates strongly on controlling the etheric energies, the mystical path does not address the etheric or life-force body directly. However, this level is purified indirectly by removing emotional energy blockages and by learning to control the emotional energies, which in turn direct the etheric life-force energies.

Illumination is the first major initiation and is the result of purifying and learning to control the mind and developing a higher mental body as the requirement for the third initiation. The fourth initiation will be passed after waking from the dark night of the soul and the fifth initiation is the result of the unitive life.

The ascension teachings portray largely a magical or doer path in contrast to the knower-based mystical path. A combination of both may in some ways be easier to follow than either one of them on its own. The severity of the mystical path can be greatly eased and progress speeded up by suitable guided imagery, while the present ascension teachings seem to neglect the purification and control of the emotional and mental bodies that feature so prominently in the mystical path.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Here's a few I shot over the past 6 months - all photos shot in the wild - no zoo or otherwise with 7D + 400mm hand held:

Belted Kingfisher (difficult to capture..you get anywhere near these birds they fly about 100 yards away. You go that direction they revert back to original starting point. I had to creep up and hide to nab this one..oh the fun!

I took the following at Great Falls National Park, Virginia side. A lot of stalking went into taking these photos. I found this really awesome spot that gave me all 3 of these pictures and more. Shot with canon 5D II and 100-400 L.

I wish I knew why a sparrow will sit on a bird feeder for half an hour, but a cardinal won't stay more than half a minute.

When I saw him, he and his female mate were both right there perfectly positioned. While I grabbed the camera and changed lenses, Mrs. Cardinal took off. This was the only shot I got with the whole bird in the frame and in focus.

"This 1993 Nissan Skyline R33 GTS25-T Type M has just arrived to our showroom and looks absolutely beautiful. The Super Black (KH3) exterior has been lightly modified and is has been very well maintained. A super rare Trial front bumper replaces the OEM piece and helps create a more aggressive looking front end. The OEM Type M optional Side Skirts are present and flow well with the Trial front bumper and Knight Racer rear spats which are a bit more aggressive than the stock pieces. The body is in beautiful condition with no major dings or dents and the paint is just stunning. The GTR rear wing really improves the rear of the car and continues the slightly more aggressive feel of this beautiful R33. Finally a set of 18"" Monoblock wheels have been added and contrast the black exterior perfectly.

The interior has also received several upgrades and is in great condition. You will first notice a set set of gauges have been added to keep an eye on engine stats. These include Boost, Oil Pressure, Coolant Temp, and Oil Temp by Auto Gauge. The dash itself is in great condition and has no major sun damage, cracks, or bubbles. An aftermarket steering wheel has been added along with a Razo shift knob. The door panels are very clean and the fabric inserts are in great shape. There is on small tear on the lower right part of the drivers door panel which in not noticeable when the door is closed. The seats are all in fantastic condition and have no major stains. The trunk panels have been previously removed, but the OEM strut bar and OEM floor mats are included.

Mechanically the RB25DET starts right away and idles smoothly. Exhaust tone has been much improved thanks to a stainless Reinhard Takumi Catback, and a M's air intake lets the engine breathe a bit easier. Shifts through the 5 speed transmission are smooth without any grinds. It's clear the engine is healthy with just 114k original miles. Boost comes on strong and pulls hard throughout the RPM range and sounds great doing it!

Last year was our biggest ever and with a slight uptick in the economy since last season, I am hoping for some really great things. In a down economy entertainment always prospers... I think it will be an outstanding season.

To be more specific, I expect to see the same trend from last year, those major market haunts who have already peaked in their markets should hold their own and those us in expanding markets or who haven't maxed out our markets should see some nice growth.

Last year we broke the paid attendance record from the previous year in the last hour. Despite the fact that I didn't finish a ton of marketing because of our twin girls being born eleven weeks early on Sept 11. They are doing great by the way.

I am already doing some marketing on myspace and facebook. We have gone from 400 to 2000 friends on myspace and have the FB fan page just starting to build.

We are half way through our changes for the year and have a huge increase for the 2010 goal.

Indiana unemployment is at 10% but the economy is picking up in the area. The GM plant I work at just added 900 workers for a third shift of production and the real estate market is jumping. People are starting to spend money again!!!

Ernst Conservation Seeds grows, processes and sells over 400 species of native and naturalized seeds and live plant materials for restoration, beautification, reclamation and conservation. The environmental climate and professionals in the field are recognizing how important natives are in the restoration of our North American ecology, and that natives are the best choice for use in almost every scenario. We know how to harvest native seeds and grow them in a production environment. We know how to help our customers replicate that success in their own applications. This steadfast commitment to understanding our customers’ needs and advising them on the best solutions hasn’t changed in fifty years.

Company details

Ernst Conservation Seeds was founded by Calvin Ernst in 1964 as Ernst Crownvetch Farms. This third generation family-owned and operated business was formed to meet the need for soil conservation along our interstate highways. Since that time, our business has evolved with the needs of the soil and water conservation industry. Driving this evolution are increased public and governmental interest in native species as a preferred first choice, sustainable landscape design, low-impact development, responsible reclamation and restoration, improved biodiversity, habitat development and evolving practices in conservation agriculture. Today, we grow, process and sell over 400 species of native and naturalized seeds and live plant materials propagated on more than 8,000 total acres. While the majority of acreage is located in northwestern Pennsylvania, we own additional farm land in Florida, and have cooperative relationships in Maryland, North Carolina and Oregon. Our products are sold to conservation organizations, landscape architects, reclamation/restoration contractors, government agencies and private landowners throughout the United States and abroad. We pay special attention to providing species that enhance the beauty of the environment by their colorful flowers, fruit and foliage. We go to great lengths to provide native seed mixes that reflect the wide variety of species that we have studied growing together in native environments. We provide a diversified selection of seeds and materials that are sure to be of the highest quality. Every order is harvested, processed and shipped with pride and dedication from our entire family and staff. The individual needs of our customers remain our highest priority. We are dedicated to providing our customers with the best native and naturalized seeds and materials available. Our family and employees are dedicated to providing you with products that reflect our values. We trust that each order will be filled to your satisfaction. “The environmental climate and professionals in the field are recognizing how important natives are in the restoration of our North American ecology, and that natives are the best choice for use in almost every scenario,” says Calvin. “We know how to harvest these seeds and grow them in a production environment. We know how to help our customers repeat that success in their own applications, and we take the time to do that with each customer.”

Many of the most successful enterprises in history owe their staying power to a visionary leader – one who guided them through the best and worst of times – always with a steadfast resolve and unwavering vision for their destiny. The history of Ernst Conservation Seeds is one such story – intertwined uniquely with that of its founder and president, Calvin Ernst.

Born and raised a stone’s throw from where his sprawling agribusiness calls home, Calvin proved himself to be a savvy entrepreneur by the young age of 14, when he received his Pennsylvania nursery license, now known as a plant merchant certification. In his senior year of high school, Calvin grew the record corn crop in Crawford County with guidance from his 4-H leader and the local Penn State University Cooperative Extension office.

As a junior at Penn State in 1962, Calvin, his brother Luther and some friends were performing research on crownvetch — an herbaceous legume that spreads through both rhizomes and seed — for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Some staff members from the University told the young men they couldn’t find anyone interested in growing crownvetch.

Calvin recalls, “I didn’t initially think that seeds would be my thing. It was really the challenge of doing something PennDOT couldn’t get anyone else to do that put me on this path.” And Calvin has always loved a challenge.

In 1963, Calvin was working for Penn State’s College of Agriculture and Luther as a school administrator. The brothers scraped together $1,000 to purchase foundation crownvetch seed and convinced their father, Ted, to plant it on five acres of the family farm. The gamble, they assured him, would pay off.Recalling his mother’s reaction to the initial seed purchase, Calvin says, “She thought every seed must have been worth a penny – she even swept the stray seeds off the barn floor.”

It was also in 1963 that Calvin made his most auspicious proposal — and realized his greatest personal gain — when he requested, and was granted, the hand of Marcia Atwell in marriage. The two have been life and business partners ever since, literally traveling around the globe and making an indelible mark on the seed trade industry in the ensuing 50-plus years together.

Reflecting on the importance of having her by his side all these years, Calvin says, “Marcia has always supported me personally and professionally. And I could count on her, as I could my parents, to question me on why I thought something was the right idea. She would never say, ‘Don’t ever do that again,’ but instead she would ask why things didn’t work out and how we could learn from it.” He continues, “I think more than anything, it was her support back home and keeping the family together and strong that always made it productive for me to go out and try things, then come back and regroup now and again.”

In 1964, the Ernst brothers planted an additional 60 acres of crownvetch on leased land in the spring, and harvested the earlier five-acre stand that fall. With Ted’s assistance, the 1964 crop was sold to Stanford Seed in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania. The Ernst family enterprise — newly dubbed Ernst Crownvetch Farms — had its first customers and was officially in the seed business. The sale to Stanford Seed and other early customers allowed the fledgling agribusiness to hire its first full-time employee, who would help them expand production on owned and leased land.

Calvin had witnessed firsthand the potential of crownvetch for erosion control while living and working in the greenhouses at Penn State. His gut told him this legume held enormous potential for commercial viability. His timing couldn’t have been better. It was during this period of time in the mid-to-late 1960s that the massive Unites States Interstate Highway System was being built. Superhighways like I-79, I-80, I-90 and I-95 were being carved across the American landscape. Suddenly, there was high demand for effective cover crops to revegetate rights-of-way and highway medians. Much of Ernst Crownvetch Farms’ key growth occurred during the ensuing years, thanks largely to the relationships being cultivated with highway departments and government agencies involved with the interstate system.

The 1967 crownvetch crop made it possible to purchase the 180-acre property which Ernst Conservation Seeds still calls home today. It also allowed for the Company’s first personnel expansion, to what was then a handful of people who helped the Ernsts grow both crownvetch seed and crowns.

In fall of 1969, Ernst Crownvetch Farms joined forces with Multi-Systems, Inc., a public corporation based in Detroit, to purchase a 640-acre farm in north central Nebraska, where they plowed under the native prairie and planted the entire farm in irrigated crownvetch. The purchase doubled the acreage Ernst had in production at the time. Over the next three years, Calvin, Marcia and young sons Andy and Michael would spend a couple months each spring and fall living on the Nebraska farm while fields were planted and harvested.

By 1972, the price of crownvetch collapsed. The Ernsts’ partnership with Multi-Systems was mutually severed, with Ernst Crownvetch Farms owing $12,000. With no available assets, Calvin and Marcia took yet another risk by securing local Farmers Home Administration financing on approximately 500 acres back home in Crawford County. The couple expanded their business by growing crownvetch crowns and potted plants. They soon paid their debt from the dissolved partnership and moved on, in control of their own destiny once again.

The couple was blessed with the birth of daughter Robin in 1973. The remainder of the 1970s saw Calvin and Marcia raising the three kids while continuing to sell crownvetch and grain crops. According to Calvin, the children all shared a love for the natural world and the ever-changing business their parents were in.

“I don’t think they ever looked at our farming as drudgery,” he says. “It seems they always figured, ‘Something’s going to happen here that’s going to be more exciting than the last thing.’ And that kept them engaged. Every time we made progress, we shared it with them as well. I think that was important. And it’s something they do with their own kids today.”

The business continued to expand until the 22% interest rates of the early 1980s hit. When the value of crownvetch wasn’t worth the cost of harvesting it, the couple began growing large volumes of no-till corn planted right into the existing crownvetch fields. The practice created high corn yields due to the legume’s excellent nitrogen-fixing properties. Once again, crownvetch had saved the day, even when it was playing a supporting role as a cover crop.

In 1985, Ernst Crownvetch Farms hired its first full-time information technology employee to manage the company’s inventory and sales & marketing activities. This progressive move was becoming characteristic of the Ernsts and their approach to agriculture as a true business, and its employees as professionals.

“I think I’ve generally been successful at finding or developing a skill set within an employee – a skill set that was useful for the business and that person’s professional growth,” he comments. “I’ve tried to mold some of our employees into what the business needs them to be with a lot of success. And some of them I’m still working on,” he laughs.

In the later 1980s, Ernst began growing native deertongue obtained from the USDA’s Big Flats Plant Materials Center in Corning, New York. Deertongue was the first native used for strip mine reclamation where low soil pH was a challenge. Calvin credits the propagation and marketing of deertongue seed as the turning point in the Company’s eventual transition from the non-native crownvetch that had driven sales for the first 20-plus years to the native plant species that would assume that role moving forward. The Company planted its first foundation switchgrass seed (‘Shelter’ variety) in 1988. Calvin was interested in switchgrass because it added wildlife value to strip mine and reclamation seed mixes. It wouldn’t take long, however, for him to find an even higher calling for this high-yielding warm season grass that grows so well on marginal lands.

In 1990, Ernst was purchasing much of its crownvetch seed from growers in southeastern Minnesota in order to mitigate the effects of low market prices. The Company built a small processing facility and erected a handful of grain bins there. Calvin recalls that these activities in Minnesota first piqued his interest and drove a shift in his business strategy toward the diversity of natives and their potential to revolutionize the seed trade. Southeast Minnesota and Iowa were home to many of the first commercial growers of native ecotypes. This fraternity of like-minded producers was very helpful, sharing their combined insights with the ever-curious and innovative entrepreneur. In short order, Calvin began shifting acreage from grain and crownvetch production to that of native forbs and grasses.

In step with Ernst’s shift toward native ecotypes was a shift in the attitudes of government agencies toward the use of non-native species such as crownvetch. Non-natives, specifically those classified as aggressive species, were beginning to be blacklisted in favor of a move toward native species. Once again, Calvin had begun innovating and adapting his product offering ahead of the curve.

Calvin has always believed in the need to continually educate himself and others on best practices, to study the future of agronomy and foresee opportunities to diversify and meet future demands. His peers recognize this as well, often inviting him to speak or to participate in the greater conversation within the industry. In the summer of 1990, Calvin and Marcia traveled to Eastern Europe as part of the “People to People” exchange program in order to study a diverse agricultural practice. In 1991, Calvin traveled with the USDA to China to promote inter-cropping perennial legumes with annual grain crops in order to reduce crop inputs and erosion.

Further expansion of the farm’s operations occurred at this time with help from Ted and the hiring of additional employees.

Calvin recalls fondly one of those employees in particular.

“Pressley Hilliard came to me in an old wreck of a car one day and said, ‘Calvin, you need to buy my farm and grow corn.’ I said, “Pressley, I’m going to show you how to make money without growing corn or raising dairy cows.” We spent time traveling together in the Midwest buying and selling seed and he became enamored with the large production fields. You see, fifteen years ago or so, there was a big transition from dairy farms to crop farms. And it seemed that on every farm where they had torn down the old dairy barns and went straight to crop farming, there was a Cadillac in the yard, so to speak. And on one of those trips, Pressley finally looked at me and said, ‘when I get back, I’m gonna tear down those old barns.’ He was a great person and really became member of our family. We lost Pressley a couple years ago, and folks are still telling stories about him today.”

In 1993, Ernst Crownvetch Farms secured the rights to grow and market ‘Niagara’ Big Bluestem, which was successfully planted in 1994. At about this time, the Company changed its name to Ernst Conservation Seeds in order to better represent its evolving products and philosophy. By that time, Ernst was wild harvesting and growing native wetland seeds for the wetland mitigation market.Further opportunity arose when Ernst began collaborating with federal agencies, highway departments and land developers for the purpose of establishing wetlands and meadows using native seeds, and teaching these groups how to install bioengineering materials for soil stabilization.

Andy, Michael and Robin all pitched in with Ernst employees to expand native seed production and sales. Andy became involved in both state and national professional seed organizations that promote better quality standards. Michael busied himself building additional processing, storage and office capacity. Robin directed seed sales and promoted efficient native seed installation.Mark Fiely joined Ernst Conservation Seeds in 1995 as its full-time horticulturist, helping Calvin diversify the Company’s offering of native ecotypes. To this day, Mark spends a considerable portion of his time traveling the eastern United States in search of new species and researching their viability as production crops. He also works closely with customers, from large government agencies to landscape architects and hobby gardeners, all with the goal of educating them on the use of native species and assisting in their successful establishment.

In 2001, fire destroyed a major portion of the Company’s seed conditioning facility in Meadville and several of that year’s crops were lost. Employees and neighbors brought their own tools to help the family rebuild.

“Our community was showing up to help us before the end of the first day,” recalls Calvin.

With used equipment and loyal employees, seed was conditioned outside through the winter. In 2002, a new seed processing facility was completed, including equipment repair bays and a secure bay for the handling of field spray applications. Though the incident was tragic, it is widely seen as a unifying moment in the history of the Company, strengthening bonds between the family, its employees and the community, while also necessitating facility expansion and improvements that would pay dividends in short order.

“It was something we’d never want to repeat under the same circumstances,” Calvin reflects. “But it allowed us to rebuild and improve the facilities we had. The changes we were able to make to our capacity and processing efficiency just advanced us tremendously. And the way our neighbors, business partners and employees came together and helped out so quickly is very special. It was quite a pulling together.”

In response to a challenge to develop a native seed source for the extreme southeastern United States, Calvin initially utilized his vacuum harvesting technology to wild harvest wiregrass in central Florida. These successful wild harvests and collections of native forbs and grasses throughout Florida gave him yet another opportunity to expand. In 2003, the Ernst family purchased a farm in Live Oak, named it Ernst Southern Native Seeds, LLC, and began field production, with frequent assistance from the NRCS Plant Materials Center (PMC) in Brooksville, Florida and the Florida Wildflower Seed & Plant Growers Association.

Due to decreased demand, coupled with production difficulties involving wiregrass and some of the forbs, this venture did not prove to be as fruitful as hoped. However, with the aid of the Brooksville PMC, Calvin is successfully producing seed of two plant materials center releases of ‘Stuart’ and ‘Miami’ switchgrass. Additionally, in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (USDA, ARS) in Griffin, Georgia, he is multiplying seed for more than 40 southeast ecotypes of lowland and upland switchgrass, along with his own native wildflowers. Calvin had been considering the potential for developing grass biomass for energy production. He put his plans to the test in 2005 by leasing 5,000 acres of marginal farmland in Crawford County and planting switchgrass for seed and biomass production. With marginal land being what it is, Calvin learned plenty about the effects of low pH and wet soils. Switchgrass performed well, but, “with thousands of tons of lime and patience, it did better,” recalls Calvin with a wry grin.

Research soon began on the densification of grass for use in direct combustion applications. In a characteristically gutsy move, Calvin decided that his Company would need to be the innovator once again — leading the charge instead of sitting on the sidelines of progress. Ernst would build its own state-of-the-art facility to process warm season grasses. Michael and a select group of dedicated employees designed and constructed a pellet plant that uses only grass. The plant was completed in 2012 and is currently producing densified grass pellets for multiple uses as a separate entity called Ernst Biomass, LLC.

As with most of Calvin’s ventures, very little financial assistance was utilized in the interest of maintaining project control and keeping development on schedule. The facility has opened numerous market opportunities for grass biomass, including numerous agricultural applications and uses in the burgeoning Utica and Marcellus shale oil and gas plays of the northeastern United States.

Today, with over 8,000 acres in production, Ernst grows more than 400 diverse crops for conservation, restoration, beautification, energy, pharmaceuticals and consumption. Future growth opportunities can be seen in increased public and governmental interest in sustainable landscapes, low-impact development, responsible reclamation and restoration, improved biodiversity and habitat development, and evolving practices in conservation agriculture.

While Calvin and Marcia show no sign of slowing down, their children all play critical roles in the future growth and diversification of Ernst Conservation Seeds and its affiliates. Andy and Michael Ernst share responsibilities for day-to-day operations at Ernst Conservation Seeds and Ernst Biomass, while Robin operates Meadville Land Service, Inc., a full service mobile restoration company specializing in the construction, restoration and mitigation of streams and wetlands, as well as native planting, seeding and the installation of bioengineering material. Darrell Ernst, Calvin’s younger brother, has been with the Company as an electrical and hydraulic mechanic for over five years.

After a passing glance back on the first 50 years of his Company’s history, Calvin immediately focuses on the promise of its future.

“The environmental climate and professionals in the field are recognizing how important natives are in the whole restoration of our North American ecology, and that natives are the best choice for use in just about every scenario.

“Through our experience, we know how to harvest these seeds and grow them in a production environment. We know how to help our customers repeat that success in their own unique applications, and we take the time to do that with each customer.

“There’s progress to be made in the efficiency of producing native seeds and in discovering, or creating, new markets for them. We continue to find new plants in diverse ecologies that may contain a thousand species in a square mile.

It is the mission of Ernst Conservation Seeds to make available to eastern North America the key native and naturalized species of plants for restoration, reclamation, conservation, wildlife and pollinator habitat enhancement, renewable biomass energy and the beautification of our nation.

We will identify, collect and propagate new species and ecotypes that will meet our clients’ needs, from eastern Canada to the southeastern United States. Our native seeds are produced from species that are considered the most significant foundation of an effective native restoration or reclamation project. To ensure our customers receive a quality product, all of our seeds are harvested, conditioned and tested under the highest quality standards.

In addition to 8,000 acres of native seed production at Ernst, we supply seed from some of North America’s top producers and collectors. Ernst Conservation Seeds and its suppliers collect, grow and process all of our products in an ecologically sustainable and renewable manner.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Don't get me wrong,
Macross is a great Anime series. But, the

"How to Control the Ring

In this week’s CROM’s Corner we will be going through part 2 of our Footwork series.

Although there are a few different aspects that go into Ring Generalship, I believe the integral components stem from footwork. Some people understand the term, some people have never heard of it, and some don’t care for it. If you are any of these three, know that if you don’t KO/stop your opposition that this is one of the deciding factors that a judge will be looking at to score for or against you.

While it’s true that everyone loves a knockdown, drag ‘em out brawl, I was a commentator on a beautifully technical bout this past weekend which was a great display of exactly what ring generalship represents. It was a 5 round work of art by two female Nak Muays in a rematch at the 105 lb/ 48 kg mini flyweight division. The blue corner was the taller and more aggressive style fighter, as the red corner was content to be the counter fighter.

From the opening bell the blue corner was attempting to set the pace by using her lead leg to establish range. The red corner was wise enough to stay just out of range and counter with hopping lead leg push kicks of her own. As the fight/round went on the red corner started to evade and counter the blue corners attack using precise timing and low kicks to blue corner’s lead leg. Though the blue corner was using smart aggressiveness the red corner was utilizing sharp footwork to stay out of corners, off the ropes, and to create angles for her low kick attacks. The red corner was able to use position and ring awareness alongside accurate counter attacks throughout the fight to retain her title in championship form.

How do you define “Ring Generalship”?

I believe every coach will have their own interpretation as to what ring generalship is and they will have valid points. In my opinion, ring generalship is the ability to move and use the entire ring in such a way to corral and land significant strikes to mentally and physically dominate your opposition.

The finer points of Ring Generalship:
-Precise and purposeful footwork
-Awareness of where you are in the ring in relation to your opposition
-Being able to use the ropes to your advantage
-Using feints to keep your opponent guessing, confused and off rhythm
-Using stalling or retreating to bait the opposition in to attacking first, leaving them open for counter attacks
-Mimicking a shark with circling and forward movement as you are hunting and stalking for your own offensive maneuvers

As with any technique in Muay Thai do your best to incorporate this in to your shadowboxing, bag work, pad work and sparring and it will become a part of your fighting strategy. Becoming a ring general will make it crystal clear for the judges and the crowd to see who’s in charge.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Professional Presence
The Hard Facts about
Soft Skills
Handouts

2.
In business, professional relationships are enhanced when people understand and
practice business protocol. Every time an associate presents or accepts a business
card, greets a customer with a handshake, or attends a business lunch or dinner, they
will exemplify the polish and professionalism that communicates exceptional customer
service and market leadership. In today’s more casual business dealings, that rare
individual is easily distinguished from the competition. Business protocol and etiquette
is also a foundation for individuals developing their leadership potential. It makes an
immediate and noticeable difference in how an individual is perceived and in their
effectiveness in business and social interaction.

What is Business Presence?
A powerful business presence exudes high-level professionalism in attire, posture,
conduct, and verbal skills as well as displaying confidence, leadership, and personal
power in a businesslike manner. A powerful business presence conveys on the nonverbal
level: ""I am intelligent; I have choices; I am resourceful; I can be authoritative, easily
managing and inspiring other people; and I am capable of handling any business
situation, including conflict and curve balls.""
Know the components of business presence, and learn how to use them to your
advantage:
• Attire - all aspects of your clothing selections, including accessories such as
shoes, jewelry, eye-glasses, etc.
• Hair - style, color, condition, length
• Grooming - overall cleanliness, and personal presentation, including fragrances
use and abuse
• Posture - confidence in the way you hold yourself
• Demeanor - mannerisms, and body language
• Business Accessories -such as briefcases, pens, technology tools, etc.
• Communication Skills - articulation, eye contact, and effective listening
• Etiquette Skills - the right handshake, business protocols, and courtesies

First Impressions
Appearance + Actions + Attitude
When someone meets you for the first time, they will make up to eleven
assumptions about your personal or professional life. These assumptions are
made fast – within three to seven seconds. Right or wrong, correct or incorrect,
your appearance, actions, and attitude prompt immediate speculation –
conclusions accepted as true without any real proof.
Age ~ This assumption is largely based on physical aspects. Make sure you pay
attention to your appearance.
Level of Education ~ Education can refer to textbook knowledge as well as
worldly exposure. Appearance, action & attitude – will strongly affect this
assumption.
Moral Character ~ This assumption is based on whether you project an
understanding of what is morally and socially right or wrong.
Likability ~ Your actions, particularly nonverbal body language, can greatly
affect this assumption. A friendly smile, sincerity, politeness and good listening
habits can push this assumption to the positive side.
Position in Company ~ Of the three’s A’s, attitude is the most helpful here,
Have you noticed the upper management tend to exude confidence and a
positive attitude? Body language is important – walk taller, hold shoulders back,
and make excellent eye contact.
Income ~ This assumption often reverts back to appearance, one that you can
correct quickly.
Level of Success ~ As we mentioned earlier, attitude is contagious.
Name & Model of Car ~ This is an odd one and one I have never figured out.
Marital Status ~ While it is not appropriate to ask people often assume that
married people are more stable.
Level of Confidence ~ This assumption is based on your attitude, experience,
and self- esteem, which in turn is affected by your appearance 7 actions
Company Image ~ Remember…You are the company. The way you present
yourself is precisely how others perceive the company you work for.

Body Language Basics
Body language is the single most important means we have of getting our point
across. Over 50% of our communication is accomplished through our posture
and gestures. Body language can add to or detract from your professional
image.
Posture
Good posture, whether sitting or standing, presents a confident image.
• Stand and sit up straight
• Head up
• Shoulders back
• Feet flat on the ground approximately shoulder width apart
• Arms should be relax at your side
Walk
When entering a room, walk in with confidence and purpose. Maintain good
posture. Keep you head up and your eyes off the floor. Lift your feet up, avoid
dragging them along the ground. Keep your arms at your side, a nice easy swing
that matches your stride. A relaxed yet purposeful walk communicates high self-
esteem and commendable confidence.
Gestures
Be aware of your gestures at all times. When speaking with others, make certain
your gestures enhance your message and don’t detract from it. Gestures should
be open and friendly. Avoid doing anything that is going to detract from your
professionalism and the message you are trying to convey.
Eye Contact
Eye contact is builds trust and develops rapport with others. Looking people in
the eye lets them know you are interested in what is happening, you are
involved, you are self-confident and a professional. Avoiding eye contact makes
people believe you lack confidence, are nervous and unprepared, and worst of all
you might not be trust worthy.
It is recommended that you maintain eye contact approximately 95% of the time
when you are engaged in a one-on-one conversation, and up to 50% of the time
when in a group setting.

Facial Expressions
Your face offers a veritable wealth of information, not just your age and heritage.
Your expressions, or sometimes lack of, give away your innermost attitudes.
Some expressions may make you appear unfriendly, angry, or disinterested. A
warm sincere smile on the other hand, allows you to appear friendly, open, and
approachable, and may be one of your best accessories.
Handshake
Americans traditionally shake hands when meeting or leaving someone for the
first time, or when reconnecting with a person. An appropriate handshake is
between right hands only (unless your right hand is disabled), web-to-web
contact with locked thumbs, and care given to not grab the other person’s
knuckles. A firm grasp that lasts long enough for two to five substantial pumps is
essential.
Every handshake should begin from a standing position, ladies as well as men.
There is no gender distinction in business today. The rest goes as follows:
extend your right hand, initiate eye contact, say an enthusiastic hello, slowly and
clearly state your first and last name, and be sure to smile.
The handshakes you should avoid:
• The limp, dead fish handshake
• The double-handed handshake, often called the politician or pastoral
handshake
• The bone-crusher handshake
• The cold, clammy handshake
Business Tip: Name Badge
 Always place your name badge on your right shoulder where it can be readily
seen. The nametag’s purpose is to reinforce your name. When you meet
someone and shake hands, their gaze will automatically follow your right arm
up to your shoulder and then to your face. Place your nametag high enough
on your right shoulder to be easily see.

Introductions
There are two kinds of introductions: self-introductions and three-party introductions.
When do you introduce yourself? When you recognize someone and he or she doesn’t recognize
you, whenever you’re seated next to someone you don’t know, when the introducer doesn’t
remember your name and when you’re the friend of a friend. Extend your hand, offer your first
and last names and share something about yourself or the event you’re attending.
Tip: In a self-introduction, never give yourself an honorific such as Mr., Ms., Dr., etc.
In a three-person introduction, your role is to introduce two people to each other. In a business or
business/social situation, one must take into consideration the rank of the people involved in
order to show appropriate deference. Simply say first the name of the person who should be
shown the greatest respect. And remember, gender doesn’t count in the business world; protocol
is based upon rank. Senior employees outrank junior employees, customers or clients outrank
every employee (even the CEO), and officials (Mayor, Senator, etc.) outrank non-officials.
Begin with the superior’s name, add the introduction phrase, say the other person’s name and
add some information about the second person. Then reverse the introduction by saying the
second’s name, followed by the introduction phrase and the superior’s name and information.
When a three-party intro is done correctly, the two people being introduced should be able to start
some small talk based upon what you shared about each of them. Introductions should match, so
if you know the first and last names of both people, say both. If you know only the first name of
one person, say only the first names of both. If you add an honorific for one person, the other
should also have one.
Examples:
“Mr. Brown, I’d like to introduce Ms. Ann Smith, who started yesterday in the mailroom. Ann, this
is Douglas Brown, our CEO.”
(Ann would be wise to call the CEO “Mr. Brown” right away and not assume she may call him by
his first name. Always use the last names of superiors and clients until you are invited to do
otherwise.)
“Pete, I’d like to introduce to you Doug Brown, our CEO. Doug, I’d like you to meet, Pete
Johnson, who’s considering our firm for his ad campaign.”
Tip: Don’t say “I’d like to introduce you to..”, but rather “I’d like to introduce to you…”
Tip: Always stand for an introduction.
Social skills are important prerequisites to succeeding in business. Knowing how to shake hands
and handle introductions can set you apart from the competition, convey confidence and project a
professional image. Practice these simple skills and you will reap the benefits!

Seven Body Language Killers
In many ways, listeners hear with their eyes. What is your body language saying
about you? When you give a presentation or run a sales meeting, are you
coming across as authoritative, confident and credible, or insecure, disreputable
and out of your league?
When it comes to body language, simply avoiding the most common mistakes
and replacing them with more confident movements will make a big difference.
Killer #1- Avoiding eye contact
What it says about you: You lack confidence; you are nervous and unprepared.
What to do instead: Spend 90% or more of your presentation time looking into
the eyes of your listeners. The vast majority of people spend far too much time
looking down at notes, PowerPoint slides or at the table in front of them. Not
surprisingly, most speakers can change this behavior instantly simply by
watching video of themselves. Powerful business leaders look at their listeners
directly in the eye when delivering their message.
During the recent confirmation hearings for U.S Chief Justice nominee John
Roberts, newspapers praised him for ""looking self-assured."" How did Roberts
project this image? Instead of reading his statements from notes, Roberts looked
his audience of Senators straight in the eye as he delivered his remarks.
Killer #2- Slouching
What it says about you: You are non-authoritative; you lack confidence.
What to do instead: When standing stationary, place feet at shoulder width and
lean slightly forward. Pull your shoulders slightly forward as well -- you'll appear
more masculine. Head and spine should be straight. Don't use a tabletop or
podium as an excuse to lean on it.
Killer #3- Fidgeting, rocking or swaying
What it says about you: You are nervous, unsure or unprepared.
What to do instead: Well, stop fidgeting. Fidgeting, rocking and swaying don't
serve any purpose. I recently worked with the top executive of computer
company who had to deliver the news of a product delay to a major investor. He
and his team actually had the event under control, and had learned valuable
lessons from the failure. But his body language suggested otherwise.
Killer #4- Standing in place
What it says about you: You are rigid, nervous, boring -- not engaging or
dynamic.
Ellen Reddick

801.581.0369

10.
What to do instead: Walk. Move. Most men who come to me for presentation
coaching think they need to stand ridged in one place. What they don't realize is
that movement is not only acceptable, it's welcome. Some of the greatest
business speakers walk into the audience, and are constantly moving... but with
purpose!
For example, a dynamic speaker will walk from one side of the room to another
to deliver their message. But if there's no one in a corner of the room, it doesn't
make sense to go there -- it's not moving with purpose. When I tape my clients
on video, I actually want to see that they move out of frame once in a while.
Otherwise, they appear too rigid.
Killer #5- Keeping hands in pocket
What it says about you: You are uninterested, uncommitted or nervous.
What to do instead: The solution here is too simple: Take your hands out of
your pocket. I've seen great business leaders who never once put both hands in
their pockets during a presentation. One hand is acceptable -- as long as the free
hand is gesturing.
Killer #6- Using phony gestures
What it says about you: You are over coached, unnatural or artificial.
What to do instead: Use gestures; just don't overdo it. Researchers have shown
that gestures reflect complex thought. Gestures leave listeners with the
perception of confidence, competence and control. But the minute you try to copy
a hand gesture, you risk looking contrived -- like a bad politician.
Killer #7- Jingling coins, tapping toes & other annoying movements
What it says about you: You are nervous, unpolished or insufficiently
concerned with details.
What to do instead: Use a video camera to tape yourself. Play it back with a
critical eye. Do you find annoying gestures that you weren't aware of? I once
watched an author who had written a book on leadership discuss his project. He
couldn't help but jingle all the coins in his pocket throughout the entire talk. He
didn't sell very many books that day, and he certainly didn't score points on the
leadership scale.
Nervous energy will reflect itself in toe-tapping, touching your face or moving
your leg up and down. It's an easy fix once you catch yourself in the act!
Use your body as a positive communication tool!

How to Write a Handwritten Note
Only three or four sentences long, a thank you/hand written note is a
golden opportunity to make the sort of personal connection that builds
stronger professional relationships.
Hand write a note whenever possible. It says you took the time to think about
what you were writing. The person receiving your note will appreciate your
thoughtfulness and will not be grading your penmanship.
A simple fold-over note card, a black or blue pen, a stamp and little effort are
all you need. A good thank you/hand written note that gets mailed is better
than the perfect one that never gets written.
The six elements of a basic thank you note:

How Does Your Office Welcome Clients?
A new client is coming to visit--and panic sets in. What will they think? Will they
have a favorable experience that encourages them to do business with you? Or
will they leave your facilities wondering how to contact your competition?
When customers visit, they form an impression of your business. That impression
becomes your image. Whether the visit involves a business transaction, a service
call or a corporate event--whether it's for only an hour or a full day--you need to
create positive impressions for everyone.
Here are some tips for receiving visitors graciously:
• Create a welcoming atmosphere

18.
Have you trained your receptionist (or the first person your clients see) to smile
and greet every visitor who comes to the office? That first contact can affect
perceptions about the company. If this person is on the phone or occupied with
another customer, do they acknowledge the visitor with a glance or a smile? Or
do they ignore the visitor? Do customers have to hunt around for someone to
assist them?
If you know ahead of time that the client is coming, make sure everyone knows
the name of the visitor. The receptionist should be prepared with a name badge
or a visitor's pass. Be sure every visitor is greeted in a friendly and helpful way.
• Set professional standards
A client visited a car dealership on a Saturday afternoon. The sales
representative who greeted her was dressed in a white tank top that exposed her
belly button; she also wore a pair of tight black jeans and black-and-white
sneakers. The client took one look at her and decided to go to another
dealership--her competitor.
Are your employees appropriately dressed? Do they always project a
professional image, even on business-casual days? Or are they dressed a little
too casually? Your employees represent the company; their appearance should
reflect that at all times. Think about how their appearance can enhance or detract
from your corporate image.
• Act as the host
When you receive visitors, you are the host. The way you greet them in your
office can affect the outcome of the meeting. So set the tone for a positive
encounter.
Don't keep your visitors waiting. If the receptionist is escorting them to your
office, be sure to come out from behind your desk to greet them. Stand to shake
hands, and shake ""web to web""--that is, grasp the other hand fully with your
hand-don't simply clasp the other person's fingers. Shake in the same manner
with men and women alike.
To create the best impression, personally greet the visitors in the waiting room.
Shake hands with your guests and escort them to your office, letting them follow

you. Upon arrival at your office, allow them to proceed first into the room, and
indicate where they should sit. Do not seat your guests directly across from your
desk; instead, place their chairs to the side of the desk.
Don't accept calls or interruptions during the meeting. When the meeting is over,
stand, shake hands once again and walk your guests back to the waiting room.
• Make the proper introductions
Introductions may seem like a trivial item in the grand scheme of business
interactions, but they are crucial to setting a professional tone in the office. If
clients are at your location for the entire day, make an effort to introduce them to
your senior executives. This simple gesture will help your guests to feel welcome.
As you escort a client through the office, you may run into company employees.
Be sure to make the proper introductions. When deciding who should be
introduced first, use the following order, regardless of gender: client, senior
executives, and junior executives. Provide information about each person you
introduce, so these people can start a conversation. For example: ""Mr. Harris
(client), I would like you to meet Ms. Jones (company president). Mr. Harris is our
new client from Chicago; Ms. Jones is our company president."" Show equal
respect and gracious behavior to everyone in your office. Your clients will notice
how you treat everyone.
• Be conscious of office courtesies
When escorting a client for a product demonstration or a company tour, use
proper office courtesies. One should never, for instance, discuss office gossip or
talk negatively about company employees in front of guests. I have sat in
reception areas and overheard employees talk about things and people that gave
me a very unflattering view of the company. The same should be applied to
employees that walk through the office talking on their cell phone. You never
know who may overhear a remark that should not be heard at all.
Know the appropriate way to handle entrances, exits, revolving doors and
elevators. As the host, when you get to a door, open it. This rule applies
regardless of gender. It is polite to hold the door for your guest to enter. At
revolving doors, the host enters the door first, leading the way for guests. As you
enter, you might want to say, ""I'll wait for you on the other side."" Then do so. If
there is more than one person with you, wait until everyone is through the
revolving door before you proceed.
When navigating stairs and escalators, the host leads the way, whether you are
going up or down. When using elevators, allow your guests to enter before you
do; upon exiting, leave the elevator first and hold the door for those following.

People at the front of the elevator should step off to make room when those in
the back need to exit. Hold the door, allow them to leave and step back into the
elevator. This is much nicer than cramming your body to the sidewall so that they
have room to leave.
Companies that want to stand out from their competition pay attention to making
visitors welcome. Manners make the difference. Greet your visitors graciously,
know what to do during their visit, be considerate of others and create positive
impressions that last and last.
Make a client visit to your company another selling opportunity and reaffirm that
your company deserves their business.
Sound as Good as You Look
Speaking with Ease
Every time you open your mouth and speak, your professionalism is on display.
What you say and how you say it is extremely important to your professional
image.
What we say is not as important as how we make people feel.
Make certain your speech doesn’t detract from your professionalism by paying
attention to the following:

• Listen to the sound of your own voice. Keep it warm and inviting.
People with a higher than normal voice are thought to be less intelligent
than those with a lower voice. One way to improve the sound of your
voice is to read out loud to yourself every day for 5 or 10 minutes. Read
quality literature, the Bible, poetry, Shakespeare, the classics.
• Speak slowly, clearly and distinctly. Make it easy for the person you
are speaking with to hear and understand what it is you are saying.
• Eliminate the use of non-words. Non-words are meaningless fillers that
speckle our speech, distract from our message, drain our impact, and
annoy our listener. The most common non-words are “uhh,” “ahh,” and
“um.” They also include words such as “like,” “you know,” “well,” “so,”
“okay?” and “sort of.” The excessive use of non-words can undermine
your credibility and make you appear weak and ill-prepared.
• Always use proper grammar. Nothing detracts from your
professionalism faster than using the incorrect tense of a verb or an
incorrect word.
• Avoid using slang such as “hi guys,” “how ya doin,” or casual phrases
like whatever” while rolling your eyes.
NEVER refer to a group of people as “You guys.”
• Avoid poor diction. Often people don’t realize they are using poor
diction because it becomes a verbal habit.

Social Intelligence
In his new book Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman wrote “Listening poorly is
the common cold of social intelligence. And it is being made worse by
technology. To have a human moment, you need to be fully present. You
have to be away from your laptop, put down your BlackBerry, you end your
daydream and you pay full attention to the person you are with. It may sound
rudimentary but think about how often we just keep multitasking and half pay
attention. We each need to live in the moment fully engaged in what we are
doing.”

SIX KEYS TO STRONG EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE
Self-awareness, self-control and empathy form the foundation of strong
emotional intelligence, followed by social expertness, personal
influence and mastery of vision.
• Self-awareness. Knowing what influences our feelings, positively or negatively,
is critical. It’s very important to realize what kinds of situations can put us over
the edge before we get there.
• Self-control. Once we know our “triggers,” we can implement coping
mechanisms. For instance, just knowing that getting cut off on the highway

produces intense feelings of rage (self-awareness), we can decide to cope better
while driving by listening to soothing music or a recorded
book (self-control).
• Empathy. We must cultivate the ability to look at a situation from another’s
perspective. In our driving example, consider that the driver who cut you off might
have been someone helping an expectant
mother get to the hospital.
• Social expertness. The ability to build relationships requires empathy,
excellent communication skills, and the ability to listen well.
• Personal influence. All leaders are, by definition, required to influence and
persuade others to follow them. This is impossible to do without the qualities
listed above.
• Mastery of vision. A mission statement of sorts outlines intentions and values.
Cell Phones - The Worst Offenses

these five unacceptable behaviors, from most reprehensible to least.
1. Accepting a personal call while in a meeting or presentation
2. Answering the phone or emails while at a business dinner
3. Talking on the phone while in the bathroom
4. Talking on the phone while in close quarters (such as a train, plane, or bus)
5. Answering a work call or email during personal time after work hours

The Top Eight Rules of Proper Cell Phone Etiquette at Work
A recent study showed that at least 40% of U.S. companies now have a
published cell phone usage policy at work. That percentage will most certainly
rise in the near future. It might be more difficult for the employees of the majority
of firms that have yet to adopt an acceptable use policy. To avoid suffering a
career detour from unacceptable cell phone use in your office, consider the
following generally accepted rules of good cell phone behavior.
1. Turn your ringer OFF or set to “vibrate”. Unless your cell phone is a
company-issued handset for business use, set your unit to vibrate while at
your desk. Even if you’ve selected a tasteful ring tone, repetitive incoming
calls will be noticed (negatively) by co-workers and management.
2. Let “bread and milk” and other unimportant calls go to voicemail.
While it’s wonderful to have a live connection to the important people in
your life, children, parents, other family and friends, frequent chatty calls
during your workday will often reflect negatively on your perceived
concentration on your duties.
3. When you must use your cell phone, find a private, quiet place to
make your calls. Regardless of where you are, most etiquette advisors
agree you should always observe the “ten-foot rule”. Maintain a buffer
zone of at least ten feet from others while you’re using your cell phone.
While at work, you should make every attempt to expand basic etiquette
and find locations that do not infringe on co-workers trying to perform their
jobs.
4. Don’t bring your cell phone to meetings. Neglecting this one rule can
do career damage even when you adhere to most of the other
recommendations. Some etiquette gurus recommend that, should an
important call be expected, either for business or a family emergency, you
could put your cell phone on “vibrate” and bring it with you. Treat this
exception with extreme caution, however. Regardless of the urgency of
the expected call, your boss will most certainly take a very dim view of a
meeting interruption because of your cell phone. It is a far better idea to
leave your cell phone at your desk to avoid any “interruption temptation”.
5. Never use your cell phone in restrooms. This rule may, at first, appear
frivolous, but the statistics indicate it is an important component of cell
phone etiquette. Why? You often do not know who else may be using the
facilities. Should you communicate private information or sensitive work
issues, you may easily be overheard without your knowledge. There are
some well-documented horror stories of information delivered into the
wrong hands by this simple, innocuous rule violation.
6. Eliminating embarrassing ring tones. Should you have a psychological
need to use a cutesy or outrageous ring tone while away from your job, be
very careful when you are at work. Either keep your cell phone on vibrate
at all times at work or change to a more professional ring tone during your
Ellen Reddick

31.
work day. Along with annoying both co-workers and supervisors, a silly
ring tone can negatively impact your career by displaying a less than
professional, serious image to management.
7. Maintain a low voice during cell phone conversations. Often called
“holding court”, having loud conversations about nothing, a loud voice can
be extremely annoying to anyone within earshot. Often, the ten-foot rule
becomes useless during one of these situations. Unless you are in the
middle of a loud construction site, you should understand that cell phone
microphones are very sensitive and only inches away from your mouth.
There is normally no need to increase your voice to levels used by
seminar leaders talking without microphones.
8. Use text messages instead of voice calls to maintain
professionalism. If you need to communicate on a personal level and
understand that voice calls would be inappropriate, send a text message
to your caller. It’s quiet, fast, and to the point. Unless you’re trying to set a
world’s record for the largest thumbs on the planet, a few text messages
during the workday keeps your lines of communications open without
wasting your time or annoying co-workers.
Try to remember that, through most of recorded history, the world of business
operated quite effectively without constant cell phone use. The basic substance
of successful business operations contains no requirement that cell phones
contribute mightily to your company’s bottom line. Be ready for a formal company
policy regarding cell phone use at work. More and more firms, many reaching
unacceptable levels of frustration, will be joining those who have already
published regulations and publishing restrictive policies.
By following the current rules of good cell phone etiquette, you’ll not only be
ahead of the curve, you may enhance your professional standing at work by
displaying this considerate behavior. Some of your cell phone etiquette may even
be transferred to your friends who might be in need of some guidelines, too.
Professional e-mail Etiquette Guidelines
""There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are
evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how
we say it."" - Dale Carnegie (1888-1955) American Educator
When it comes to your business e-mail communications, you need to make an
impression that can lend to the determination that you are a credible professional
enterprise and someone that will be easy and a pleasure to do business with. You only
have one chance to make that first impression which will be invaluable to building trust
and confidence.

commercial e-mail sent.
SUBJECT The window into your e-mail and can determine if your e-mail will be

When it comes to business, regardless of mode of communication used,
professionalism and courtesy never go out of style!
Business email etiquette speaks volumes about the sender and the
company where the message was originated.
Keep your professional image at all times following these simple
rules. They are not hard and all the benefits will be yours.
Top 10 List of SMS Etiquette
Text messaging is one of the simplest and most useful means of mobile
communication. No one can doubt the popularity of text messaging and short
messaging service (SMS) in particular - more than 50 billion SMS messages
were sent across the world's GSM networks in the first quarter of 2005, a fivefold
increase over the previous year - and there's no slowdown in sight.
1. Common courtesy still rules. Contrary to popular belief, composing an
SMS while you're in a face-to-face conversation with someone is just
about as rude as taking a voice call.
2. Remember that SMS is informal. SMS shouldn't be used for formal
invitations or to dump your girlfriend or boyfriend. The casualness of SMS
diminishes the strength and meaning of the message.
Ellen Reddick

3. Don't get upset if you don't get a reply. Before you text someone and get
frustrated at the lack of a response, be sure that they're familiar with how
to use the service, and that their carrier will accept messages from yours.
4. Be aware of your tone. It is extremely difficult to discern tone in text
messages, just as in e-mail. What seems to you to be a completely
innocuous message may be grossly misinterpreted by the recipient,
causing certain discomfort if not irreparable harm.
5. Don't SMS while you're driving. Talking on the phone is bad enough. You
won't know what hit you - or what you hit - if you are pounding out a
message on your keyboard.
6. Leave the slang to the kids. Don't expect your stodgy superiors at work to
be hip to the lingo of the SMS streets. And don't expect to win points with
your kids by trying to be cool, either.
7. Remember that SMS can be traced. Anonymous messages - if you must
send them -are still best sent from Web sites.
8. Be conscientious of others' schedules. Don't assume that because you are
awake, working, not busy, or sober that the person you're texting is as
well. Many a pleasant slumber have been interrupted by recurring ""beep-
beep...beep-beeps"" of messages.
9. If it's immediate, make a voice call. If you can't get through and your text
message is ignored, there's probably a good reason. There are still some
times when people don't even have a thumb free to respond.
10. Remember that your phone does have an off button. There are very, very
few things in the world that absolutely cannot wait.
General Dining Etiquette
It is important to know how to conduct oneself properly at the table. The rules of
dining etiquette are fairly straightforward and mostly require common sense.
Table Setting. It can be very confusing to be presented with a variety of eating
utensils. (See below) Remember the guideline “to start at the outside and work
your way in.” If you have been given two forks, which are the same size, begin
with the fork on the outside. Many restaurants use the same size of fork for both
the salad and main course.
Ellen Reddick

35.
Napkin. When dining with others place your napkin on your lap after everyone at
your table has been seated. Do not open your napkin in mid-air. As you remove
your napkin from the table begin to open below the table level and place on your
lap. If you must leave a meal, do so between courses, and place your napkin on
your chair or to the left of your plate. When a meal is completed, place your
napkin to the right of your plate – never on the plate.
Served. Wait for everyone at your table to be served before beginning to eat.
However, if an individual who has not been served encourages you to begin
eating, you may do so. Eat slowly while waiting for their food to be served.
Soup. When eating soup, think of making a circle: spoon away from you, bring
around to your mouth and back to the bowl. Soup is taken from the side of the
soup spoon –it is not inserted into your mouth. Do not slurp or make noises when
eating soup.
Sorbet. This item is often served between courses to cleanse the palate. It is a
light, sherbet texture and depending on when served may be eaten with a fork or
a spoon.
Utensils. Be careful how you hold your utensils. Many people tend to make a fist
around the handle of the utensil – this is the way a young child would grasp a
utensil (not an adult). There are two acceptable ways to use the knife and fork:
continental fashion and American standard. Continental fashion—the diner cuts
the food usually one bite at a time and uses the fork in the left hand, tines
Ellen Reddick
35
Impact Factory

801.581.0369

36.
pointing down, to spear the food and bring it to the mouth. American standard—a
few bites are cut, the knife is laid across the top of the plate, sharp edge toward
you, and the fork is switched to the right hand, if right-handed, tines up to bring
the food to the mouth. (Do not cut more than two or three bites at a time.)
Dessert Utensils. Dessert utensils may be found placed across the top of the
place setting. Place these utensils down for use after the main course is removed
(fork to the left and spoon to the right).
Passing. Pass “community food” such as the breadbasket, salt and pepper, and
salad dressing to the right. Always pass the salt and pepper together. When
passing items such as a creamer, syrup pitcher or gravy boat, pass it with the
handle pointing toward the recipient.
Seasoning. Always taste your food first before using any seasonings. Do not
assume it needs to be seasoned.
Sweeteners. Do not be excessive with sugar or sweetener packets. The rule of
thumb is no more than two packets per meal. Do not crumble the packets but
partially tear off a corner, empty the contents and place to the side.
Bread. Bread/rolls should never be eaten whole. Break into smaller, more
manageable pieces, buttering only one bite at a time. Toast and garlic bread
however may be eaten as whole pieces since they are usually already buttered.
If you are served a piping hot muffin or biscuit, you may break in half crosswise,
butter and put back together. However when ready to actually eat, break it into
small pieces.
Glasses. A variety of types and sizes of glasses can be used throughout the
meal. Remember your items to drink will be located in the area above your knife
and spoon. Coffee cups may be located to the right of the knife and spoon.
Alcohol. Alcohol, if consumed, should be in moderation. In most cases you may
have a drink during the social hour and wine(s) with the dinner. You do not have
to finish your drink. In fact slowly sipping is recommended. If you do not want an
alcoholic drink politely decline.
Buffets. Buffets provide an opportunity to select items you enjoy. Do not
overload your plate. Select a balanced variety of food items.
Pre-Set Meals. With a pre-set meal the host/hostess has already made the
selections and the individuals are served. If allergic, religious or vegetarian
issues arise, quietly deal with these as the server is at your side. For vegetarian
ask if you may have a vegetable plate; with allergies or religion provide the

37.
server with some options (ex. Allergic to shellfish—ask if they have cod or
flounder and be ready with your preference). This lets the server know what you
can eat. Always eat a little of all items served to you.
Ordering from Menu. As the guest select an item that is in the mid-price range,
easy to eat and you will enjoy. Consider asking your host/hostess for a
recommendation before making your decision. As the host it is helpful to take the
lead in ordering appetizers and wine, if these are to be served.
Finished. When finished with a course, leave your plates in the same position
that they were presented to you. In other words, do not push your plates away or
stack them.
Guest. If you are someone’s guest at a meal, ask the person what he/she
recommends. By doing this, you will learn price range guidelines and have an
idea of what to order. Usually order an item in the mid price range. Also keep in
mind, the person who typically initiates the meal will pay. Remember to thank
them for the meal.
Restaurant Staff. Wait staff, servers, Maitre d’, etc. are your allies. They can
assist you with whatever problem may arise. Quietly get their attention and speak
to them about the issue.
12 Common Dining Mistakes
Today more business is done while dining than ever before. Sales can be lost and careers short-
circuited when poor table manners are displayed. Remember, your table manners are a gift you
give those with whom you dine. They also indicate whether or not you know how to show respect
for others. The following are the most common mistakes noted while dining.
1. Misusing silverware
Gripping the fork and knife incorrectly is the most obvious and common faux pas. Knives
are meant to cut, not saw. The fork and knife should never teeter half off the plate onto
the table. Don't wave your silverware in the air while talking. Silverware placed at the top

37

38.
of the plate is for dessert. Place only the silverware that you have used on the plate when
finished.
2. Using the wrong butter plate
There's a simple rule to remember: liquids to the right, solids to the left. Your butter plate
will be near your fork, not your knife.
3. Buttering an entire roll
Bread and rolls are meant to be torn, not cut. A large roll would be torn in half first, then a
smaller piece can be torn off, buttered and eaten. Toast is the exception. The entire piece
can be buttered at once.
4. Improper use of the napkin
The napkin comes off the table only after everyone is seated. It is used to dab the lips,
not scrub the face. If leaving the table temporarily mid-meal, place the napkin on your
chair. At the end of the meal, place it on the table next to your plate, never on the plate,
however.
5. Eating too fast or too slow
Pacing is important when dining with others. Slow down if you notice you're faster than
everyone else. Speed up or leave some food if you're a slow eater. You should never
leave your guest to dine alone, which happens if you're finished way ahead of your guest.
6. Showing food in mouth
This happens when you've taken too big of a bite and then chew with your mouth open,
or continue to talk. This is very unappetizing for others to observe. Small bites are
necessary when trying to converse while eating.
7. Seasoning food before tasting
Without tasting your food, how would you know it really needs seasoning? This can be
seen as an insult to the chef and host. It also can indicate that you jump to conclusions.
8. Washing food down with liquids
The mouth should be cleared of food before beverages are sipped. It's a good habit to
get into, especially with wine. Wine is meant to cleanse the palate and its taste can't fully
be appreciated with food still in the mouth.
9. Passing food incorrectly
The salt is always passed with the pepper. Anything with a handle, such as the creamer,
is passed so the handle is facing the person receiving the item. This is why the correct
way to pass food the first time around is to the right=counterclockwise.
10. Leaving lipstick marks
Lipstick should be well blotted so not to leave marks on cups and glasses. It's a real
turnoff.
11. Grooming at the table
This is another turnoff. Don't touch your hair or apply makeup while at the table. And
certainly don't pick your teeth at the table. Excuse yourself from the table to remove
something from your teeth...or to apply makeup.
12. Poor posture
Sit up straight, don't lean on your elbows or forearms, don't rock in your chair, and keep
your elbows close to your side.
When You are the Host
Doing business over meals is a ritual that has existed for centuries. Taking
clients to breakfast, lunch or dinner has long been an effective way to build
relationships, make the sale or seal the deal. These business meals are
essentially business meetings. Knowledge of your product or your service is

crucial to the success of the meeting, but so are your manners. Too many people
jeopardize an opportunity because they fail to use good dining etiquette. Here
are a few basic rules to make the experience pleasurable and profitable:
• Know your duties as the host. You are in charge. It is up to you to see that
things go well and that your guests are comfortable. You need to attend to every
detail, from extending the invitation to paying the bill.
• Plan ahead when you issue the invitation. Allow a week for a business
dinner and three days for lunch. Be certain that the date works for you. That
might sound obvious, but if you have to cancel or postpone, you can look
disorganized and disrespectful of your client's time.
• Select a restaurant that you know, preferably one where you are known. This
is no time to try out the latest hot spot. Being confident of the quality of the food
and service leaves you free to focus on business.
• Consider the atmosphere. Does it lend itself to conversation and discussion?
If you and your clients cannot hear each other over the roar of the diners and
dishes, you will have wasted your time and money.
• Let the staff know that you will be dining with clients. If your guests suggest
a restaurant new to you, call ahead and speak with the maître d'. Make it clear
that you will be having a business meal and picking up the check.
• Arrive early. This is the perfect time to give your credit card to the maître d’,
and avoid the awkwardness that can accompany the arrival of the bill.
• Take charge of seating. Your guests should have the prime seats—the ones
with the view. As the host, take the least desirable spot—the one facing the wall,
the kitchen or the restrooms.
• Allow your guests to order first. However, you might suggest certain dishes
to be helpful. By recommending specific items, you are indicating a price range.
Order as many courses as your guests, no more and no less, to facilitate the flow
of the meal. It is awkward if one of you orders an appetizer or dessert and the
others do not
• As the host, you are the one who decides when to start discussing
business. That will depend on a number of factors such as the time of day and
how well you know your clients. At breakfast, time is short, so get down to
business quickly. At lunch, wait until you have ordered so you will not be
interrupted. Dinner, which tends to be the most social meal, is a time for building
rapport. Limit the business talk, and do it after the main course is completed.

• When you know your clients well, you have more of a basis for small talk.
However, because you have established a business friendship, you can eliminate
some of the chitchat when time is an issue. When you don't know your clients
well, spend more time getting acquainted before launching your shoptalk.
• Handle ANY disasters with grace. With all your attention to detail, things can
still go wrong. The food may not be up to your standards, the waiter might be
rude or the people at the next table boisterous and out of control. Whatever
happens, be part of the solution not the problem. Excuse yourself to discuss any
problems with the staff.
• Limit the alcohol you drink. The three-martini lunch is mostly a thing of the
past. However, cocktails and wine are still part of the business dinner. Since
alcohol can have the same effect as truth serum, keep your consumption to one
or two glasses. When guests are drinking liberally and you sense trouble, excuse
yourself and discreetly ask the server to hold back on refilling the wine glasses or
offering another cocktail.
Your conduct throughout the meal will determine professional success. If you pay
attention to the details and make every effort to see that your clients have a
pleasant experience, they will assume that you will handle their business the
same way. You are laying a foundation for a solid, powerful business relationship
by paying attention to details.
When You are the Guest
The business meal has become standard operating procedure in business. Over
half of all business is finalized at some type of a meal and job interviews often
include a meal as part of the interview process. Many times we are put on the
spot and our behavior and manners are on display. Knowing what it takes to be
someone’s guest at a business meal is as important as being the host. The

following guidelines will help you make a positive impression when you are the
guest:
• Confirm the day and time if the invitation was made more than a week in
advance.
• Arrive on time. Call ahead if you will be more than five minutes late. If
you cannot reach your host directly, call the restaurant and leave a
message with the maitre d’.
• Follow your host’s lead in ordering beverages.
• Order an entrée from the menu in the average price range. Ask for
suggestions from the host. Don’t order the most expensive item on the
menu.
• Do everything in moderation. It is not your last meal, so don’t stuff
yourself. If you are on an interview, don’t drink alcohol. Otherwise, if the
occasion calls for a drink, never over do it.
• Do not complain about the service or the meal. Remember that your host
is paying for the meal and you should behave graciously,
• Set a comfortable atmosphere and ask questions to encourage
conversation.
• If you must cancel, call personally, apologize and suggest a rescheduling.
• Thank your host for the meal and their time. Send a thank you note to
your host. It takes a short time but makes a big impression

• In the business environment, you plan every
move with potential clients.

• You arrange for the appointment, you prepare
for the meeting, you rehearse for the
presentation, you prepare as a host for dining
with clients, but in spite of your best efforts,
potential clients pop up in the most
unexpected places. Leave nothing to chance.
Every time you walk out of your office, be
ready to make a powerful first impression…it

Another piece of shock news as Michael Jackson dies unexpectedly at what is a relatively young age of 50. And of course we are all both horrified and fascinated by it, whether or not we were ever fans of him or his music. These kind of unexpected twists, especially in relation to someone we all know about, highlight the tragic nature of our existence. Because there is a Michael Jackson in us all. A combination of being very public and very reclusive, wanting people to know and recognize us and yet wanting to have our own space. And, like him, conflicted about our identities and with low points matching the highs. The media are having a field day speculating about his health, his childhood, his mental state, his apparent loneliness, his talent, now tinged with a kind of wistful speculation as to what might have been had he lived longer.

It’s not quite another Princess Diana moment, but as with all celebrity lives and deaths these things hold up a mirror to ourselves, our own hopes and aspirations, and the reality of our struggles. An opportunity to face up to the baggage we all inherit from childhood, and also to reflect on the contribution we can make to the wellbeing of those who come after us. Whatever the truth about Michael Jackson’s lifestyle and health, his music will live on in the lives of his many fans. Thanks for the memories. RIP Michael Jackson – a ‘Rare Iconic Personality’.

It’s not very often that baptisms get into the tabloid press, though bishops quite often do – frequently for the wrong reasons. But this story surely highlights both a growing trend for the baptism of adult converts, and also shows that a bit of spectacle can be a good thing in terms of getting into the news. Maybe if more of church happened outside the four walls of church buildings, there would be more interest by the general public. There’s something safe about being able to stand on a river bank to be part of worship, as compared with being trapped in pews or behind closed doors. But then, John the Baptist knew all about that a long time ago.

This week saw the end of a long process to launch the Mission Shaped Ministry course in Scotland. The course itself emerged out of the Fresh Expressionsinitiative of the Church of England and Methodists to encourage new forms of church – and it’s been successful way beyond anyone’s wildest dreams in England, Wales, and Ireland.

Scotland has had to wait a bit longer, but in September-October this year there will be a six-week taster (Mission Shaped Intro) in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and then starting in January 2010 the entire course will be presented in Glasgow and Inverness. The church mice will be involved in Inverness, along with Duncan Macpheron, minister of Hilton Church, while the Glasgow course will be led by Alan McWilliam and David Currie.

We took a couple of days off this week, thinking that June might actually be summer in Scotland. How wrong can you be! It wasn’t just all four seasons in the proverbial 24 hours, but all four of them in the space of about 40 minutes. The drive to Glasgow on Monday started in dull, though dry weather as we left rural Aberdeenhire, but by the time we were passing Stirling there was actually snow at the side of the road. We had to look at least twice, but sure enough – not hailstones, but real snow. Not to mention a sky as black as night and flooding all over the place. Then just 15 minutes later, bright sunshine, which continued all the way to Glasgow and for the rest of the day. Still, it was just as well that the main attraction was not outdoors.

And it was well worth travelling through fire and brimstone to be there! The main attraction was a concert by The Priests, three Irish priests who’ve just shot to fame from nowhere in less than 12 months following the release of their first album last Christmas.

In an obviously unscripted dialogue, their informal laid-back style of conversation throughout the concert was something else. Fun, faith, spontaneity, and a lot of easy talk about God and the spiritual, not to mention their fantastic singing just made it a great occasion. And where else would you find a concert where the most prominent projected icon is a cross? And it wasn’t all a bunch of old grannies either: we sat next to a couple of twenty-something young women who must have been first in line to get there, and whose excitement at seeing The Priests in person was … well, infectious.

Next day we went to see an exhibition of Edvard Munch’s work, which (as we expected) evoked the exact opposite set of emotions, with his obsessions with failed love affairs, death and, of course, stress – most famously expressed in his painting The Scream.

But as well as that there are various versions of his Madonna on display, along with an intriguing portrait of Nietzsche, and a striking self-portrait. The exhibition runs till September, and is free so well worth a visit if you like that sort of thing.

After that, a walk down the street to the Kelvingrove Gallery to take (yet another) look at Salvador Dali’s Christ of St John of the Cross,

and while we were viewing that we had an unexpected (and free) organ recital.

Of course, all this was interspersed with new conversations, about the meaning of life, faith, spirituality, theology … and how cool it would be to have The Priests as pastors. And on the way home we called by this interesting studio. A two day outing doing these things probably tells you something about us …

We’ll comment on the book and its contents once we’ve finished reading it, and had a chance to talk about it. But the question of whether fresh expressions of church are really as fresh as we all think came to our attention with the recent death of the Revd Bill Shergold. He’s not typically hailed as one of the heroes of either fresh expressions or emerging church, and quite likely most readers of this blog will be wondering who exactly he was and why we should be bothered to mark his passing. After all, he was 89 when he died last month. And he trained as a priest at Mirfield, a high church college if ever there was one. And his most significant ministry was at the Eton Mission in London, with close connections with the posh school that gave it its name. So you might think he would be about the last person to have pioneered anything remotely missional, let alone truly creative. And you’d be wrong. He was the founder of the 59 Club, a bikers community, which he started when he realized that here was a way of connecting faith with what at the time (the 1950s) was a growing recreational trend among young men in particular. To read the story of how and why he did this, in his own words, go here. He clearly thought he was just doing what came naturally, given his calling as a parish priest, and his efforts were not blessed with all the trendy terminology that seems an essential part of the emerging, emergent, fresh expressions scene today. Which we all probably need to be reminded of: that there have always been mavericks and pioneers who saw missional openings in unlikely places and who stepped outside of the box in order to see where God might be at work. Bill Shergold was one of them. And at a time when Christians were far less tolerant of the non-traditional than they are today. But then, he did, as a newspaper headline of the time says, wear ‘leathers under his cassock’ – which, obviously, means that he wore a cassock over his leathers. When so many are preferring to dispose of cassocks and other bits of tradition, we might have something to learn from him.

This week has certainly been a long time for UK politicians, most notably Gordon Brown, who looks like being on his way out as prime minister. He makes a lot of having been raised in a Church of Scotland manse, and his Presbyterian values and ‘moral compass’, though the point of all that is probably a bit lost on many people today, if for no other reason than they’ve heard it so many times now and it’s not altogether clear what it all amounts to. What can in one context be tenacity and commitment can all too easily become stubbornness and aggression. Ask any Presbyterian! The ‘I’m right and you’re all wrong’ attitude has been the cause of many splits and schisms over the years (centuries even) not just in Presbyterian circles, but throughout Scottish churches more generally. One thing we’re thinking about right now is whether this sort of righteousness is an inevitable outcome of a certain kind of theology, or whether that connection is secondary, and other factors such as personality type play a bigger role. It’s certainly the case, in our experience anyway, that folks from other backgrounds seem to be a bit more laid back about things, not taking themselves too seriously, and more ready to know when they need to change.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The U.S. Army is laying
the groundwork to let Halliburton Co., keep several billion dollars paid
for work in Iraq that Pentagon auditors say is questionable or unsupported
by proper documentation, the Wall Street Journal reported today.

According to Pentagon documents reviewed by the Journal,
the Army has acknowledged that the Houston-based company might never be
able to account properly for some of its work, which has been probed amid
accusations that Halliburton's Kellogg Brown & Root unit overbilled
the government for some operations in Iraq.

The company has hired a consulting firm to estimate
what Halliburton's services should cost, the report said.

The newspaper, citing the documents and internal memorandums,
said that officials are considering using the estimate to serve as the basis
for ""an equitable settlement,"" under which the Pentagon could
drop many of the claims its auditors have made against the company.

But the Journal added that some disgruntled Pentagon
officials see the effort to broker an outside settlement with the company
as unusual because the contract is so large.

According to the report, Kellogg Brown & Root
so far has billed about $12 billion in Iraq, and about $3 billion of that
remains disputed by government officials.

The Journal also cited Pentagon records showing that
$650 million in Halliburton billings are deemed questionable. An additional
$2 billion is considered to have insufficient paperwork to justify the billing,
the report said.

return a call seeking comment early today.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Q:

I've lived a very sinful life, but a friend of mine says God will forgive me if I'll just believe in Jesus. What difference would that make? And how would I know if I was really forgiven?

A:

Your friend is right: You can be forgiven, and you can know beyond doubt that someday you will go to be with God in heaven forever. And my prayer is that you will take the one step that is necessary for this to become a reality. What is that step? It is the step of faith - trusting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and committing your life to Him.

Let me explain what this means. Only one thing will ever keep us out of heaven, and that is our sin. God is holy and pure, and unless we are cleansed of our sins we can never enter heaven. The Bible says of God, ""Your eyes are too pure to look on evil; you cannot tolerate wrong"" (Habakkuk 1:13). We not only need to be forgiven; we need to be cleansed.

But how is this possible? We can't cleanse ourselves; only God can do it. And this is what He did by sending His Son, Jesus, into the world. He was without sin - but on the cross all our sins were placed on Him, and He took the judgment we deserved. All this was in accordance with God's plan, for God loves us and wanted to provide a way for us to be cleansed and saved.

What must we do? We must turn to Christ, repenting of our sins and trusting Him alone for our salvation. Why not ask Christ to come into your life right now and save you? The Bible says, ""Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved"" (Acts 16:31).",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Piggy-backing on the ongoing Apple Maps drama, The New York Times gives us a couple interesting tidbits that help explain the origins of Google Maps on the iPhone. For starters, Apple never intended to put maps on the iPhone. It was a decision late CEO Steve Jobs made last minute, one that would cost Apple its reputation five years later as Apple rushed its own solution out of the door too early.

In a way, the report notes, Apple Maps continue on a string of Internet services missteps, with notable examples of the recently axed Ping social network for music, Siri, a controversial digital assistant, the MobileMe suite of web tools and recent iCloud outages.

These blunders expose Apple as a hardware and design-focused culture, which is more often than not a difficult match for online services on a world scale, where Google rules the landscape by a wide margin…

Nick Wingfield and Brian Chen filed this report with The New York Times, based on interviews with former Apple engineers:

Including a maps app on the first iPhone was not even part of the company’s original plan as the phone’s unveiling approached in January 2007. Just weeks before the event, Mr. Jobs ordered a mapping app to show off the capabilities of the touch-screen device.

Remarkably, just two engineers managed to scrap together an app for Steve Jobs keynote in three weeks and Apple “hastily cut a deal with Google to use its map data”.

It began to bother executives how much data about the behavior of iPhone users was flowing back to Google, which could see the coordinates of every iPhone user who downloaded a map, the former executive said.

This was all happening at a time when Apple and Google were buddies, with then Google CEO Eric Schmidt having a seat on Apple’s board of directors – even though at that point Google was working on its own mobile operating system, which it had acquired two years earlier, in 2005, in the form of Android, Inc. a Palo Alto startup headed by Andy Rubin, the founder of Danger and now Senior Vice President of Mobile and Digital Content at Google.

The contention erupted in 2008 as Android began introducing iPhone-like features:

That year, Mr. Jobs drove to Google’s headquarters and got into a screaming match with Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and the head of its Android development team, Andy Rubin, as he tried to discourage them from copying the iPhone, according to an account of the meeting in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Mr. Jobs.

Rubin to this date continues to oversee development of Android.

It would take Apple some time to realize what was happening and force Schmidt to resign from the Board “due to potential conflicts of interest”.

This corner Apple has painted itself into with Maps today may never have happened if Jobs hadn’t misplaced his trust in Schmidt.

Here’s Steve Jobs placing a prank call to Starbucks via Google Maps at the iPhone keynote in January 2007.

The report goes on to assert that “Google was blindsided” by the Apple Maps introduction at WWDC 2012, despite numerous reports and Apple’s acquisitions of mapping startups Placebase, Poly9 and C3 Technologies.

A former Apple executive told the paper that Apple was caught off guard by Mapgate:

“They’re embarrassed by it,” he said. Many of the problems are a result of merging map data, some of it flawed, from many sources.

Another source sums it up nicely:

“I always felt if you had to name an Achilles’ heel at Apple, it’s Internet services,” said Andrew Borovsky, a former Apple product designer who worked on MobileMe and now runs his own design firm in New York. “It’s clearly an issue.”

Maps is an important part of iOS 6, but it’s not the most important part. Would the iPhone stop working without Maps? No, it would be just fine. Apple is not going to fail because of a mapping application — they will take their lumps and deliver a better app in the future.

"O'Leary, Pasborg & Friis-Nielsen - Støj

Mark Corroto, AllAboutJazz

In the aptly named Guerilla Series, for Ayler Records, this
trio does, indeed, fight a ""little war,"" recording this limited
release (400 copies) as a hit-and-run ambush of destruction and noise.

Støj is quite surprising for O'Leary, whose previous outings found
him detailing more muted sounds with the likes of Supersilent on St. Fin Barre's (Leo, 2009), Tomasz Stanko on Levitation (Leo, 2005), and Cuong Vu on Waiting
(Leo, 2007). Here, the Irish guitarist teams with the Scandinavian
duo of Stefan Pasborg and Peter Friis-Nielsen, a tipoff that this
album will comprise sabotage and surprise. Drummer Pasborg (the leader
of the Odessa 5 and Ibrahim Electric) and bassist Friis-Nielsen, have
been heard on several hardcore Peter Brötzmann sessions, including Medicina (Atavistic, 2004) and Live At Neferiti (Ayler, 1999).

The route chosen here is fast and loud. The album opens with the
befitting brief track, ""First Tune."" O'Leary fires off swift, crisp
notes over Pasborg's feverish drumming and Friis-Nielsen's thunderous
bass. The trio plays with a cathartic passion, displaying speed and a
sort of controlled tumult. The aptly named ""Kinetic"" follows up with
even more speed. This trio could rival any metal band, except they
also interject bits of free music into this tornado of a recording.
The title track darts and dodges, with Pasborg mixing the pulse and
O'Leary ramping up the intensity.

The trio establishes a pattern of either short intensity, or longer
tracks that build ferocity as the music progresses. What maintains
attention here is the band's ability to inject passion into both a
sliced-up bebop pulse from Pasborg's bass on ""Exit,"" and the slogging
thunder of ""Interference,"" that switches with a boom into rock-n-roll.
From note one, this is a take no prisoners outing.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Lingard, who sparkled on his debut for the Midlandsâ€™ club as he hit four goals in the 4-1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday, is therefore ruled out for the visit of Swansea on Wednesday evening.

The short-term move to Birmingham may be extended if all parties are happy with the way the signing works out but United have also safeguarded against the possibility of Lingard being cup-tied ahead of a possible speedy return to Old Trafford.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Fort Hood Shooter Is Seeking Death Penalty

Tags

FORT HOOD, Texas (AFP) – The army psychiatrist who has admitted to opening fire on fellow soldiers in the Fort Hood massacre is deliberately seeking the death penalty, his stand-by defense attorney said Wednesday.

Lieutenant Colonel Kris Poppe urged a military judge to either prevent Major Nidal Hasan from representing himself at the high-profile trial or allow the court-appointed lawyers tasked with assisting him to be removed from the case.

“It became clear his goal is to remove impediments and obstacles to the death penalty,” Poppe told the court as the second day of Hasan’s trial got underway. “Should he decide he wants to fight the death penalty, then we are here and ready to defend him.”

Hasan interrupted Poppe, declaring “this is a twist of the facts” and insisting he was not trying to martyr himself.

Military judge Colonel Tara Osborn cleared the courtroom to discuss the matter privately with Hasan and then called an early end to the day’s proceedings.

Hasan has repeatedly attempted to plead guilty to killing 13 people and wounding dozens more in the 2009 attack at a Texas military base.

Military law prohibits Hasan from pleading guilty to a capital offense. So he has been given the opportunity to try to convince the jury that he does not deserve death for his actions.

Now aged 42, Hasan was due to deploy to Afghanistan weeks after the attack. He has said he shot the soldiers to protect his fellow Muslims from an “illegal” war.

“The evidence will clearly show I am the shooter,” Hasan declared in his opening statements Tuesday.

The statement, which lasted just a couple minutes, reiterated his radical views.

“We, the mujahedeen, are imperfect Muslims trying to establish a perfect religion in the land of the supreme God,” Hasan said. “I apologize for any mistakes that I made in this endeavor.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Long Summer Light, Epic Landscapes, Wildlife Action!

Southeast Alaska is a land of photo superlatives, from colorful sunrise to magical sunset, the endless opportunities in between will leave even the most seasoned photographer breathless. Every week as the Saltery “C” embarks on a new adventure with a fresh group, the trip script writes itself as we cruise deep into wilderness with no 2 trips being exactly the same in every way. Around every turn of the coastline, behind the next point of land, there is the potential for extraordinary photographic experiences that can’t always be planned, and often exceeds expectations. The excitement never ceases when the scenery changes constantly and wildlife action can appear at any moment! Because Classic Alaska Charters is an overnight charter service we are in no hurry to go anywhere other than where the photographic opportunities, the light, and wildlife, present themselves.

Mountains Rise And Waterfalls Pour!

Standing on the bow of the Saltery “C” you’ll marvel at the geologic landscape that has been created by volcano’s, heaved by tectonics, weathered by glaciers into sculpted valleys of rock granite walls thousands of feet vertical from saltwater! Waterfalls are gushing from the cliff sides everywhere you look, even more when it rains, and that’s often. Several places there’s chances to pull the boat up and under one of these waterfalls for a unique perspective or to just get wet with the purest water on the planet. The dramatic landscape provides amazing light and shadow shows along with the obvious awe inspiring panorama of a safe anchor spot. Kayaking, exploring a snow cave (early summer) and hiking, provide magnificent views and vistas throughout the day. At night, the stars come out and the sky beckons to night photographers eager to capture the Milky Way, a Blue Moon, or the Aurora Borealis, and perhaps even a meteor shower, typically in August. Some of these events ARE predictable, however, like any great photo shoot it all depends on the weather!

Whales, Bald Eagles, And Bears!

Humpback whales by the hundreds arrive in the Ketchikan area in early Spring bubble net feeding along the coastline, often breaching playfully, females with calves close to their side, larger groups coordinating their all day feeding frenzy. Just because we anchor up for the night doesn’t mean the photographic action is over either! Often whales come into the secluded coves we nestle the Saltery “C” in and give us a show. Killer whales are frequent visitors to the Southeast Alaska coastal waters too. Following the migrating salmon they forage and feast right up to river mouths in packs often as many as a dozen. Many an encounter with Orca’s (and humpback whales too!) offer jaw dropping once in a lifetime experiences. For professional photographers it could mean a pay day! Amateurs and the novice photographers with camera’s filling the digital albums would be the envy of their peers.Bald eagles are essentially everywhere and any given hour of any day Captain Rob can make a soaring, diving, swooping bald eagle photo shoot happen. There’s hundreds of species of other magnificent birds to photograph that inhabit the wilderness waters we ply. Pacific and red throated loons, marbeled murrelet, pigeon guillemot, rhinoceros auklet, common murre, are frequent sightings for seabirds. Shore, tidal, and upland birds include belted kingfisher, black bellied plover, harlequin duck, water dipper, hummingbirds, thrushes and swallows. Of course, the list goes on… For serious birders we can supply a complete check list upon your arrival to keep track of your amazing sightings.
Bears! Black and brown bear are plentiful in the remote wilderness areas of Misty Fiords National Monument Wilderness Area with sightings of them nearly every week. For some serious bear photography Captain Rob can make it happen. Along with the bears wandering the tideflats and estuaries, there’s the Alexander Archipelago Wolves that have emerged from the old growth forest more frequently the last few years. Sitka black tailed deer, harbor seals, and Dall porpoise round out the most frequent cooperating subjects.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Armchair Gaming Episode 15- Art, Aesthetics and Games Part 3

Welcome to another episode of Armchair Gaming. The goal for this show is simple: I want to help you learn more about philosophy, and I’ll be using video games as an instrument to help teach it. Today we will continue looking at art, Philosophy of Art and the Beautiful while playing Monster Hunter: World.

In previous episodes we have looked for philosophical themes in games themselves. In this episode, we will be taking a look at the game industry as a whole, to address the argument of video games as a medium of art.

In the last few weeks, we took our first look at whether or not games qualify as art. Being relatively new to human history, relative to other art forms, games have fought for a position in today’s society as more than just an escape from reality. In today’s episode, we will look at how video games have developed in the art community, and how they have changed the topography of the art world forever.

About Armchair Gaming

I had the chance to explore philosophy in high school and I loved it so much that I went on to study it at Trent University, where I obtained a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in philosophy. I feel so strongly about the subject that I often find myself going through the books I had purchased over my university career, as well as adding to the collection regularly.

Philosophy is an amazingly exciting subject that can teach us not just what to think, but how to think. Unfortunately, a lot of people see philosophy as some intimidating monster, with difficult concepts and theories to grasp. Conversely, some see it as a waste of someone’s time and intellect. As someone who has dedicated their life to the subject, this Scholarly Gamer wants to bring philosophy to you in a way that is approachable, sometimes funny, and presented through a medium of great importance to himself and millions of other people around the world: Games.

I hope you’ll join us on this journey. And remember, you never go a day in your life without living some philosophy.

Sheldon was Born and raised in Canada's Capital City, Ottawa, where he came to love 4 things... Metal, Hockey, Knitting and Gaming. Sheldon has a B.A in philosophy from Trent University, and uses his critical analysis and knowledge from his 4 years accidentally ruining everything for everyone.

LLVM Update

This page summarizes the effort of updating LegUp from LLVM 2.9 to LLVM 3.4.

LegUp Source Changes Required

LLVM Header Files Moved/Deprecated

The following header files have been renamed or removed. The functionality seems identical in most cases.

LLVM Objects and Functions Renamed/Deprecated

Red highlighting indicates changes that may cause problems, or may not be functionally correct.

Yellow highlighting indicates changes that are probably fine, but may need to be double checked.

Unhighlighted rows indicate trivial changes that should have little or no effect.

Functionality Added to LegUp

ConstantDataArray

LLVM 3.4 now uses ConstantDataArray in several places where a ConstantArray was used previously.
ConstantDataArray support was added to some LegUp files including:

Ram.cpp

Ram.h

GenerateRTL.cpp

IterativeModuloScheduling.cpp

LegUp Makefile Changes Required

llvm-ld Deprecated

Use:

llvm-link ...
llvm-opt -std-link-opts ...

instead.

Unfortunately llvm-link cannot link archive files, only .bc files. As a result, instead of linking with liblegup.a, libm.a, etc, we need to link with liblegup.bc, libm.bc, etc, which are basically the same thing, just in a different format.

llvm-gcc Deprecated

llvm-gcc was used for OpenMP support.
The LLVM project “dragonegg” can be used instead.
dragonegg is a gcc plugin.
It will be compiled along with the rest of LegUp.
It requires gcc 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, or 4.8, and the corresponding gcc-4.X-plugin-dev package (available using apt-get).
The main LegUp Makefile assumes the packages gcc-4.6 and gcc-4.6-plugin-dev are installed.
If you wish to use a different version of gcc, you must change the DRAGONEGG variable in legup/examples/Makefile.config and DRAGONEGG_GCC_VERSION in legup/Makefile and recompile LegUp.

LLVM Profiling Deprecated

Vectorization

LLVM 3.4 now produces vectorized code that is not currently supported by LegUp.
Adding clang flags -fno-vectorize and -fno-spl-vectorize seems to solve this problem for now.
In the future it may be desirable to add this functionality to LegUp in order to obtain more parallel hardware.
See LLVM 3.4 Auto-Vectorization for more info.

MIPS1 Target Deprecated

llc no longer has a backend for mips1. Compiling for mips32 with flags -mno-ldc1-sdc1 -soft-float produces somewhat similar code, but it is still not perfect. An awk command can be used to lower conditional move instructions, and add a nop after each lw. Also, the LLVM mips backend was modified to not produce DSP instructions. This seems to work well enough that the mips binutils can assemble working binaries for Tiger.

Changes Required to LegUp Examples

Disable LegUp Features

It was necessary to disable LOCAL_RAMS for the following benchmarks:

chstone/blowfish

chstone/gsm

It was necessary to disable GROUP_RAMS_SIMPLE_OFFSET for the following benchmarks:

chstone/jpeg

Other

chstone_hybrid/dfsin: the linker complains about multiple definitions of 'sin' when linking with libm.bc. sin() was renamed to dfsin() to fix this problem.

"Direct Bindings and Interposition

Interposition can occur when multiple instances of a symbol, having the same
name, exist in different dynamic objects that have been loaded into a process.
Under the default search model, symbol references are bound to the first
definition that is found in the series of dependencies that have been loaded.
This first symbol is said to interpose on the other symbols of
the same name.

Direct bindings can circumvent any implicit interposition. As the directly bound reference
is searched for in the dependency associated with the reference, the default
symbol search model that enables interposition, is bypassed. In a directly bound environment,
bindings can be established to different definitions of a symbol that have
the same name.

The ability to bind to different definitions of a symbol that have
the same name is a feature of direct binding that can be
very useful. However, should an application depend upon an instance of interposition, the
use of direct bindings can subvert the applications expected execution. Before deciding
to use direct bindings with an existing application, the application should be
analyzed to determine whether interposition exists.

To determine whether interposition is possible within an application, use lari(1). By
default, lari conveys interesting information. This information originates from multiple instances of
a symbol definition, which in turn can lead to interposition.

Interposition only occurs when one instance of the symbol is bound to.
Multiple instances of a symbol that are called out by lari might
not be involved in interposition. Other multiple instance symbols can exist, but might
not be referenced. These unreferenced symbols are still candidates for interposition, as
future code development might result in references to these symbols. All instances of
multiply defined symbols should be analyzed when considering the use of direct
bindings.

If multiple instances of a symbol of the same name exist, especially
if interposition is observed, one of the following actions should be performed.

Localize symbol instances to remove namespace collision.

Remove the multiple instances to leave one symbol definition.

Define any interposition requirement explicitly.

Identify symbols that can be interposed upon to prevent the symbol from being directly bound to.

The following sections explore these actions in greater detail.

Localizing Symbol Instances

Multiply defined symbols of the same name that provide different implementations, should
be isolated to avoid accidental interposition. The simplest way to remove a
symbol from the interfaces that are exported by an object, is to reduce
the symbol to local. Demoting a symbol to local can be achieved
by defining the symbol “static”, or possibly through the use of symbol attributes
provided by the compilers.

A symbol can also be reduced to local by using the link-editor
and a mapfile. The following example shows a mapfile that reduces the
global function error() to a local symbol by using the local scoping
directive.

Although individual symbols can be reduced to locals using explicit mapfile definitions,
defining the entire interface family through symbol versioning is recommended. See Chapter 5, Interfaces and Versioning.

Versioning is a useful technique typically employed to identify the interfaces that
are exported from shared objects. Similarly, dynamic executables can be versioned to
define their exported interfaces. A dynamic executable need only export the interfaces that
must be made available for the dependencies of the object to bind
to. Frequently, the code that you add to a dynamic executable need export
no interfaces.

The removal of exported interfaces from a dynamic executable should take into
account any symbol definitions that have been established by the compiler drivers.
These definitions originate from auxiliary files that the compiler drivers add to the
final link-edit. See Using a Compiler Driver.

The following example mapfile exports a common set of symbol definitions that
a compiler driver might establish, while demoting all other global definitions to
local.

You should determine the symbol definitions that your compiler driver establishes. Any
of these definitions that are used within the dynamic executable should remain
global.

By removing any exported interfaces from a dynamic executable, the executable is
protected from future interposition issues than might occur as the objects dependencies
evolve.

Removing Multiply Defined Symbols of the Same Name

Multiply defined symbols of the same name can be problematic within a
directly bound environment, if the implementation associated with the symbol maintains state.
Data symbols are the typical offenders in this regard, however functions that maintain
state can also be problematic.

In a directly bound environment, multiple instances of the same symbol can
be bound to. Therefore, different binding instances can manipulate different state variables
that were originally intended to be a single instance within a process.

For example, suppose that two shared objects contain the same data item
errval. Suppose also, that two functions action() and inspect(), exist in different shared
objects. These functions expect to write and read the value errval respectively.

With the default search model, one definition of errval would interpose on
the other definition. Both functions action() and inspect() would be bound to the
same instance of errval. Therefore, if an error code was written to
errval by action(), then inspect() could read, and act upon this error condition.

However, suppose the objects containing action() and inspect() were bound to different
dependencies that each defined errval. Within a directly bound environment, these functions are
bound to different definitions of errval. An error code can be written
to one instance of errval by action() while inspect() reads the other,
uninitialized definition of errval. The outcome is that inspect() detects no
error condition to act upon.

Multiple instances of data symbols typically occur when the symbols are declared
in headers.

int bar;

This data declaration results in a data item being produced by each
compilation unit that includes the header. The resulting tentative data item can
result in multiple instances of the symbol being defined in different dynamic objects.

However, by explicitly defining the data item as external, references to the
data item are produced for each compilation unit that includes the header.

extern int bar;

These references can then be resolved to one data instance at runtime.

Occasionally, the interface for a symbol implementation that you want to remove, should
be preserved. Multiple instances of the same interface can be vectored to
one implementation, while preserving any existing interface. This model can be achieved by
creating individual symbol filters by using a FILTERmapfile keyword. This keyword
is described in SYMBOL_SCOPE / SYMBOL_VERSION Directives.

Creating individual symbol filters is useful when dependencies expect to find a
symbol in an object where the implementation for that symbol has been
removed.

For example, suppose the function error() exists in two shared objects, A.so.1
and B.so.1. To remove the symbol duplication, you want to remove the implementation
from A.so.1. However, other dependencies are relying on error() being provided from
A.so.1. The following example shows the definition of error() in A.so.1. A mapfile
is then used to allow the removal of the error() implementation, while leaving
a filter for this symbol that is directed to B.so.1.

The function error() is global, and remains an exported interface of A.so.2.
However, any runtime binding to this symbol is vectored to the filtee
B.so.1. The letter “F” indicates the filter nature of this symbol.

This model of preserving existing interfaces, while vectoring to one implementation has
been used in several Oracle Solaris libraries. For example, a number of
math interfaces that were once defined in libc.so.1 are now vectored to the
preferred implementation of the functions in libm.so.2.

Defining Explicit Interposition

The default search model can result in instances of the same named
symbol interposing on later instances of the same name. Even without any explicit
labelling, interposition still occurs, so that one symbol definition is bound to
from all references. This implicit interposition occurs as a consequence of the symbol
search, not because of any explicit instruction the runtime linker has been
given. This implicit interposition can be circumvented by direct bindings.

Although direct bindings work to resolve a symbol reference directly to an
associated symbol definition, explicit interposition is processed prior to any direct binding search.
Therefore, even within a direct binding environment, interposers can be designed, and
be expected to interpose on any direct binding associations. Interposers can be
explicitly defined using the following techniques.

With the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.

With the link-editors -z interpose option.

With the INTERPOSEmapfile keyword.

As a consequence of a singleton symbol definition.

The interposition facilities of the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, and the -z interpose option,
have been available for some time. See Runtime Interposition. As these objects are
explicitly defined to be interposers, the runtime linker inspects these objects before processing
any direct binding.

Interposition that is established for a shared object applies to all the
interfaces of that dynamic object. This object interposition is established when a
object is loaded using the LD_PRELOAD environment variable. Object interposition is also
established when an object that has been built with the -z interpose option,
is loaded. This object model is important when techniques such as dlsym(3C) with
the special handle RTLD_NEXT are used. An interposing object should always have
a consistent view of the next object.

A dynamic executable has additional flexibility, in that the executable can define individual
interposing symbols using the INTERPOSEmapfile keyword. Because a dynamic executable is
the first object loaded in a process, the executables view of the next
object is always consistent.

The following example shows an application that explicitly wants to interpose on
the exit() function.

The letter “I” indicates the interposing nature of this symbol. Presumably, the
implementation of this exit() function directly references the system function _exit(), or
calls through to the system function exit() using dlsym() with the RTLD_NEXT handle.

At first, you might consider identifying this object using the -z interpose option.
However, this technique is rather heavy weight, because all of the interfaces exported
by the application would act as interposers. A better alternative would be
to localize all of the symbols provided by the application except for
the interposer, together with using the -z interpose option.

However, use of the INTERPOSEmapfile keyword provides greater flexibility. The use of
this keyword allows an application to export several interfaces while selecting those
interfaces that should act as interposers.

Symbols that are assigned the STV_SINGLETON visibility effectively provide a form of interposition.
See Table 12-20. These symbols can be assigned by the compilation system to
an implementation that might become multiply instantiated in a number of objects within
a process. All references to a singleton symbol are bound to the
first occurrence of a singleton symbol within a process.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

In the opening scene, the existential hero simply named the Driver (Ryan
O'Neal) stole a prospective client's 4-door Mercedes V-8 Sedan and then
auditioned his skills. He showed the three terrified bad guys how talented
he was as a freelance, ace getaway driver/wheelman for bank heists.

He
plowed through a cramped, underground parking garage and narrow alleyways
in LA to demonstrate his prowess and prove that he was worth every
penny of his high-priced fee.

The film had three spectacular car
chase sequences as well (including a night-time chase through LA).

Hooper (1978)

In a film filled with stunts and daredevil challenges, a car driven by
stuntman Sonny Hooper (Burt Reynolds) drove through a collapsing factory
(and barely missed its falling chimney) and made a rocket-propelled leap
over a 456' chasm over a river where a bridge used to be before it collapsed.

In the final hour of this 11th James Bond film, agent 007 (Roger Moore) ventured to the Amazonian jungle in Brazil, where he was pursued in his armored Glastron Hydrofoil Speedboat on the Tapirape River by henchman sent by villainous billionaire industrialist Hugo Drax (Michael Lonsdale). They launched an armed attack on his craft with explosive depth charges. From the rear of his boat, Bond deployed mines, blowing up one boat and killing three thugs.

As he raced forward, two other boats joined in the
pursuit - one held steel-toothed Jaws (Richard Kiel) who was wielding
a machine-gun. Bond then launched torpedoes from his speedboat,
and destroyed a second boat with three men onboard.

When Bond's
speedboat approached the massive Iguacu Falls, he escaped death
when he launched himself from his speedboat onto a hang glider
that was deployed from the craft's roof - and he soared away to
safety. Jaws (with two other thugs) in the last boat crashed over
the falls.

The Blues Brothers (1980)

Cool
ex-con, renegade musicians named the Blues Brothers - who were ""on
a mission from God"" - were siblings, who both wore black
suits, hats, and shades:

Joliet ""Jake"" Blues
(John Belushi)

Elwood Blues (Dan Aykroyd)

In one of the comedy film's earlier scenes,
there was an incredible jump over an open drawbridge [the 95th
Street bridge] (""This car's got some
pickup""), then a spectacular chase through an entire indoor shopping
mall in the Chicago area [the former Dixie Square Mall] - when they
were pursued by state police in their Bluesmobile (a converted 1974
Dodge Monaco police cruiser sedan), with dozens of crashes through
store windows (J. C. Penney's, Toys R Us, etc.) - that sent shoppers
fleeing.

In the last half
hour of the film, they sped 106 miles in their car toward downtown
Chicago while pursued by lots of squad cars, with a maniacal death-defying
chase that reportedly had the largest number of car crashes (demolition
derby style) in film history. One police car ended up crashing into
the side of a freight truck (""We're in a truck!"").

At the conclusion, the two - driving at 120 mph at
times - plowed their vehicle through a flock of pigeons and a crowd
of pedestrians and into the lobby of the Richard J. Daley Center
municipal building at Daley Plaza. Once they had reached their final
destination, their car literally collapsed and completely fell apart
after they stepped out of it.

[Mack Sennett's The Keystone Kops short films were an inspiration
for this film.]

The Cannonball Run (1981)

Here was another chase film from Hal Needham (similar to his earlier The Gumball
Rally (1976)), featuring a cross-country, car-crashing road-race from
Connecticut to Southern California with the tagline: ""You'll never
guess who wins.""",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

On the Question of Liu Shao-chi

The Belgian journal, La Voix du Peuple, has given considerable attention of late to a speech by Sidney Rittenberg, an American who has lived in China for more than 20 years. An extremely long article purporting to be a criticism of the Rittenburg lecture has extended over a number of issues during November, December and January. Criticism of Rittenburg is the stated aim but the authors appear to have a much more sinister objective in mind.

Rittenburg spoke to a Peking meeting sponsored by a group known as the “Bethune-Yenan Rebel Regiment”, apparently composed in the main of foreign experts working in China. This event took place in April 1967 and the address was subsequently mineographed and distributed abroad in Belgium (in French) and in England ( in English), under the title “Liu Shao-ehi and His Evil Book”. Copies of the speech together with articles attacking its main content have been received in Canada and we propose to comment on the lengthy polemic which appeared in La Voix du Peuple.

While we might be disposed to be somewhat critical of Rittenburg’s speech for being poorly constructed, not too carefully prepared and containing some careless formulatons, we are in agreement with its basic content in criticizing and repudiating the bourgeois-reactionary line of Liu Shao-chi and upholding the proletarian-revolutionary line of Mao Tse-tung. However, the Belgian trio of Jacques Grippa, Rene Raindorf and Stephen Strulens who are of the opposite opinion, in reply to Rittenburg’s 40 to 50 minute speech inscribed a, reply that would fill a good-sized book.

The extreme length of this literary attack is largely caused by the authors’ ranging far beyond the limits of the Rittenburg speech which did not provide them with sufficient scope for the objective they had in mind. In order to correct this situaton Rittenburg is charged with not saying certain things, and the things which were not said provide the main basis for the attack. The authors list a total of ten so-called “omissions” in the speech:

“ . .. no denunciation of American fascist imperialism”; “... no analysis of the social base of social-democratic reformism and revisionism”; “... no analysis of the contradictions in the contemporary world or the role of fundamental contradiction”; “nothing about revolutionary movements for national liberation”; “no reference to the contradictions between imperalists and revisionists on the one hand and socialist countries on the other hand”; “no allusion to the new stage of working class struggle ... in imperialist countries”; “nothing ... on the subject of contradictions between the capitalists and between the imperalists”; “no reminder of the essential nature of our period as Lenin and other Marxist-Leninists have defined it”; “nothing . . . which recalls that this is a period during which imperialism will be destroyed and the proletarian revolution victorious”; “These ’omissions’ suggest strange conclusions about the real world ...”

If these alleged “omissions” had been discussed, several days would have been added to a 50 minute speech. But let us leave it to the authors themselves to make reply to their charges of “omissions”. In part four of their literary marathon, having ’forgotten what they had written several weeks previous, the authors, criticizing Rittenburg, unwittingly supplied their own answer to the false cry of ’omissions”; as follows:

“It is also necessary to refute the false argument that is purely and simply a diversion and consists of saying that How to be a Good Communist does not deal with such and such a question. With that reasoning no Marxist-Leninist work except a complete encyclopedia would be of any value.”

That is fitting enough reply – nothing need be added.

However, we did not take up the pen to defend Rittenberg; the relentless attack on his speech is but the prologue to the real aim of his detractors – a covert attack on Chairman Mao Tse-tung and the Proletarian Cultural Revoluton in China, an attack masked by vehement declarations of loyalty to Marxist-Leninist principles and with loud cries of “long live Mao Tse-tung.” But not every shouter of slogans is a Marxist-Leninist and the lengthy article in La Voix du Peuple is a prime example of that point. In part 2 of the article we read:

“...the Marxist-Leninists of the world have always contributed new jewels to the common treasure of Marxist-Leninist thought, as Mao Tse-tung has done so brilliantly in many areas.”

We have no desire to disparge the contributions of many working-class journalists around the world, (including our own modest effort), who work under difficult and trying circumstances. But we cannot agree that the vast and important contributions to Marxist-Leninist theory and practice made by the chief architect and leader of the Chinese Revolution are to be considered in the same light, for what the authors imply here is that Mao Tse-tung is just another contributor instead of presenting him in the proper light as the equal of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, the one who advances the work begun by these brilliant minds. Mao Tse-tung has brilliantly applied and developed Marxism-Leninism in the era of the final defeat of imperialism and of victorious proletarian revolution, and particularly in solving the problem of how to carry on the proletarian revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat – a task which Marx, Lenin, and Engels could not, and did not carry out.

To downgrade the great contribution of Mao Tse-tung as la Voix du Peuple does means denying the authority of Marxist-Leninist thought in our day, it means lowering the banner of revolution. The thought of Mao Tse-tung is not just one more of many contributions, it IS Marxism-Leninism in our time and upholding Marxism-Leninism, defending the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship requires that revolutionaries uphold and defend the authority of the thought of Mao Tse-tung. The above-quoted passage fails in this respect – it lowers the banner of the thought of Mao Tse-tung, hence it lowers the banner of proletaian revolution in the world.

The “Center” of Revolution

When representatives of the Progressive Workers Movement returned from a trip to China last year, they stated:

The outcome of the struggle now taking place will determine the future destiny of China and will exercise a decisive influence on the whole world because, as far as the present era is concerned, it is China that plays the really decisive role in the world. It is China that is the decisive factor so far as revolution, not only in China but in the world, is concerned. We can say with confidence there will be hope in the world so long as China does not fall and does not change its colour. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an event of vast importance which has a vital bearing on the destiny of the whole of mankind (Progressive Worker, Vol.3, No.9, July, 1967).

The passage of time and events have not caused us to alter our opinion. On the contrary, we are now more firmly convinced that the consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship and winning new victories in the Cultural Revolution in China constitute objectives that are of supreme importance to the cause of the anti-imperialist struggle and the world revolution. From the contents of the article in la Voix du Peuple it appears that Grippa, Raindorf and Streulens are far from agreeing with us.

Rittenberg, after commenting on the revisionist seizure of power in the Soviet Union, went on to say:

Was that going to happen in China? Were they going to take down the picture of Chairman Mao that hangs over the Tien An Men gate tower one day? Were they going to announce that China would not be the center of world revolution, that China will cease and desist from giving unstinted aid to the embattled peoples of all countries, particularly of Asia, Africa and Latin America in return for false assurances of peace and moderation from the imperialists.

Taking a distorted version of this passage as their point la Voix du Peuple presents an argument that conveys the impression that the defeat of the Chinese Revolution would be but a minor tragedy. Here, in part, is la Voix du Peuple rebuttal to Rittenberg:

For us Marxist-Leninists, the Soviet Union was for a long time the only socialist country, the only one where the victorious proletarian revolution showed the way...and constituted a powerful force for the proletarian world revolution...

When the revisionists usurped power in the U.S.S.R., we were not for long disoriented and discouraged – we did not feel we had lost our ’center’. We considered this setback, this temporary defeat of the Russian Revolution, just as a setback, a check for ourselves and for the world revolution, a regrettable mishap for class struggle on a world scale, but we preserved intact our fighting will...

When the Chinese revolution was victorious and the People’s Republic of China was proclaimed we saluted that victory, considered it as our own... (Part 3).

Ignoring for the moment the all-too-casual way in which the Russian Revolution is written off, and the very low estimate of the extent of that defeat, let us examine its meaning as it applies to China for it is the very obvious intention of la Voix du Peuple that it is intended to convey their opinion of a possible defeat in China. According to these writers, then, the downfall of the Chinese Revolution would be “just a setback”, a “check”, a “regrettable mishap for the class struggle” that would make no substantial difference to the world Marxist-Leninist movement and the anti-imperialist struggle. Apparently we can depend on the editors of La Voix du Peuple to “preserve intact their fighting will”, step into the breach and challenge international reaction led by U.S. imperialism and aided by Soviet revisionism. With all due respect to La Voix du Peuple we simply cannot buy their theory. For us the Chinese revolution is a subject of outstanding importance the defeat of which could never be written off as a “regrettable mishap.” Certainly struggle would go on. It is inevitable that struggle will continue, but under what vastly altered and unfavourable circumstances!

It would take nothing away from the outstanding heroism of the Vietnamese people, nor would we be underestimating their brilliant application of, and contribution to the strategy and tactics of peoples war, to say that, without revolutionary China as their firm and reliable rear, their struggle would be infinitely more difficult, if not impossibe in its present highly-developed form. Without China, Soviet revisionist and treachery pressure to yield imperialist blackmail would go unchallenged.

It is not without significance that it is in Southeast Asia where the Chinese revolution has the greastest influence, and not in the Middle East or Latin America, that U.S. imperialism is meeting its most formidable challenge just now. Are we not justified in believing that had China fallen to the revisionists the anti-imperialist struggle in Vietnam and elsewhere would not now be in its present highly-developed form? If that diaster had occured the counter-revolutionary policy of peaceful co-existence with the imperialists, and not that of the revolutionary anti-imperialist peoples war, would be the dominant characteristic in the world in this period. Should we, then accept the opinion that this would be only a “regrettable mishap.”

We cannot accept the way in which La Voix du Peuple presents the sequence of events quoted above. It happens that the Russian revolution suffered a “regrettable mishap” following which the courageous editors of the Belgium journal “preserved intact their fighting will, the determination to struggle”, then, happily, along came the Chinese Revolution which the editors “claimed as their own.”

We have not such short memories. We will remember that the Chinese revolution was victorious for some seven years before the outright seizure of power by the Kruschovites and that it was the Chinese Party that was in the lead in exposing that betrayal by the revisionists. We know that it was still another seven years, in 1963, before Grippa and his colleagues effected an organizational break with the revisionists in Belgium. Had there been no Red China to stand against and expose revisionist treachery the struggle to build a Marxist-Leninist movement would have been more difficult.

In his preface to the second edition of The Peasant in Germany Engels said of the German workers:

“If the German workers proceed in this way, they not march exactly at the head of the movement – it is not in the interests of the movement that the workers of one country should march at the head of all – but they will occupy an honourable place on the battle line, and they will stand armed for battle when other unexpected grave trials or momentuous events will demand heightened courage heightened determination, and the will to act”, and further on in the preface, they “form the vanguard of the proletarian struggle.”

What could be said of the German workers a century ago, without state power in their confrontation with reaction is a thousand times more applicable to China today. The working people of China certainly occupy an honourable place in the battle line, and those who have been privileged to see China in these days of victory in the Cultural Revolution know that the Chinese people, mobilized around the revolutionary banner of Mao Tse-tung, stand armed for battle when grave trials or momentuous events demand heightened courgae.

The Book of Liu Shao-chi

The true extent of La Voix du Peuple becomes clear in Part 4 which appeared in the issue of December 1st. Rittenberg’s speech is but the means to an end, that end being defence of the book by Liu Shao-chi. This fact is established in the very first phrase when Rittenberg’s criticism of How to be a Good Communis is referred to as “vituperations against the book by Liu Shao-chi”. This categorical rejection of any criticism of the book is made still clearer later when Rittenberg’s critical remarks are classed as, “frantic attacks against Marxist-Leninist parties”, “a peridious campaign against Marxism-Leninism”, “an anti Marxist-Leninist counter-revolutionary line”, etc. Repudiation of the line of Liu Shao-chi is discribed as an “invention of Rittenberg and his masters” used with the “intention of destroying Marxist-Leninist parties by any means.”

La Voix du Peuple makes numerous allusions to “Rittenberg, his masters and agents” with the obvious intention of having all criticism of Liu Shao-chi and his book automatically associated with an alleged international counter-revolutionary conspiracy. In this way the authors of the article strive to suppress criticism of the line of Liu Shao-chi and, at the same time, give their actions the appearance of defending Marxism-Leninism. If Rittenberg does have “masters and agents” they must total in the hundreds of millions – presently engaged in sharp criticism and repudiation of the line of Liu Shao-chi. This repudiation of Liu Shao-chi and his book is an important part of the Cultural Revolution, and a fact which cannot help but be known to La Voix du Peuple.

One of the authors, Stephen Strulens, arrived in China last spring apparently there to discuss some questions in connection with the Rittenberg speech. We met Strulens and his companion at the Shanghai Airport and spent several hours with them there. We were with them when airport workers gave a concert featuring the thought of Mao Tse-tung by means of song and dance – one encounters these impromptu concerts all over China. Propaganda teams of the thought of Mao Tse-tung can be found in all corners of the land and they number in the millions. In unison with the working masses of China these teams raise the cry “Down with Liu Shao-chi and his evil book.” Strulens witnessed this phenomena at Shanghai and when we saw him again on our return to Peking we know he could not fail to see millions of workers repeating the slogan in the great square at Tien An Men, not far from the Hotel Peking.

Strulens, therefore, could not fail to observe that “Down with Liu Shao-chi and the capitalist roaders” was the demand of millions and not a plot devised by a small band of counter-revolutionary conspirators. Strulens must have communicated this fact to his colleagues. What purpose do they have, then, in attempting to have this appear as an “invention of Rittenberg, his masters and his agents”? They can have only one aim in view – rehabilitation of the bourgeois-reactionary line of Liu Shao-chi as sumanzed in his book How to be a Communist

La Voix du Peuple gives an edited and abbreviated version of the following passage from Rittenberg’s speech: “ the poison smuggled into the Communist movement by Liu Shao-chi and the representatives of his line, particularly reflected in his book, must be eradicated, not only in China, but throughout the revolutionary movement. Otherwise, it will be impossible to really establish a proletarian revolutionary line and carry the revolution forward to victory.”

Responding to this la Voix du Peuple says: “Rittenberg his masters and agents have thrown their ultimate to Marxist-Leninist: those who do not yell ’Down with Liu Shao-chi and his book How to be a Good Communist’ become ’false revolutionaries,’ ’revisionists,’ ’counter revolutionaries.’”

This type of ’reply’ only amounts to an evasion of the real point at issue by a resort to invective. If Rittenberg is justified in his criticism of the book – and we agree he is – then those who do not join in repudiating it are false revolutionaries and revisionists, and resorting to invective connot erase that fact. Again it is evident La Voix du Peuple is anxious to defend Liu Shao-chi by any avaible means. Following the above passage the editors express righteous indignation over an “order” said to have come from Ritenberg: “... at their order, our Party is supposed to serviley reject, totally, on the spot, with no discussion, a book which for all this time has been considered good...”

There is no part of Rittenberg’s speech which could possibly be interpreted as an order to servilely reject anything. As for “no discussion”, the editors of la Voix du Peuple must surely know that Liu Shao-chi and his book have been important items for discussion for many months and that numerous articles and pamphlets on the subject have been published in many languages. If there has been no discussion of this question in Belgium then the fault rests with the Belgian movement for failing to read, study, and discuss the wealth of material and information available. And if there has been no discussion, as the above quotation clearly indicates, on what did la Voix du Peuple base their decision to reject Rittenberg’s thesis and defend the book by Liu Shao-chi? It seems they have decided to accept the line of Liu Shao-chi “with no discussion”.

That the authors of the article in la Voix du Peuple do defend How to be a Good Communist is not in doubt as the following passage form Part 4 will demonstrate:

Rittenberg condemns How to be a Good Communist because it mentions nowhere the problem of taking revolutionary power.

This is not true. Not only does the whole book deal with the education of the Communist Party, of the cadre in the revolutionary struggle, thus implying the necessity of the taking of power by the proletariat allied to the other classes of the labouring population, that is to say the dictatorship of the proletariat, but also deals explicitly with the fundamental question of power, in relation to the deportment of Communists.

It is significant that the authors are unable to quote Liu Shao-chi DIRECTLY on the dictatorship of the proletariat, but, in giving the lie to Rittenberg, are limited to making the unsubstantiated claim that Liu Shao-chi IMPLIES the necessity of taking power, which can be considered as no more than an opinion of the editors, and a very unreliable one at that. The truth is that How to be a Good Communist, first published in China in 1939, and revised and republished many times thereafter until 1962, maintains total silence on the proletarian dictatorship. (First published in the fierce struggle of the anti-Japanese war, it never once touched upon that conflict until the 1962 edition, long after the war, when a brief reference to it was thrown in). Liu Shao-chi simply describes the state as “centralized and at the same time democratic” and nowhere mentions the necessity for dictatorship over the class enemy. What is that but the Kruschovite “state of the whole people”?

However it is not necessary for us to enter into an endless debate over this question of implicit or explicit references to proletarian power for it is easy to establish the fact that Liu Shao-chi not only does not mention the subject but actually eliminates all references to it in every one of the many editions issued since 1939.

In 1962 – the year of the most recent edition (English edition 1964) – the question of proletarian power was under sharp attack from the revisionists led by the Soviet ruling clique, therefore Marxist-Leninists were duty-bound to rise in defence of this concept which is central to Marxism-Leninism. Yet Liu Shao-chi continued to erase it from his book.

On pages 40 and 41 (1961 English edition) Liu Shao-chi cites two passages from Left-Wing Communism by Lenin but he eliminates important sections from the body of each quotation. In the quotation on Page 40 the following section is excluded:

The dictatorship of the proletariat is a persistent struggle – bloody and bloodless, violent and peaceful, military and economic, educational and administrative – against the forces and traditions of the old society... Without an iron party tempered in the struggle, without a party enjoying the confidence of all that is honest in the given class, without a party capable of watching and influencing the mood of the masses, it is impossible to conduct such a struggle successfully.

And on Page 41 we find the following excluded from the quotation from Lenin:

“The dictatorship of the proletariat is essential.”

So we can see clearly that Liu Shao-chi ELIMINATED all references to proletarian dictatorship when he “quoted” from Lenin and made no reference to the subject himself. Was this just an oversight, an accident repeated in each new and revised edition of How to be a Good Communist? How could any Marxist-Leninist possibly overlook the all-important question of proletarian power? It is not Rittenberg but the editors of la Voix du Peuple who are wrong about Liu Shao-chi failing to deal with the dictatorship of the proletariat. And in view of the charge by la Voix du Peuple that “Rittenberg and his masters” are trying to destroy the Marxist-Leninist movement it is significant that Liu Shao-chi erases Lenin’s reference to the type of party required UNDER THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT.

The Belgian article states: “Engels, Lenin and Stalin ought to disappear according to Rittenberg”. This is to our way of thinking a completely unjustified accusation, all the more slanderous in view of the failure to point out how Liu Shao-chi did, in fact, cause Engels and Stalin to disappear.

In all the editions of his book until 1962 Liu Shao-chi wrote: “be the best pupils of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin” and quoted three passages from Chapter Four of the History of the CPSU. But in nineteen-sixty-two, he revised this to read: “Be worthy pupils of Marx and Lenin” and deleted entirely the passages previously quoted from the History of the CPSU. To do this in nineteen-sixty-two could only mean conforming to the wishes and needs of the Soviet revisionists who attacked Stalin to destroy Marxism-Leninism. In order to delete the name of Stalin he made Engels a co-victim with him.

For us the evidence seems clear and irrefutable: Liu Shao-chi opposes proletarian dictatorship and the party of a revolutionary type which Lenin fought for and Mao Tse-tung did so much to build in China.

In Conclusion

We have not exhausted the subject of Liu Shao-chi whose activities range well beyond those dealt with here. There is a lot of material available which can be obtained from Advance Books and Periodicals, Neither have we dealt completely with the lengthy article in la Voix du Peuple. We feel however, that we are justified in drawing the conclusion that the editors of la Voix du Peuple are committed to defending the bourgeois-reactioary line of Liu Shao-chi and are intent on making it appear that criticism of Liu Shao-chi is an attack on the Communist Party and the thought of Mao Tse-tung. But these two are representatives of two fundamentally different lines which cannot be reconciled. Liu Shao-chi represents the counter-revolutionory line of the bourgeois while Mao Tse-tung represents the proletarian revolutionary line. One must choose between these two. The Central Committee and the vast majority of cadres and Party members, together with the Chinese masses, guided by the thought of Chairman Mao, are criticizing and repudiating the reactionary line of Liu Shao-chi who is the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road.

The speech by Rittenberg, as we have noted above, might justifiably be criticized for its style and some careless formulations. But this is not what the editors of la Voix du Peuple are concerned with. On the basic point of repudiating Liu Shao-chi and defending Mao Tse-tung Rittenberg is correct. But it is precisely against this correct point that the attack is directed. It is clear that the authors, behind the screen of a pretended attack on Rittenberg, are in reality mounting an attack on Mao Tse-tung and the Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We firmly state our opposition to the line advanced by La Voix du Peuple, which we consider to be pointing a revisionist course and, in essence, counter-revolutionary. We take our stand now, as always, on the side of Chair Mao Tse-tung and China’s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The direct line to Brown University students and the Brown way of life: brought to you by Brown University Admissions Office

From Albania to Zimbabwe: My Very First Halloweekend

Hi there! My name is Akira Camargo, a freshman hailing from Tokyo, Japan who will try to crack funny jokes and puns from time to time as I write posts for From Albania to Zimbabwe, the ins and outs of being at Brown from an international student’s perspective. Through my posts, you’ll be able to learn more about all things international here, ranging from international events at Brown (cool guest speakers, festivals and parties) to my thoughts on living in America for the first time (!!!), and a bunch of other interesting stuff as my first year at Brown unfolds. Hope you enjoy reading them!

Happy November! I hope all of you had a great one. For those of you applying to colleges, the Early Decision deadline just passed…! I congratulate those of you who submitted your first college application! That’s a commendable honor. I remember exactly a year ago, I was in my high school library looking over my Brown application and hitting submit while my friend Sumika (who also got admitted to Brown and is in the above photo on the left) did a last-minute run through of my essays. It’s really weird to think how much my life has changed in just a year. Spooky…

Speaking of spooky, Halloweekend is just making its final run at Brown. I dressed up with all of my friends, had a lot of fun at some awesome Halloween-themed parties and I am now procrastinating from all the work I didn’t do this week.

Anyway, this was my first Halloween in America and in college, and I must say, WOW. I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and passion everyone had with regards to what costume they wanted to wear, what parties to go to and much much more. Back at home, we really didn’t do much for Halloween except for Trick-or-Treating when I was younger, so it was a big change to do a whole set of different things. It was an overwhelming couple of days but I sure did have a lot of fun.

On Friday, I dressed up with my friend as superheroes and went to a party that was hosted by our college neighbor next door, RISD. I met a bunch of cool people and even made a new Japanese friend! The international world is small, and you are bound to find people who you share mutual friends with. Take advantage of your international background!

On Saturday, the Japan Cultural Association had its annual Haunted House, which was tiring and exicting all at the same time. We created our own haunted house, in a series of small classrooms in a basement of an old buildling at Brown. Scary right? It was a great success and I had a lot of fun scaring people (I didn’t think that would be fun, but hey, it really was!).

As an international student, you will definitely experience a lot of ‘firsts’, just like Halloween. Don’t forget to be open-minded and try new things. That being said, no one really pressures you, and it’s also cool to stick to what you’re used to as well.
Stay warm, folks. It just started snowing here and I am freaking out! Winter is coming!

Best,
Akira

Dorothea Benckendorff, Princess Lieven (1784-1857)

Dorothea, Princess Lieven, was born in December, 1784, into the Russian Baltic nobility at Riga, now in Latvia. Her father, General Christopher von Benckendorff, served as military governor of Russia’s Baltic provinces; her mother, Anna Juliane née Schilling von Cannstatt, held a high position at the Russian court as senior lady-in-waiting and best friend of Empress Maria Fyodorovna, the wife of Czar Paul and mother of the Czars Alexander I and Nicholas.

Princess Lieven had two brothers. Count Alexander Benkendorf, four years her senior, was aide-de-camp to the Emperor Nicholas, and at one time Chief of the Secret Police. He died in 1844. Count Constantine Benkendorf was born in the same year as the Princess; he rose to the rank of General
in the Russian service, and died of fever, in 1828, at Pravadi, during the first campaign of the war against Turkey.

Dorothea was educated at the Smolny Convent Institute in St Petersburg and then was assigned as a maid of honour to the Empress Maria. In 1801, at the age of sixteen, some months after finishing her studies, Dorothea married General Count (later Prince) Christopher Lieven.

Princess Lieven had, in all, five sons and one daughter. Two sons, Alexander and Paul, alone survived their parents. Of the younger children, the only daughter died, presumably, in infancy; Arthur and George died at Petersburg, of scarlet fever, in 1835, while Constantine, having incurred his father's displeasure, left his family and died in America in the year 1838.

At the Peace of Tilsit, in 1807, Count Lieven had attained the rank of Lieutenant-General, and in 1810 was accredited to Berlin as Russian Minister Plenipotentiary, at the Court of Frederick-William III. In 1812 Count Lieven was appointed Ambassador in London, and held this post for the following twenty-two years. Dorothea used her intelligence, charisma, and social skills to contribute materially to the success of her husband’s embassy.

In England's political environment, the Princess discovered that she had a flair for politics. By 1814, if not earlier, she was elected as one of the patronesses of Almack's Assembly Rooms, the first foreigner to be so honoured; she is said to have introduced the German Waltz to Almack's. She was a prominent political hostess: invitations to her house were the most sought after. She held the confidence of some of the most important statesmen in London and Europe and she was considered to be at least as politically important, if not more so, than her ambassador husband who, at the time of the coronation of the Emperor Nicholas in September, 1826, received the title of Prince.

The Princess participated, either directly or indirectly, in every major diplomatic event between 1812 and 1857. She knew ‘everyone in the Courts and cabinets for thirty or forty years [and] knew all the secret annals of diplomacy’, wrote a French diplomat. Dorothea devoted herself tirelessly to the welfare of Russia, assiduously sleeping with every major statesman on the European stage, including Metternich, George IV and each successive British prime minister except George Canning, whom she saw as a plebeian with no manners. Her lovers changed with each Cabinet reshuffle.

She performed at least one secret diplomatic mission for the Tsar when, in 1825 Tsar Alexander entrusted Dorothea with a secret overture to the British government. ‘It is a pity Countess Lieven wears skirts’, the Tsar wrote to his foreign minister Count Nesselrode. ‘She would have made an excellent diplomat.’ The Tsar’s mission marked Dorothea Lieven’s debut as a diplomat in her own right.

During Prince Lieven’s ambassadorship in England, (1812-1834) the Princess played a key role in the birth of modern Greece, and made a notable contribution to the creation of today’s Belgium. In London, Princess Lieven cultivated friendships with the foremost statesmen of her day. She and Austrian Chancellor Prince Klemens Lothar Wenzel von Metternich had a notorious liaison. Her friendships with George IV, Prince Metternich, the Duke of Wellington, George Canning, Count Nesselrode, Lord Grey, and François Guizot gave Dorothea Lieven the opportunity to exercise authority in the diplomatic councils of Great Britain, France, and Russia.

In 1834 Prince Lieven was recalled from London, and was named Governor to the young Czarevitch, later Emperor Alexander II. Despite her residence in London, the Princess had already been appointed senior lady-in-waiting to the Empress Alexandra in 1829. Soon after the Lievens returned to Russia, their two youngest sons died suddenly. This tragedy and her declining health caused the Princess to leave her native land and settle in Paris. Though she suffered from ill health in the last decades of her life, she continued to be involved in politics and diplomacy. Her collected letters provide a wickedly gossipy insight into Regency England.

In a city where salons served a unique social and political purpose, Princess Lieven’s Paris salon, known as ‘the listening/observation post of Europe’, empowered her to be an independent stateswoman. In 1837 she and François Guizot entered into a close personal partnership that lasted until the Princess's death.

Dorothea Lieven died peacefully at her home, 2 rue Saint-Florentin, Paris1 on 27 January 1857 . She was buried, according to her wish, at the Lieven family estate, Mežotne near Jelgava, next to her two young sons who had died in St. Petersburg.

The concept “thoughts turn into issues” has turn into a meme in pop culture.

What does the medical proof let us know in regards to the scope of the human brain to remodel ideas into truth?

Yamaha Motif Rack

It seems simple enough — take the successful Motif workstation, remove the keyboard, and release it as a more affordable rack unit. But there's lots more to the Motif Rack than meets the eye...

As the owner of a studio best described as compact and bijou, I have always applauded the practice of repackaging synthesizers and other keyboard instruments into space-saving rack modules — and latterly, zero-mass software! In many cases, it can be some time after the release of the original keyboard version until the rack module makes an appearance — time enough for the manufacturer to gauge the success of the original instrument, and thus infer a viable market for a module. Yamaha claim on their web site that a modular version of the Motif has been their most-requested product — so, one-and-a-half years after the release of the acclaimed Motif 6, 7 and 8 workstations, the Motif Rack is born.

The Motif 7 was reviewed in depth by Derek Johnson and Debbie Poyser in SOS September 2001, so I recommend referring to this for a detailed description of the Motif synthesis engine and other features. The Motif Rack can essentially be described as 'the sound of the Motif in a box' — however, there are some significant functional and feature differences between the keyboard and rack versions.

The Motif Rack is a 1U rack, measuring 35cm in depth. The front silver-and-blue liveried panel hosts the 20 buttons, rotary encoder dial and 160x64 backlit LCD display that control the synth within. A master volume control, headphone socket and power switch complete the line-up. Round the back we find the usual wall-wart power connection and MIDI In/Out/Thru. There are six analogue outputs (a stereo Master plus four assignables), S/PDIF and optical digital outputs as standard, and a USB connector.

Anyone familiar with the numerous controls on the Motif keyboards may be wondering how on earth all of its features can be condensed down to 20 buttons and a dial. Obviously the control faders and knobs of the keyboard are absent, as are the (redundant) master keyboard controls. Two other principal features of the keyboard versions are also missing from the Motif Rack. Firstly, the Motif Rack has no onboard sampling, nor is there any facility for importing samples — hence no internal sample RAM. Secondly, there is no onboard sequencer — the Motif Rack is purely a tone generator. The Motif synth engine has nevertheless not been compromised in any way as a result of these omissions — if anything, it has been given a shot of steroids

The basic Voice structure remains the same — AWM2 (ie. sample-based) waveforms, four AWM2 elements per Voice with subtractive synthesis, each element having ADDSR envelopes for Amp, and HADDSRs for both Filter and Pitch, 20 filter types (six low-pass filters, two high-pass filters, four band-pass filters, one notch filter — or band-elimination filter, as it is called here — and seven dual filters) and one LFO. The major enhancement here is a polyphony of 128 voices, as opposed to the Motif's 62. The effects have also been upgraded to Business Class; the Global effects now boast eight new reverb algorithms (totalling 20) and there are 44 chorus options, which include a selection of 25 reverb/delays and 19 chorus-type effects (see the 'Rack Vs Keyboard Versions' box below). The two Insert effects have also had a makeover — each Insert now has a range of 107 effects to choose from, whereas the Motif had 25 for Insert 1 and 104 for Insert 2. The number of Preset Voices has been upped from three banks to five — each with 128 Presets, totalling 640. There are now two user-programmable banks of 128 instead of one, and even the outputs have been augmented to a total of six — one master stereo pair and four assignables.

Due to the absence of an onboard sequencer, the Motif Keyboards' Performance and sequencer Song modes are now represented on the Motif Rack by a Multi mode. This actually handles both of the latter modes in one. You can either dial up a Multi directly from the User bank, or you can access a preset 'library' of Multis. On the review model, this library contains 124 configurations, arranged into two Banks. Bank 1 consists of 59 Performance-type Multis — ie. up to four velocity and keyrange-scaleable parts, all receiving on one fixed MIDI channel, thus making complex layered sounds, some with a drum groove at the lower end of the keyboard overlapping with a pad in the middle and a lead sound at the top. Bank 2 contains 65 Multi-type presets, or 16-part multitimbral configurations, for use with a sequencer. Setups for a variety of musical genres are available here; if you wish, you can simply select the library preset closest to your requirements, then copy it to the temporary buffer. From here you can edit it out of all recognition if you desire, then save it to the Multi User bank.

The Arpeggiator remains basically the same as on the original Motif, save for the absence of a User bank — so no bespoke patterns can be created. Nevertheless, fans of Philip Glass will have a whale of a time with the 256 patterns on offer — especially the chordal types. There are various ways to manipulate the patterns; notes can be sorted in the order in which they are played, key velocity can be acknowledged or ignored, and key and velocity ranges can be set. The velocity range is especially useful — if you set the arpeggiator to engage above a certain point, say velocity 120, then any notes played below that threshold will play the voice as normal. In this way you could play an acoustic guitar melody, then hit a chord hard for an instant flamenco flourish — olé! Unlike the Motif, the Motif Rack transmits its arpeggiations from the MIDI Out port, enabling you to arpeggiate any external synth, or to record the arpeggios into a sequencer. My only wish would be that you could have more than one instance of the arpeggiator in a Multi — unfortunately it can only be assigned to one Part, but this is exactly when the ability to record the arpeggio's output to a sequencer should come in very handy indeed.

Although the Motif Rack lacks the sampler functions of the keyboard Motifs, it still retains the option to install plug-in boards from Yamaha's PLG range. These plug-ins offer different types of synthesis — analogue modelling, FM and acoustic physical modelling, for example. Not only do they add a complete new instrument to the Motif Rack, they also add their own polyphony and effects — meaning the Motif Rack's own engine is augmented, not compromised. See the 'Plug-In Boards' box for a list of the boards currently suitable for the Motif Rack. Whereas the keyboard Motifs can accommodate three such plug-in boards, the Motif Rack can only take two, due to the obvious size restrictions. The Presets for these boards are already in the Motif Rack's OS, so the sounds are ready to roll from the moment you install a board.

The Motif Rack ships with a CD containing audio demos of the PLG plug-ins, plus various application softwares. As well as the requisite Yamaha USB drivers, there are various voice editors — Voice Editor for Motif Rack, editors for each of the PLG plug-ins, and a sequencer, SQ01. Of these, the voice editor and SQ01 sequencer are of particular interest here. The Motif Rack's 160x64 display and 20 buttons, while not too painfully minimalist, are about as economical as they could be without being obstructive. The software editor therefore comes as a welcome bonus, and it was a simple matter to install the USB drivers and software. The voice editor is well-thought-out and very intuitive, making deep-level voice-editing of Motif Rack sounds a relative doddle. Sadly you cannot edit Multis in this program, which means you must endure a certain amount of cursoring and dialling. Nevertheless, you can download the entire voice contents of the Motif Rack to your computer, edit and rearrange the voices, save them, edit effects and so on. There's also an integral librarian function, so all your sounds can be archived to your hard drive.

SQ01 deserves a special mention too — it is a fully functional MIDI + Audio sequencer, and while it may not exactly be Sonar or Cubase SX, I was surprised at the extent of the facilities it offers for a free program. Certainly it would be a great help for anyone starting out on a limited budget who wants to get into some serious Motif Rack action while waiting for the funds to accrue towards a sequencer upgrade. The bad news is that SQ01 is only available for Windows...

Editing without the software editor can be fairly slow — there's a lot of cursoring to be done, and the rotary dial can sometimes be annoyingly slow when going from one parameter extreme to the other. An Undo facility would help when you're experimenting with values — my dialling finger would certainly agree. Some voice parameters are perhaps not as detailed as on other synths — others more so. For example, each element has only one LFO, with a choice of only three waveforms, and the LFO delay time is combined into one parameter with the fade-in time. By comparison, Roland's XV synth tones have two LFOs, each with 11 waveforms, separate LFO delay and fade, and four fade modes. That said, the Motif Rack voice has 20 filter types as opposed to the Roland's six, not to mention a global Common LFO that enjoys 13 waveforms, and the Motif's amplifier and filter keyboard scaling is blessed with four adjustable breakpoints — very nice — in contrast to the Roland's linear slope.

There are a few other editing issues: there is no means of editing two or more elements simultaneously, and you can't copy the settings of one element to another within the Temp Edit buffer. This is true even when editing from your computer. You can copy elements from already saved voices, but each time you want to copy an element, you have to save the sound you're editing before you've finished, which isn't too sensible. In Multi mode, you can make some basic 'offset' type edits to voices while they are in situ within the Multi, but you don't have access to fully detailed, individual element parameters.

The amount of reverb and chorus applied to a Voice is global — in other words, there is no individual send level for each Voice element. Although up to four Insert effects can be used per Multi, they must have been programmed into the relevant Voices first. While this is not as flexible as on some other synths, the quality of the effects is consistently first class.

One disturbing thing came to light whilst constructing a test multitimbral piece in Sonar — the Motif Rack exhibited some conspicuous timing problems when playing a simple six-part tune. Initially, I thought it was due to the Motif being sluggish to respond over its MIDI ports, but the problem persisted, even when I banished MIDI in favour of the USB port. Loading the same song into SQ01 produced the same timing errors. In order to confirm there was no problem within the sequencers, I copied the drum part to an adjacent track, and routed it to a completely different synth module. This played the drum part back perfectly in time — while the duplicate Motif Rack drum part stumbled conspicuously, and was noticeably late in triggering. In order to get some idea of exactly how much, I recorded an audio snippet of the twin drum parts and inspected the waveform at a high zoom factor. The results showed an average discrepancy of around 1800 samples — ie. 40 milliseconds at 44.1kHz sample rate (the sequence was at 86bpm). Mindful of the fact that sequencers prioritise the scanning of tracks in numerical order (the Motif drums were on track 10, according to their default MIDI channel) I moved both drum tracks to the top of the track list. The problem was slightly ameliorated, but there was still a distinct flamming between the part from the Motif and the one from the other module, more than would otherwise be expected from 'normal' MIDI-timing discrepancies. This time, the delay measured on average 400 samples, which translates into around nine milliseconds — better, but still perceptable. This is a potentially serious problem for a multitimbral synth.

As a performance synth, the Motif Rack is a fine-sounding machine, made all the more attractive by the option to add plug-in synth boards. The sounds it produces cover a vast palette of musical genres, and are well-suited to meet the increasing demand for an all-purpose synth that can tackle pretty much any style of music. However, as a multitimbral workstation module, the Motif Rack fared less well at the time of this review due to the timing problems reported above. Yamaha were made aware of this problem, and at the time of going to press were trying to nail it down and see if it was something that could be resolved with a software upgrade, as opposed to a more serious hardware-based problem. Depending on what they find, UK customers may have the benefit, as the Motif Rack was about to start shipping in the UK when Yamaha found out about the problem, and the release has been delayed at the time of writing. As we went to press, Yamaha had the following to say on the subject: ""To date, we're unaware of any problematic issues relating to Motif Rack, however thanks to the diligence of the Sound On Sound team we're taking steps to fully investigate this situation, and will be able to respond shortly. Unfortunately, because of the deadlines involved with this issue, we cannot make a full statement, but will of course do so before the product ships within the UK market. For any updates and news, please keep an eye on the SOS web site, where you'll be the first to hear the latest.""

I really do like the Motif Rack as a synth, so the altruist in me feels compelled to find some way to make it workable as it is. If you used the Motif Rack as your sole sound source, and adopted the practice of assigning any timing-critical parts to the lowest possible track numbers (ie. to the top of the list) then the timing issues might be considered negligible. However, I'm duty-bound to point out that the discrepancies begin to show up when the Motif Rack is part of a larger MIDI setup, in which context it is, after all, likely to be used — so this is clearly an issue which has to be resolved at the earliest opportunity. Taking the optimistic view that a solution is possible, I'll round up by saying that, given the choice of similarly priced (and cheaper) alternatives now available in the sample-based, multitimbral synth module arena, it is the additional sonic potential of those plug-in boards that is most likely to sway potential buyers in favour of the Motif Rack.

Since Yamaha have been championing the mLAN cause by fitting the Motif 6/7/8 with a slot for an optional mLAN8E board, it's interesting to note that they have omitted this option from the Motif Rack — especially in view of the recent launch at Frankfurt of the mLAN-equipped 01X Production Studio. As we know, mLAN is supposed to be able to cope with many hundreds of MIDI channels and up to 128 channels of audio down one cable, and while this may be more relevant to the Motif 6/7/8 (with its integrated sampling sequencer), surely it would also be a useful feature on the Motif Rack? Particularly since the 01X can also function not only as an audio mixer but as a complete MIDI control surface — which could naturally be used to extend the performance potential of the Motif Rack.

At present, it's not too clear when or whether other manufacturers will embrace mLAN (much less stick to the same set of rules...), so maybe Yamaha are biding their time until they release the next incarnation of the Motif.

Extended polyphony and improved range of effects over Motif keyboards.

Arpeggiator outputs over MIDI.

cons

Button-intensive editing without the software editor.

Slightly inflexible effects deployment.

Some worrying timing problems in multitimbral use at the time of review.

summary

The essential sound of the keyboard Motifs in a 1U rack, with enhancements. The absence of the sampler and sequencer facilities are made up for with a doubling of polyphony, more effects and outputs, extra preset and user banks, arpeggiator output over MIDI and an excellent (if PC-only...) software sequencer. However, at the time of writing, the Motif Rack is compromised when operating multitimbrally, and this must be addressed before it can be considered a practical alternative to the Motif keyboard.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The body of an Ebola victim remains contagious after death, so collectors must carry full protective gear as they prepare to do their job.

Originally published on December 31, 2014 7:40 am

""When I wake up in the morning, I will pray to God to give me strength and focus,"" says 21-year-old Sorie Fofana.

His job is collecting the bodies of those who die from Ebola in Monrovia, Liberia's capital city of roughly 1 million people. Before, Fofana was an artist, making designs for T-shirts. The new job pays better — $1,000 a month. But every morning, the lanky, laid-back Fofana has to steel himself to go out and do the job.

Fofana serves on one of four government teams of specially trained body collectors in Monrovia, funded by the International Federation of the Red Cross. It's a critical task as the Ebola epidemic worsens in Liberia, with more than 1,300 suspected and confirmed cases, and nearly 700 deaths. In the densely populated city, when someone dies of Ebola, many more people may become infected by coming into contact with the body.

On a recent morning, the body collectors pull up to their first stop: a dirt lot at the edge of a steep hill overlooking a river. They've come to collect the corpse of Rachel Wleh.

The men change out of jeans and sneakers, into surgical scrubs and rubber boots.

Alexander Nyanti, 23, used to study economics at a local college. But the college is closed, along with every other school here, because of the Ebola outbreak.

Nyanti isslender and soft-spoken. He looks a little nervous at the thought of going into Wleh's house. ""I don't feel fine,"" he says. ""But I have to go there. I must go there.""

Mark Korvayan is the team leader. He's a longtime employee of the Ministry of Health and a father figure to the crew.

The men gather up their gearand begin the difficult hike down the hillside, carefully picking their way over rocks strewn with trash and drying laundry.

At the base of the hill, they walk past a cluster of cement-block homes at the river's edge. People stream out of the doorways. The whole neighborhood is turning out to watch. Wleh's husband was the doctor at the local clinic. That's also where the family lived. He came down with Ebola earlier this month and died a few days ago. Wleh took sick soon after. She died the day before.

Wleh's four children, ages 15 to 22, stand to one side. They hug their arms to their chests and hang their heads. ""She was vomiting,"" says Larry, the oldest. ""She said she was just feeling weak.""

As Larry describes his mother's symptoms, Korvayan strides up to warn him that he and his brothers and sister absolutely must get tested for Ebola. If they touched their mother while she was sick, there's a good chance they've been infected, too.

Wleh's kids just stare back at him, panic flickering in their eyes. Finally, Larry speaks up. He mumbles that their health is fine. Their problem is a different one: In the space of a few days, they've become orphans: ""We don't have a father. We don't have a mother.""

The team dons the last layer of protective gear. They unfurl white plastic jumpsuits and pull them on. Next come face masks and goggles. They tape their sleeves shut with meticulous care and check each other for exposed skin. Their life depends on getting this right: The corpse of a person who dies of Ebola leaks bodily fluids loaded with the virus. Anyone who comes into contact with those fluids can become infected.

Their last defense is a prayer. The men gather in a circle and touch hands: ""God our father, ... as we are going in ... may you be the protector. We will take the precautionary measures, but may you seal us with your holy spirit and with your angels ...""

Korvayan claps his hands twice to signal it's time to go in. They enter the house slowly, single file, and head into a bedroom.

They emerge a few minutes later. They've packed Wleh in a green body bag and drag it across the floor.

They pause at the door to figure out the best way to lift the body safely, then proceed out of the house.

As they carry Wleh past the crowd, several women begin wailing. Others join in. The cries swell to a chorus. Wleh was beloved in this neighborhood. This is the closest thing she'll get to a funeral.

The hike back up the hill is excruciating. At the top, the men stop under a tree and collapse against it. Korvayan says the state of Wleh's corpse was unnerving. ""When I saw the body,"" he says, ""my skin creeped."" She was lying on a bed, blood leaking from her mouth.

The men carry Wleh's body over to a long flatbed truck. They heave it in and drag it to the back.

Now comes the most dangerous part: getting out of their protective suits. They arch their backs and contort their limbs in an awkward shimmy to avoid touching the outside of the suit. Then they spray each suit with disinfectant and place the suits in a trash bag.

Despite the pay — generous by Liberian standards — the men say their families do not want them doing the work. Nyanti, the economics student, says his parents won't even let him stay in the house. They're worried he's going to infect them all. Fofana's parents have begged him to quit.

""My mom and dad don't want me to do this job,"" he says. ""But I feel I should do it to save my nation.""

Like the other men, Fofana says that what started as just a job has become a calling. He is seeing firsthand how crucial this work is to stopping Ebola's spread. He knows the risks. But, he says, someone's got to do it: ""I'm going to save my country. If I die, I die for my country.""

The men close up the back of the truck.

Korvayan says he can't even guess how many bodies he's picked up since he started this work. ""I cannot give you a specific number. I've gone far. I have picked up enough.""

But their work is never done. They've got six more bodies to pick up today, and after that a long drive to the city's crematorium.

Tomorrow they'll do it all over again.

MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:

Twenty-thousand - that's how many people the World Health Organization predicts will be infected with Ebola in the next six to nine months. 3,000 people are known to have already come down with the deadly virus. About half of them have died.

One of the epicenters of Ebola is the West African country of Liberia. In the densely populated capital of Monrovia, a major concern is how corpses are handled; they're highly infectious. Every day, specially trained teams go out to collect the bodies and they're not able to keep up with the demand. NPR's Nurith Aizenman went out with one of those teams.

NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: The body collectors pull up to their first stop of the day. It's a dirt lot at the edge of a steep hill overlooking a river. They've come to collect the corpse of a woman who died in a house at the bottom. Her name was Rachel Wleh.

The men change out of jeans and sneakers into surgical scrubs and rubber boots. They're one of four teams doing this work in Monrovia with funding from the International Federation of the Red Cross.

ALEXANDER NYANTI: I have my surgical gloves, as you can see. I have my heavy-duty gloves. I have my goggles.

AIZENMAN: Alexander Nyanti is pulling on his surgical gloves and gathering his goggles. He used to be a student studying economics at a local college. But the college has been closed along with every other school here because of the Ebola outbreak. Nyanti's 23, slender and soft-spoken. He looks a little nervous at the thought of going into Wleh's house.

NYANTI: I don't feel fine, but I have to go there. I must go there.

AIZENMAN: A few feet away, Sorie Fofana is more nonchalant. He's the creative one.

SORIE FOFANA: I was an artist - T-shirts, drawings.

AIZENMAN: People used to pay him to put his designs on their T-shirts, but this job pays better. He's 21, lanky and laid-back. Still, he says, every morning he has to steel himself to go out.

FOFANA: When I wake up in the morning I will pray to God to give me strength and focus.

AIZENMAN: Mark Korvayan is the team's leader. He's a longtime employee of the Ministry of Health and a father figure to the crew.

MARK KORVAYAN: I'm the head of the team - the burial team personnel.

AIZENMAN: The men gather up their gear and begin the slow climb down the hillside, picking their way carefully over rocks strewn with trash and drying laundry. At the base of the hill, they walk past cement block homes at the river's edge. People stream out of the doorways. The whole neighborhood is turning out to watch this.

Wleh's husband was the doctor at the local clinic - that's also where the family lived. He came down with Ebola earlier this month and died a few days ago. Wleh got sick soon after. She died yesterday afternoon.

Wleh's children stand to one side. They hug their arms to their chests and hang their heads. The eldest, Larry Wleh, is 22.

LARRY WLEH: She was vomiting. She had chills. She was feeling weak.

AIZENMAN: As he describes his mother's symptoms, Korvayan marches up to warn Larry Wleh that he and his brothers and sister absolutely must get tested. If they touched their mother while she was sick, there's a good chance they've been infected too.

KORVAYAN: You say you did not touch your mother? Now, who touched her? The person that touched her needs to report himself to the center.

AIZENMAN: Wleh's kids stare back at Korvayan in mute horror. Finally Larry, the eldest, speaks up. He mumbles that their health is fine. Their problem is a different one - in the space of a few days they've become orphans.

WLEH: We don't have a father, we don't have a mother.

AIZENMAN: The team begins putting on their last layer of protective gear. They unfurl white plastic jumpsuits and pull them on. Next come the face masks and goggles. They tape their sleeves shut with meticulous care and check each other for exposed skin. Their life depends on getting this right. The corpse of a person who dies of Ebola is extremely dangerous. It leaks bodily fluids loaded with the virus. Anyone who comes into contact with those fluids can become infected. Their last defense is a prayer. The men gather in a circle and touch hands.

God, our father - as we are going in, may you be the protector, Korvayan says. We will take the precautionary measures, but may you seal us with your holy spirit and with your angels.

Korvayan claps his hands to signal it's time to go in. The men walk into the house slowly, single file and head into a bedroom.

They emerge a few minutes later. They've packed Wleh in an army green body bag and drag it across the floor. They pause at the door and discuss the best way to lift up the body safely and then proceed out of the house.

As they carry Wleh past the crowd, several women begin wailing. The cries swell to a chorus. Wleh was beloved in this neighborhood. This is the closest thing she'll get to a funeral.

The hike back up the hill is excruciating. At the top, the men stop under a tree and collapse against it. Korvayan says the state of Wleh's corpse was unnerving.

KORVAYAN: Well, when I saw the body, my skin creeped.

AIZENMAN: He says they found Wleh lying on a bed, blood leaking from her mouth.

KORVAYAN: Her nose, I saw was saliva. Very wet saliva. Wet. But her mouth - she was leaking with blood.

AIZENMAN: The men carry Wleh's body over to a long flatbed truck. They heave it in and drag it to the back.

Now comes the most dangerous part - getting out of their protective suits. They arch their backs and contort their limbs in an awkward shimmy to avoid touching the outside. Then they spray each suit with disinfectant solution and place it in a trash bag.

The men are paid for this work, a thousand dollars a month - generous by Liberian standards. But their families do not want them doing it. Nyanti, the economic student, says his parents won't even let him stay in the house. They're worried he's going to infect them all. Fofana's parents have begged him to quit.

FOFANA: My mom and dad do not want me to do the job. But I feel I can do it to save my nation.

AIZENMAN: Like the other men, Fofana says that what started out as just a job, a way to earn a living, has become a calling. He's seeing firsthand how crucial this work is to stopping the Ebola's spread. He knows the risks, but he says, someone's got to do it for the country.

FOFANA: I'm going to serve my country. If I die, I die for my country.

AIZENMAN: The men close up the back of the truck. They've got six more bodies to pick up today. And after that, a long drive to the crematorium. Tomorrow they'll do it all over again.

Korvayan says he can't even guess how many bodies he's collected since he started this work.

OREGON v. MATHIASON, 429
U.S. 492 (1977)

429
U.S. 492

OREGON v. MATHIASON
ON PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE SUPREME COURT OF OREGON

No. 76-201.

Decided January 25, 1977

Where respondent in response to a police officer's request voluntarily came to a police station for questioning about a burglary and was immediately informed that he was not under arrest, and at the close of a half-hour interview left the station without hindrance, respondent was not in custody ""or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way,"" Miranda v. Arizona,
384
U.S. 436, 444
, so as to require that his confession to the burglary obtained during such interview be suppressed at his state criminal trial because he was not given Miranda warnings prior to being questioned.

Certiorari granted; 275 Ore. 1, 549 P.2d 673, reversed and remanded.

PER CURIAM.

Respondent Carl Mathiason was convicted of first-degree burglary after a bench trial in which his confession was critical to the State's case. At trial he moved to suppress the confession as the fruit of questioning by the police not preceded by the warnings required in Miranda v. Arizona,
384
U.S. 436
(1966). The trial court refused to exclude the confession because it found that Mathiason was not in custody at the time of the confession.

The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed respondent's conviction, but on his petition for review in the Supreme Court of Oregon that court by a divided vote reversed the conviction. It found that although Mathiason had not been arrested or otherwise formally detained, ""the interrogation took place in a `coercive environment'"" of the sort to which Miranda was intended to apply. The court conceded that its holding was contrary to decisions in other jurisdictions, and referred in particular to People v. Yukl, 25 N. Y. 2d 585, 256 N. E. 2d 172 (1969). The State of Oregon has
[429
U.S. 492, 493]
petitioned for certiorari to review the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon. We think that court has read Miranda too broadly, and we therefore reverse its judgment.

The Supreme Court of Oregon described the factual situation surrounding the confession as follows:

""An officer of the State Police investigated a theft at a residence near Pendleton. He asked the lady of the house which had been burglarized if she suspected anyone. She replied that the defendant was the only one she could think of. The defendant was a parolee and a `close associate' of her son. The officer tried to contact defendant on three or four occasions with no success. Finally, about 25 days after the burglary, the officer left his card at defendant's apartment with a note asking him to call because `I'd like to discuss something with you.' The next afternoon the defendant did call. The officer asked where it would be convenient to meet. The defendant had no preference; so the officer asked if the defendant could meet him at the state patrol office in about an hour and a half, about 5:00 p. m. The patrol office was about two blocks from defendant's apartment. The building housed several state agencies.

""The officer met defendant in the hallway, shook hands and took him into an office. The defendant was told he was not under arrest. The door was closed. The two sat across a desk. The police radio in another room could be heard. The officer told defendant he wanted to talk to him about a burglary and that his truthfulness would possibly be considered by the district attorney or judge. The officer further advised that the police believed defendant was involved in the burglary and [falsely stated that] defendant's fingerprints were found at the scene. The defendant sat for a few minutes and then said he had taken the property. This occurred within five minutes after defendant had come to the office. The
[429
U.S. 492, 494]
officer then advised defendant of his Miranda rights and took a taped confession.

""At the end of the taped conversation the officer told defendant he was not arresting him at this time; he was released to go about his job and return to his family. The officer said he was referring the case to the district attorney for him to determine whether criminal charges would be brought. It was 5:30 p. m. when the defendant left the office.

""The officer gave all the testimony relevant to this issue. The defendant did not take the stand either at the hearing on the motion to suppress or at the trial."" 275 Ore. 1, 3-4, 549 P.2d 673, 674 (1976).

The Supreme Court of Oregon reasoned from these facts that:

""We hold the interrogation took place in a `coercive environment.' The parties were in the offices of the State Police; they were alone behind closed doors; the officer informed the defendant he was a suspect in a theft and the authorities had evidence incriminating him in the crime; and the defendant was a parolee under supervision. We are of the opinion that this evidence is not overcome by the evidence that the defendant came to the office in response to a request and was told he was not under arrest."" Id., at 5, 549 P.2d, at 675.

Our decision in Miranda set forth rules of police procedure applicable to ""custodial interrogation."" ""By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.""
384
U.S., at 444
. Subsequently we have found the Miranda principle applicable to questioning which takes place in a prison setting during a suspect's term of imprisonment on a separate offense, Mathis v. United States,
391
U.S. 1
(1968), and to questioning taking place in a
[429
U.S. 492, 495]
suspect's home, after he has been arrested and is no longer free to go where he pleases, Orozco v. Texas,
394
U.S. 324
(1969).

In the present case, however, there is no indication that the questioning took place in a context where respondent's freedom to depart was restricted in any way. He came voluntarily to the police station, where he was immediately informed that he was not under arrest. At the close of a 1/2-hour interview respondent did in fact leave the police station without hindrance. It is clear from these facts that Mathiason was not in custody ""or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.""

Such a noncustodial situation is not converted to one in which Miranda applies simply because a reviewing court concludes that, even in the absence of any formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement, the questioning took place in a ""coercive environment."" Any interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer Miranda warnings to everyone whom they question. Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect. Miranda warnings are required only where there has been such a restriction on a person's freedom as to render him ""in custody."" It was that sort of coercive environment to which Miranda by its terms was made applicable, and to which it is limited.

The officer's false statement about having discovered Mathiason's fingerprints at the scene was found by the Supreme Court of Oregon to be another circumstance contributing to the coercive environment which makes the Miranda rationale applicable. Whatever relevance this fact
[429
U.S. 492, 496]
may have to other issues in the case, it has nothing to do with whether respondent was in custody for purposes of the Miranda rule.

The petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

So ordered.

MR.
JUSTICE BRENNAN would grant the writ but dissents from the summary disposition and would set the case for oral argument.

MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, dissenting.

The respondent in this case was interrogated behind closed doors at police headquarters in connection with a burglary investigation. He had been named by the victim of the burglary as a suspect, and was told by the police that they believed he was involved. He was falsely informed that his fingerprints had been found at the scene, and in effect was advised that by cooperating with the police he could help himself. Not until after he had confessed was he given the warnings set forth in Miranda v. Arizona,
384
U.S. 436
(1966).

The Court today holds that for constitutional purposes all this is irrelevant because respondent had not ""`been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.'"" Ante, at 494, quoting Miranda v. Arizona, supra, at 444. I do not believe that such a determination is possible on the record before us. It is true that respondent was not formally placed under arrest, but surely formalities alone cannot control. At the very least, if respondent entertained an objectively reasonable belief that he was not free to leave during the questioning, then he was ""deprived of his freedom of action in a significant way.""
1
[429
U.S. 492, 497]
Plainly the respondent could have so believed, after being told by the police that they thought he was involved in a burglary and that his fingerprints had been found at the scene. Yet the majority is content to note that ""there is no indication that . . . respondent's freedom to depart was restricted in any way,"" ante, at 495, as if a silent record (and no state-court findings) means that the State has sustained its burden, see Lego v. Twomey,
404
U.S. 477, 489
(1972), of demonstrating that respondent received his constitutional due.
2

More fundamentally, however, I cannot agree with the Court's conclusion that if respondent were not in custody no warnings were required. I recognize that Miranda is limited to custodial interrogations, but that is because, as we noted last Term, the facts in the Miranda cases raised only this ""narrow issue."" Beckwith v. United States,
425
U.S. 341, 345
(1976). The rationale of Miranda, however, is not so easily cabined.

Miranda requires warnings to ""combat"" a situation in which there are ""inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel
[429
U.S. 492, 498]
him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.""
384
U.S., at 467
. It is of course true, as the Court notes, that ""[a]ny interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it."" Ante, at 495. But it does not follow that because police ""are not required to administer Miranda warnings to everyone whom they question,"" ibid., that they need not administer warnings to anyone, unless the factual setting of the Miranda cases is replicated. Rather, faithfulness to Miranda requires us to distinguish situations that resemble the ""coercive aspects"" of custodial interrogation from those that more nearly resemble ""[g]eneral on-the-scene questioning . . . or other general questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process"" which Miranda states usually can take place without warnings.
384
U.S., at 477
.

In my view, even if respondent were not in custody, the coercive elements in the instant case were so pervasive as to require Miranda-type warnings.
3
Respondent was interrogated in ""privacy"" and in ""unfamiliar surroundings,"" factors on which Miranda places great stress. Id., at 449-450; see also Beckwith v. United States, supra, at 346 n. 7. The investigation had focused on respondent. And respondent was subjected to some of the ""deceptive stratagems,"" Miranda v. Arizona, supra, at 455, which called forth the Miranda decision. I therefore agree with the Oregon Supreme Court that to excuse the absence of warnings given these facts is ""contrary to the rationale expressed in Miranda."" 275 Ore. 1, 5, 549 P.2d 673, 675 (1976).
4
[429
U.S. 492, 499]

The privilege against self-incrimination ""has always been `as broad as the mischief against which it seeks to guard.'"" Miranda v. Arizona, supra, at 459-460, quoting Counselman v. Hitchcock,
142
U.S. 547, 562
(1892). Today's decision means, however, that the Fifth Amendment privilege does not provide full protection against mischiefs equivalent to, but different from, custodial interrogation.
5
See also Beckwith v. United States, supra. It is therefore important to note that the state courts remain free, in interpreting state constitutions, to guard against the evil clearly identified by this case.
6

It has been noted that as a logical matter, a person who honestly but unreasonably believes he is in custody is subject to the same coercive pressures as one whose belief is reasonable; this suggests that such persons also are entitled to warnings. See, e. g., LaFave, ""Street Encounters"" and the Constitution: Terry, Sibron, Peters, and Beyond, 67 Mich. L. Rev. 39, 105 (1968); Smith, The Threshold Question in Applying Miranda: What Constitutes Custodial Interrogation?, 25 S. C. L. Rev. 699, 711-714 (1974).

[
Footnote 2
] The Court's action is particularly inappropriate because the record of this case has not been transmitted to us, and thus our knowledge of the facts is limited to the information contained in the petition and in the opinions of the state courts.

[
Footnote 3
] I do not rule out the possibility that lesser warnings would suffice when a suspect is not in custody but is subjected to a highly coercive atmosphere. See, e. g., Beckwith v. United States,
425
U.S. 341, 348
-349 (1976) (MARSHALL, J., concurring in judgment); ALI, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure 110.1 (2) (Approved Draft 1975) (suspects interrogated at police station must be advised of their right to leave and right to consult with counsel, relatives, or friends).

[
Footnote 5
] I trust today's decision does not suggest that police officers can circumvent Miranda by deliberately postponing the official ""arrest"" and the giving of Miranda warnings until the necessary incriminating statements have been obtained.

In Opperman, this Court reversed a decision of the South Dakota Supreme Court holding that routine inventory searches of impounded automobiles, made without probable cause or consent, violated the Fourth Amendment. The case was remanded, like this one, ""for further proceedings not inconsistent with [the] opinion.""
428
U.S., at 376
. On remand, the South Dakota Supreme Court held that such searches violated a nearly identical provision of the State Constitution, and that therefore the seized evidence should have been suppressed. State v. Opperman, 89 S. D. ___, 228 N. W. 2d 152 (1976).

MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.

In my opinion the issues presented by this case are too important to be decided summarily. Of particular importance
[429
U.S. 492, 500]
is the fact that the respondent was on parole at the time of his interrogation in the police station. This fact lends support to inconsistent conclusions.

On the one hand, the State surely has greater power to question a parolee about his activities than to question someone else. Moreover, as a practical matter, it seems unlikely that a Miranda warning would have much effect on a parolee's choice between silence and responding to police interrogation. Arguably, therefore, Miranda warnings are entirely inappropriate in the parole context.

On the other hand, a parolee is technically in legal custody continuously until his sentence has been served. Therefore, if a formalistic analysis of the custody question is to determine when the Miranda warning is necessary, a parolee should always be warned. Moreover, Miranda teaches that even if a suspect is not in custody, warnings are necessary if he is ""otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way."" If a parolee being questioned in a police station is not described by that language, today's decision qualifies that part of Miranda to some extent. I believe we would have a better understanding of the extent of that qualification, and therefore of the situations in which warnings must be given to a suspect who is not technically in custody, if we had the benefit of full argument and plenary consideration.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Love, Beauty, and Charity

Inasmuch as love grows in you, in so much beauty grows; for love is itself the beauty of the soul.
Augustine of Hippo

There is a variant translation to this quote.

“Beauty grows in you to the extent that love grows, because charity itself is the soul’s beauty.”

Philanthropy is love in action. Through your actions, through your philanthropy, through your charity, you share your love for the world with the world. When love is shared, love grows making yourself and the world a little more beautiful.

In whatever way that looks like in your life, I want to thank you for bringing more beauty, more love, more charity, and more change to this world.

As 2017 comes to a close, we mark the end of another year at Change Gangs. It was a great year, and together we donated $13,683 to great charities around the world. Since we founded, we’ve given $65,243.50 to nearly 100 different charities.

Here are our final recipients of the year.

People for Pets Giving Circle

This year, the Pets Giving Circle gave $5,335 for a total of $25,833 to great pet charities. For our last donation in 2017, we chose Big Bones Canine Rescue.

Big Bones is a 100% volunteer based shelter and foster based rescue network for all breeds of Mastiff and Great Danes. They receive dogs that are about to be euthanized from shelters in CA, TX, OK, KS, and NM. They have a 13 acre property in Windsor, CO with 4 buildings that can hold up to 30 dogs. All the dogs have indoor and outdoor areas that they can access, plus there are isolated kennels to keep new or sick dogs until their health and temperament can be assessed. In 2015, they adopted out 598 dogs. In 2016, they adopted 860 dogs- 250 of whom were puppies.

Poverty Busters

This year, Poverty Busters donated $4,727.50 for a total of $26,460. For our last donation in 2017, we chose Project Self-Sufficiency.

Located in Loveland, CO, Project Self-Sufficiency creates opportunities for single parent families to become selfpowered by providing intensive support to parents who are ready to build new career pathways. When participants enter the program they are partnered with a skilled advisor who helps them calculate a living wage for the family and then customizes a career planning curriculum and time frame for meeting that living wage. While in school or training for a new career, participants receive help to improve the family’s health (physical and mental), access to reliable transportation, child care, and affordable housing. It can take several years to graduate from the program.

Veterans Giving Circle

This year, the Veterans Giving Circle donated $2,745.50 for a total of $10,625. For our last donation in 2017, we chose War Horses for Heroes.WarHorses for Heroes provides equine-assisted therapy to veterans who have sustained service-related mental or physical injuries. As a therapy partner for those with mental illness, a horse is intuitive and non-judgmental, providing a trusting and open environment for processing and healing. Veterans with histories of depression or PTSD who participate in equine assisted therapy experience consistent improvement in depression symptoms and increased sociability. Veterans with physical injuries also benefit. Horseback riding benefits the rehabilitation process because the rhythm of a horse’s gait is similar to that of a human’s. It provides the sensation of movement to those with severe injuries affecting mobility. Veterans with spinal cord injuries or other physical disabilities experience improved muscle strength and better balance after participating in equine assisted therapy programs.

"A film experience

Although the film is based on history, “Red Tails” is no staid documentary. It is an action-packed experience that plunges the audience deeply into fast-paced World War II dogfights. It also draws the audience into the brotherhood of black fighter pilots facing the battle against Nazis and racism. The film gives a realistic look back at the struggle of the first Tuskegee Airmen to be recognized as capable pilots despite a long history of prejudice in America’s military.

“We had an agenda of really inspiring and uplifting youth. It’s one page being turned out of many in getting our stories told,” Hemingway said.

Parker, 32, said connecting with the experience of being a young black man in the era of Jim Crow was easier when he began to draw the parallel between the obstacles of the young men of the 1940s with those of modern times.

How to be the most awesome Dad ever

To be the most awesome Dad ever, capable of carrying out feats of skill and mastery usually reserved for the likes of the Avatar, James Bond, or the Doctor, requires just a few common ingredients:

The locked, most secret diary of a pre-adolescent daughter (who has lost the key),

The knowledge that all such cheap locks are the same,

A set of cheap luggage locks with keys,

A frantic pre-adolescent daughter in possession of #1 but not #2 or #3, and

A flair for the dramatic, with which one discloses that one knows how to pick locks, but it's a secret handed down from master spy to master spy, therefore the work must be done behind a locked door (which neatly conceals the fact that you're rummaging around in your bedroom drawer to find #3).",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

KFOR-TV and NBC News reported that seven of the dead were children who drowned at Plaza Towers Elementary, where 75 students and staff members were huddled when the tornado struck around 3 p.m. (4 p.m. EDT). U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, who has lived in Moore for more than 50 years, told CNN the school did not have an underground shelter, just interior rooms with no windows.

Estimates of the tornado’s size ranged from a half-mile to two miles wide; video showed a large debris ball at its base at some points. The National Weather Service preliminarily categorized it as an EF-4 in strength.

Expect another sticky and hot day, with a high in the 80s, and stay alert for scattered showers and storms, Poteet says. Many residents already heard plenty of thunder overnight: Thousands were without power following an overnight line of storms that downed trees and took down power lines.

The fire ravaged the home of Stephanie Eppert, who lived there with her four children, three of whom have autism. Two of them, brother and sister Genesis Eppert, 9, and Forrest Eppert, 8, were killed in the blaze. The family was expected to move this year into a new home specially built by Habitat for Humanity for the children.

“Shame on Vogel for not genuflecting when he mentioned the Heat, or for volunteering to kiss James’ ring — ring singular, not rings,” wrote the columnist, tongue firmly in cheek. If you recall, Vogel said on Saturday that Miami was simply the “next” team in the Pacers’ way to an NBA Finals; James took it for an insult. The teams meet next on Wednesday night for Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.

The poverty rate rose faster in Indianapolis in the last decade than in all but seven other large cities, according to a book released Monday on poverty in metropolitan areas. The share of the city’s population in poverty increased from 11.95 percent to 21.4 percent between 2000 and 2011. The suburban poverty rate in metro Indianapolis rose from 5 percent to 7.7 percent. Said Robert Wilson of Gleaners Food Bank: “We’re just not creating jobs fast enough, and we’re not creating enough good paying jobs that you can support a family on. So we are continuing to distribute record-breaking amounts of food.”

The lawsuit pits seven stylists at Lou’s Creative Styles in Lawrence against a former co-worker, Christina “Christy” Shaw, who holds the winning ticket in a Feb. 16 Hoosier Lottery drawing worth an estimated $9.5 million. Shaw’s co-workers says they are due a share of the winnings.

Between 2009 and 2012, the company shielded at least $74 billion in profits by setting up shell companies in Ireland, the report said. While the practice of using foreign operations to avoid U.S. taxes is legal and common, Apple’s scheme was unprecedented in its use of multiple affiliates that had no semblance of a physical presence, Senate staffers said. Apple CEO Tim Cook plans to vehemently defend the company before the panel on Tuesday, arguing that Apple does not break any tax laws, according to a copy of the firm’s prepared testimony.

Manzarek succumbed to bile duct cancer, according to his manager, Tom Vitorino. He founded the groundbreaking band in 1965 with the singer and lyricist Jim Morrison, later joined by drummer John Densmore and guitarist Robby Krieger. While Morrison died young and achieved legendary status, Manzarek also played a crucial role in developing their sound and popularity.

When the comedian was just starting out, he struck up a friendship with Elizabeth “Mimi” Haist, a woman who volunteered at a Los Angeles laundromat and depended on tips from customers, the New York Daily News reports. When Galifianakis learned a few years ago that his friend, 87, had fallen on hard times and was homeless, he got her an apartment and started taking her to red carpet events. “I’m looking forward to it, I like the excitement of it,” Haist said of his latest movie premiere.

Zendaya has a 1-point edge on Kellie Pickler after Monday night’s performance final. One casualty beyond the other two teams: Val Chmerkovskiy bloodied his face when he bashed it during Monday rehearsals when Zendaya accidentally hit him just above the eye with her elbow.

"The Atlanta University Center Consortium Council of Presidents and Mayor Kasim Reed announced the completion of a collaborative surveillance program that strategically places video cameras and license plate readers around the campus community to create a safer environment.

Working through the University Community Development Corp., a community development arm of the AUC, Presidents John Wilson, Ronald Johnson, Valerie Montgomery Rice, and Mary Schmidt Campbell have forged a partnership with the Atlanta Police Foundation and the Atlanta Police Department to install 35 cameras and five license plate readers around the AUC community. The cameras are monitored by AUC police at their respective schools and APD’s video integration center.

Each institution – Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morehouse School of Medicine, Spelman College – paying equal amounts, and the mayor’s office contributing the remaining balance, funded the $700,000 project. The effort highlights the priority the AUC institutions and the city have to combat crime in the community.

In its famous paradox, the equation of money and excrement, psychoanalysis becomes the first science to state what common sense and the poets have long known - that the essence of money is in its absolute worthlessness.

Norman O. Brown

The middlebrow is the man, or woman, of middlebred intelligence who ambles and saunters now on this side of the hedge, now on that, in pursuit of no single object, neither art itself nor life itself, but both mixed indistinguishably, and rather nastily, with money, fame, power, or prestige.

There's a great deal of disturbance in this country and how black feel about what happened in Katrina, and, you know, many of the comics, many of performers are in Las Vegas and New Orleans trying to raise money for what happened there.

Michael Richards

Waste neither time nor money, but make the best use of both. Without industry and frugality, nothing will do, and with them everything.

Billions are wasted on ineffective philanthropy. Philanthropy is decades behind business in applying rigorous thinking to the use of money.

Michael Porter

For money you can have everything it is said. No, that is not true. You can buy food, but not appetite; medicine, but not health; soft beds, but not sleep; knowledge but not intelligence; glitter, but not comfort; fun, but not pleasure; acquaintances, but not friendship; servants, but not faithfulness; grey hair, but not honor; quiet days, but not peace. The shell of all things you can get for money. But not the kernel. That cannot be had for money.

"Jets on the hunt for options on offence

WINNIPEG — It can be a foolish game to play, trying to connect the dots through the first weekend of the National Hockey League’s free agency period and attempting to draw any kind of concrete conclusions.

But we’re going to wade in and do it anyway.

Fact #1: The Winnipeg Jets need a centre and/or winger to beef up their top two lines and provide punch to a squad that finished 20th in offence last year and lost 11 games by one goal.

Fact #2: The team signed six players — three defencemen in Randy Jones, Derek Meech and Mark Flood plus three forwards in Tanner Glass, Rick Rypien and Aaron Gagnon — who have combined to score a grand total of 40 goals in 782 NHL games.

Our brilliantly insightful conclusion: The Jets still have some work to do to jump-start their attack.
How does the franchise find offensive help with the best available unrestricted free agents on the open market already picked over?

• Jason Arnott, centre, Washington: Scored 17 last year and has 400 in his career, but turns 37 in October.

• Teemu Selanne, winger, Anaheim: Would be spectacular if he finished as a Jet — he did have 31 goals and 80 points last year — but he’s coming off knee surgery and, if he returns, it’s said that will likely be with Anaheim.

• Alex Kovalev, winger, Pittsburgh: Gifted when he’s into the game — he had 16 goals last year and 428 in his career — but he’s 38.

• Cory Stillman, winger, Carolina: Has scored at least 20 goals eight times in his long career.

• Vaclav Prospal, centre, New York Rangers: Had 23 points in 29 games with the Rangers last year, but might be looking for a new home after they landed Brad Richards.

• Nikolay Zherdev, winger, Philadelphia: He’s just 26 and has a ton of skill, but coaches get quickly frustrated with his inconsistency.

2. Trade for offence

The Jets do have some intriguing pieces that could be moved — defenceman Zach Bogosian’s name came up a lot around the draft — but the organization might not make a drastic move until it at least gets a feel for the hand they’ve been dealt and what new coach Claude Noel can do with it.

3. Consider the restricted free agent market

It would cost to chase some of the talent here — they’d have to give up draft picks, depending on how much a player is signed for — and it’s not exactly the best way to make new friends in the NHL playground. So, debate among yourselves: is Tampa superstar Steven Stamkos worth four future first-rounders? Should the Jets give up future picks for a player like Brandon Dubinksy or Ryan Callahan, both decent goal scorers with the Rangers last year?

4. Cross fingers and pray a young squad finds its goal-scoring mojo this winter

Evander Kane doesn’t turn 20 until August, has already posted 14 and 19-goal campaigns and many figure he’s got 35-40 written all over him. Andrew Ladd is just 25 and finished with a career-best 29 goals last year. Bryan Little, 23, scored 31 goals in 2008-09 and has had the same over the last two seasons. Blake Wheeler has posted 21, 18 and 18-goal campaigns over the last three years and Nik Antropov has flashed an occasional touch during his 679-game NHL career.

If those players continue their metamorphosis — and first-round draft pick Mark Scheifele is ready to jump to the pros — the Jets may have found their goal-scoring answer from within their own roster.

In the end — and as general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff stressed Friday night in meeting with the media — there’s a whole lot of time left between the opening of the free-agent market and the drop of the first puck in October.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Initially signed on a month’s loan from Celtic in January 1982 as a replacement for departing star Neil Orr, tough tackling centre-half Duffy soon made the move permanent in a £25,000 transfer.

In total he spent three-and-a-half eventful seasons in Greenock, in which time he played in three Premier League campaigns and experienced two relegations and one promotion.

Yet it is the second demotion in 1984-85 — his final season before moving to Dundee in a deal which earned Morton £65,000 — that he is perhaps most remembered for. Despite being a defender who had played in a team that was relegated after conceding 100 goals in 36 matches, Duffy’s impressive displays saw him recognised as the SPFA’s Players’ Player of the Year.

The 55-year-old looks back on his spell at the Ton as a positive time and hopes he will be celebrating another promotion next season in his capacity as manager, just as he did as a player in 1983-84.

Speaking exclusively to the Tele last night, Duffy, who has signed a two-year deal, said: “I feel this was an opportunity I couldn’t turn down. Morton approached Clyde and asked for permission to speak to me and the Clyde chairman then contacted me. It went from there.

“I don’t know who else was interviewed — it’s not my business — but once I spoke to the club I was offered the post and it was something I was absolutely thrilled to accept.

“There’s obviously a connection with the club which I’m very proud of. Benny Rooney and Mick Jackson were an unbelievable influence in my career. If Benny and Mick didn’t sign me and give me the chance to play, I wouldn’t have had a career in senior football, so I owe everything to them and Morton Football Club. They had the belief in me that I could play at the top level and they gave me the platform to do that. I could not underestimate or overstate how important they were to my career.

“Regardless of the fact I’ve now been appointed manager, I would still tell you that I owe a huge part of my career to the club and the belief the management team had in me.

“And that was in the Fergie [Sir Alex Ferguson] era at Aberdeen, the Jim McLean era at Dundee United: we were up against great teams and top class players.

“We were involved in some real tough league campaigns. But up until a few players were sold we did very well. When I came here we stayed in the Premier League for the first 18 months then we were relegated.

“Once you sell too many of your good players, you’re weakened and that’s what happened — we were relegated. But we managed to bounce straight back again, winning promotion from the First [Division] back into the Premier League on the last day of the season the year I was captain.

“So you can look at it either way: the glass is half empty or half full. You have the disappointments of relegation and the elation of promotion.

“My glass was half full and I remember my time here fondly — and I hope we will be experiencing that elation of promotion again at the end of this year.”

While Duffy doesn’t mind reminiscing about his playing days at Cappielow, he is fully focused on the job at hand and says he is aiming to take the Ton back to the Championship.

The former Falkirk, Dundee, Hibs and Brechin boss added: “It’s about where we are now and not where we were 30 years ago. I’m looking at where we are now and how we can take the club forward.

“Speaking with the chairman, I understand the demands and expectations of this job, and I’m looking forward to the challenge. I’m determined to do the best job I can. I’m under no illusions about how tough it’s going to be and I’m also fully aware that people expect Morton to be up there challenging at the top end of the table. There are high demands, but I’ve never shied away from a job or a challenge in my life in footbal. I’m sure if we can get a team showing real commitment, and playing for the jersey, the fans will get behind us and that’s my initial target.

“In reality, it’s not about what you say in newspapers or what you put on a tactics board — it’s about what you do on the pitch on a Saturday, and that will be the test for the players this season.”

Meanwhile, the Tele understands that, although a deal has not yet been finalised, another former Morton player will be installed as Duffy’s assistant.

Midfielder Craig ‘Hagi’ McPherson, 43, made 118 starts and 67 sub appearances for the Cappielow club between 1994 and 2000 and looks set to leave his position as Falkirk’s head of youth.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Why is emergency risk communication guidance needed?

During public health emergencies, people need to know what health risks they face, and what actions they can take to protect their lives, their health, their families and communities.

Accurate information, provided early, often, and in language and channels people understand, trust and use, enables people to make choices that can protect them from health hazards threatening their lives and well-being.

What is new about this guidance?

WHO has manuals, training modules and other forms of emergency communication and risk communication guidance based on expert opinion or lessons drawn from major environmental disasters, such as the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, rather than systematic analysis of the evidence. This is the first ever evidence-based risk communications guidance.

The recommendations in this guidance are based on a systematic search of the evidence on key issues in emergency risk communication practice and experience. Not only was the academic structured evidence searched but also ‘grey literature’ to ensure that the lessons learned from recent emergencies, such as the West African Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014–2015 and the global Zika virus outbreak in 2015–2016, were captured and explored fully.

Who should use this guidance?

These guidelines were developed for policy- and decision-makers responsible for managing emergencies, particularly the public health aspects of emergencies, and practitioners responsible for risk communication before, during and after health emergencies.

Other groups expected to use these guidelines are front-line responders, local, national and international development partners, civil society, the private sector and all organizations, private and public, involved in emergency preparedness and response.

What are they key recommendations in this guidance?

These guidelines provide WHO Member States, partners and stakeholders involved in emergency preparedness and response with evidence-based, up-to-date, systems-focused guidance on:

building trust and engaging with communities and affected populations;

integrating risk communication into existing national and local emergency preparedness and response structures, including building capacity for risk communication;

emergency risk communication practice - from planning, messaging, channels and methods of communication and engagement to monitoring and evaluation - based on a systematic assessment of the evidence on what worked and what did not work during recent emergencies.

How were these guidelines developed

A Guideline Development Group (GDG), comprised of experts in risk communication, media relations, public health emergencies and epidemiology, met in Geneva in July 2015 and agreed on 12 key domains of emergency risk communication requiring exploration of the evidence. Twelve questions were framed and used to guide evidence reviews, which were then used as a basis for formulating recommendations during a second meeting held in Geneva in February 2017.

An external peer review group made up of emergency risk communication practitioners, emergency responders, academics and policy-makers then reviewed the recommendations. Comments, changes and additions suggested by the External Review Group (ERG) were further reviewed by the GDG who used them to finalize the recommendations.

How should these guidelines be used?

The recommendations in these guidelines provide overarching, evidence-based guidance on how risk communication should be practiced in an emergency. The recommendations also guide countries to build capacity for communicating risk during health emergencies. Specific ‘how-to-do-it’ step-by-step instructions are beyond the remit of these guidelines. However, in due course, these will be provided in detailed manuals, standard operating procedures, pocket guides, checklists, training modules and other tools developed to elaborate the recommendations.

The first ever evidence-based WHO guidance on emergency risk communication

Evidence for decision making

The GDG agreed on 12 priority questions covering trust, community engagement, integrating emergency risk communications into health and emergency response systems and emergency risk communication practices. These questions were then further developed into potential search terms, using the SPICE Framework and used to guide the systematic reviews and a grey literature search.

Training in risk communication

This online course in risk communication features five modules of lectures and exercises to equip frontline responders and decision-makers with the information and tools they need to better manage disease outbreaks and health emergencies.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Petaluma father charged in boy's roadside death

PETALUMA -- A Petaluma man faces criminal charges after a birthday outing led to the roadside death of his daughter's 13-year-old friend.

The Santa Rosa Press Democrat (http://bit.ly/YX5IOJ ) reports that 41-year-old Mike Krnaich was charged Monday with two counts of felony child endangerment in the June 15 accident that resulted in the death of Trevor Smith.

The accident occurred when Krnaich was taking his daughter and some friends on a trip to Lake Mendocino, and his pickup truck ran out of fuel on Highway 101.

The California Highway Patrol says Smith and another boy jumped out to push the truck, and Smith got run over by the trailer the truck was pulling. He died at the scene.

"Indians are known to be optimistic about their jobs; once they have one, they assume it is theirs for life. They have a very high opinion about their performance too. They are always expecting that little bit extra from their employer — a promotion, a bonus or simply an extra coffee round.

It has become traditional in India to give bonuses during the festive season. It’s more than traditional; in several industries, it is statutory to give one month’s pay as bonus. This gives the excuse and the budget to splurge at such times. But it takes away all motivation from the bonus. Can something statutory be an incentive to work harder?

On the other hand, Indians have the fewest public holidays. According to a Mercer Worldwide Benefits and Employment survey, the UK has the highest number of workplace holidays — 36 per annum. (Ratan Tata was right when he spoke of lazy Britishers.) Other leisure-loving countries include Poland and Austria. India is near the bottom with 28. Incidentally, Indians are also amongst the most vacation deprived.

The trouble in India is that work and life are regarded as belonging to different buckets. This is true across the world. But only in emerging economies, where rural roots have not yet been forgotten, is work regarded as something alien to life. Farming was hard labour; but it was life. A job is necessary to make a living but it’s only a new generation of Indians that is internalising it. Most bosses belong to an older generation, however; they have to go before attitudes can change.

In the West, a bonus is essentially a reward for something you do over and above your normal duties. According to a WorldatWork report (see box), bonuses are in trouble. “Many would say that the economic shift in recent years has left little in the business world unscathed,” says the study. “Total rewards professionals have expressed the same concerns about bonus programmes... New findings suggest that although most respondents indicated a positive effect of bonus programmes on employee engagement, motivation and satisfaction, very few are consistently featuring bonus programmes.”

The most popular form of bonus is the referral bonus. There was a time when employees were not encouraged to recommend their friends and families for jobs in their own organisation. Today, kith and kin are supposed to be the best bets. For one, the referral comes from a person who needs to keep his own skirts clean; so you are unlikely to get a lemon. Secondly, most of the referral bonus comes after the new employee has settled in. If he proves to be a dud, you don’t get the money. Finally, this is another indication of the work-life merger.

Next in the bonus hierarchy is the sign-on bonus. This shows that even in these days of high unemployment, companies are willing to pay more for the right talent.

The spot bonus, which comes next, is most akin to the festive bonus in India. The reasons for spot bonuses are mainly special recognition, and performance above and beyond duty. They score in the high eighties in the WorldatWork poll. Project completion also features with a 72 per cent score but everything else is below 20 per cent.

The last major form of bonus — the retention bonus — is on the decline. Companies were asked if they were planning to introduce retention bonuses (if they didn’t have them). A whopping 92 per cent said ‘No’.

Bonuses work. They work best in the listed private sector (44 per cent). They also deliver in privately-held companies (33 per cent). Where they don’t is in the public sector (14 per cent) and nonprofits (13 per cent). But public sector and nonprofits bonuses — like in India where there is even a Payment of Bonus Act 1965 — don’t take performance into account. Crismus Bonus and its equivalents have an unwanted existence beyond Asterix comic books.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Archbishop Sean P. O'Malley, saying it is time for healing and reconciliation, said yesterday that he will reconsider the Archdiocese of Boston's refusals to accept money raised by Voice of the Faithful or to allow new affiliates of the lay organization to meet on church property.

O'Malley also told leaders of Voice of the Faithful that he wants to strengthen the role of lay people in administering parishes, and he pledged to make public an audit of the archdiocese's efforts to prevent sexual abuse of minors.

O'Malley met yesterday for the first time with leaders of Voice of the Faithful, an international group based in Newton claiming 30,000 members that was formed last year by Catholics upset by the church's handling of the clergy sex abuse crisis. The private meeting lasted about an hour, and was characterized by a level of mutual respect that was not present at meetings between the lay organization and Cardinal Bernard F. Law, according to participants.

O'Malley's spokesman, the Rev. Christopher J. Coyne, used the most generous language ever by a Boston church leader to describe Voice of the Faithful, an organization that around the country has been welcomed by some bishops but banned by others and which has been denounced by its critics as dissident.

""Each member of Voice of the Faithful who came made it very clear . . . that they are faithful, good members of their parishes, and that the people who are part of Voice of the Faithful are not dissidents, people who are not out to spread disunity within the church, but just people who want to help the church move forward,"" Coyne told reporters after the meeting. ""All of us around the table did not see divisions between Catholic and Catholic, but mainly just saw some issues within the family that need to be resolved.""

Coyne said that the improved assessment of Voice of the Faithful is possible because of an improved climate at the archdiocese. O'Malley recently brokered an $85 million settlement of legal claims brought by more than 500 alleged victims of clergy sexual abuse, and his straight talk, frequent meetings with victims, and steps to resolve the crisis have been generally greeted with good will.

""The circumstances in which we're all living and moving forward as a church have drastically changed in the last six months,"" Coyne said. ""While recognizing that there are still . . . many things to do, that allows for conversation that's open and honest.""

Two bishops in the United States have reversed bans against the organization: Thomas V. Daily of Brooklyn and Daniel E. Pilarczyk of Cincinnati. The organization is currently barred from meeting on church property in 10 dioceses, including Fall River, where O'Malley's successor banned the organization as one of his first acts in office.

Coyne did not characterize the likelihood of change in Boston, where Law and Bishop Richard G. Lennon -- the interim leader of the archdiocese after Law resigned -- did not accept money raised by the group and said that any chapter of the group formed after Oct. 13, 2002, would be barred from meeting on church property. ""He said that he would consider lifting the partial ban on affiliates in the archdiocese,"" Coyne said of O'Malley. ""He also asked the chancellor to look at the financial structure and setup of the Voice of Compassion fund.""

Voice of the Faithful leaders, speaking after the meeting, said O'Malley strongly suggested he was inclined to accept money raised by them. They told him it is painful for loyal Catholics to be barred from using their own parishes for meetings to discuss the state of the church, but said his posture toward lifting the ban is unclear.

Voice of the Faithful has raised approximately $100,000 from people unwilling to give directly to the archdiocese; most of the money has been contributed to Catholic Charities after Law and Lennon declined to accept it.

Voice of the Faithful President James E. Post said yesterday's meeting was ""considerably more cordial"" than six previous meetings with archdiocesan leaders. He and other leaders of the group yesterday presented a portrait of O'Malley, inscribed with a quote from O'Malley's installation homily and with the prayer of St. Francis, to the archbishop as a good-will gesture.

""We spoke and he listened; he spoke and we listened,"" Post said. ""I think Archbishop Sean has questions that need to be resolved, and of course we would provide that information. We want to get on with it.""

O'Malley was accompanied to the meeting by Lennon, Coyne, archdiocesan chancellor David W. Smith, and Barbara Thorp, who is the archdiocese's liaison to abuse victims. Post was accompanied by Steve Krueger, the organization's executive director, as well as by two active members of the organization, Elia Marnik of Reading and Margaret Roylance of Newton. The meeting took place at the house in Brighton formerly used as the archbishop's residence; O'Malley, honoring a pledge he made during the summer, earlier this week moved into the rectory at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in the South End.

""Over and over and over again, everybody kept talking about moving forward, moving towards healing,"" Coyne said. O'Malley has repeatedly said he does not know much about Voice of the Faithful, which did not have chapters in Fall River or Palm Beach when he was the bishop there. A portion of yesterday's meeting involved Voice of the Faithful members explaining how their group came about, and about its goals, which include supporting victims and ""priests of integrity"" and helping to shape structural change in the church.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) – Been to a high school graduation party this year? How about eighth grade? Or fifth grade? There’s more business for party retailers, as younger and younger grads celebrate.

It’s graduation season, and that means Tina Mazzone, manager of Westmont Party supply in South Jersey, is inflating helium balloons nearly non-stop. But it’s not just high school and college. She says more people are celebrating eighth grade and other graduations.

“I’m not sure if it’s just that people love to throw parties. And it’s an exciting thing and a happy thing. Maybe that’s the case, and maybe to encourage the kids that what they’re doing is a great thing and they’re advancing.”

Customer Lisa Wilson of Oaklyn has noticed the party explosion. “Even the younger ones. They’re doing a lot of parties for 7th and 8th grade graduations, Oaklyn goes to 9th grade so they even have those parties.”

Wilson wonders whether all of these celebrations water down the true achievements. “Personally, I think it should be reserved for 12th grade or college.”

Either way, Mazzone says more parties are definitely good for her business.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"About Mental Health Month

Mental Health Month is celebrated each year in the month of October in NSW. This awareness month encourages all of us to think about our mental health and wellbeing, regardless of whether we may have a lived experience of mental illness or not. This month also gives us the opportunity to understand the importance of mental health in our everyday lives and encourages help seeking behaviours when needed.

This year the theme for Mental Health Month is Share the Journey.

No- it’s not déjà vu – Share the Journey was the theme for 2017 as well, but we received such incredible and important feedback we decided it should be kept this year as well.

Share the Journey means – telling your friends and family when things are a bit tough – finding others who have been through something similar – connecting with your community – finding a health professional you trust – connecting on social media – giving your pet a cuddle – organisations working together for the best possible wellbeing of everyone – sharing your stories with others – creating a sense of security within families and communities – reaching out to someone who might need your help - decreasing the isolation people feel when things aren’t great

The message is important – isolation has a huge impact on the wellbeing of people whose mental health isn’t as great as they’d like it to be. We can all share the journey to make things a little easier, to make communities as supportive as possible; to make good mental health a bit more accessible for everyone.

And there are benefits to keeping the theme for all of us – greater understanding of how sharing our journeys can help, better awareness of Mental Health Month, and more preparation time for people organising fantastic community events, and our tireless, incredible grant recipients. Grant applications will open earlier – keep an eye out in mid-May - so your event can get funded earlier. It also means we can promote your events for longer, making sure as many people as possible see your message. And if you have resources left over from last year, they can all be reused this year.

Please Share the Journey with us another year, and let’s all work to make this Mental Health Month, and good mental health and wellbeing, a journey everyone in New South Wales can share.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The Music of the MRI

“Take a picture, what’s inside?
Ghost image in my mind
Natural pattern like a spider
Capillary to the center”

Sitting with our morning coffee on Sunday, our pack of dogs snuggled around and on top of us, Caryn and I were listening to NPR’s Weekend Edition. It’s a little thing we try to do on the weekends to recover from one week and steel ourselves for the next.

As soon as I heard an introduction of a segment with the letters “IRM”, my attention was caught. It is the acronym, in many languages for what we know as MRI. I made that correlation quickly. What I wasn’t getting was that this was to be an interview with a French singer about her new album.

Well, as soon as they played title track from Charlotte Gainsbourg’s release IRM, I knew that my assumption was correct.

The unmistakable whine, groan and thump, so familiar to a person living with multiple sclerosis, came across our clock radio. Had it not been for a hypnotic drum track backing the sounds of an actual MRI machine, I may have thought I was having some kind of a flashback!

Ms. Gainsbourg had a series of MRIs (and other neurologic tests with which we living with MS are all too familiar) and, like many of us, was profoundly changed by the experience inside the MRI machine’s lonely tube.

“Hold still and press the button
Looking through a glass onion
Following the X-ray eye
From the cortex to medulla”

The more I listened to her recording (which she co-authored with Beck, who is known for using ordinary sounds to create extraordinary musical experiences) the more I was brought back to my first journey into the world of magnetic revelation of my body. That drumbeat revealed itself as my heart; thumping in my throat, my ears, my eyes…my consciousness. ANYTHING to drown out the electronic grinding and the shaking which seemed to move the very room in which I lay!

I must have looked a fright as I sit, propped against a stack of pillows and in the middle of a Wheaton Terrier sandwich! Caryn didn’t say anything until a few minutes into the interview, once I had a chance to shut my gob which was slacked for the experience.

I’d never thought of those sounds, the ones we experience in total seclusion, as the basis for art. Even with a modest musical training, I never thought to allow them any place in my mind other than annoyance or fear.

I guess it just goes to show us that there can be beauty in nearly every experience; even the MRI. All we have to do is open ourselves to it. The next time (which will be this quarter), I’ll try to stay awake!

"We've known for a while. However, when you tie compensation to patient satisfaction scores, guess what happens. Luckily I work for a department that acknowledged the risks early and created formalized guidelines for narcotic prescriptions. Even having written policy handouts still doesn't prevent me from having to call security at least once a shift to escort out agitated patients who believe they are owed narcotics.

In the context of this study, what does ""for a year"" mean in regards to using opioids? Is it a continuous, had a prescription fill every month for 12 months? Is it just had another fill a year later? I feel I'm not really understanding exactly what outcomes the study measured.

I'd never taken opiods (generic Vicodin) before severely fracturing my arm. It took a week for surgery to be scheduled so I took them for about three weeks before weaning myself off of them and then stopping. Had nasty withdrawal symptoms for several days - can only imagine how difficult it must be for people who take them for any real length of time.

For a year = continued use for a year starting from the initial prescription with a gap no greater than 30 days.

Thanks! Seems in line with my initial impression before my cynicism had me questioning it.

Or, people in severe need of pain relief has the same need over a long time?

The new CDC recommendations mentioned in the article (to extremely over simplify) are to not prescribe opioids for chronic pain except in cases of cancer, palliative care, or end of life care. People in severe need of pain relief over a long period of time should not be utilizing this type of medication.

This assumes that most if not all of these patients on long term opiates don't actually need them. This is simply not the case, life-long pain due to permanent damage is quite real. A lot of it comes from the simple fact that the back-bone evolved for quadrupeds and modified for bipedal walking in a horrible hacked way that would horrify any structural engineer, tack on the obesity epidemic and you have the perfect storm for spinal cord damage

For a year = continued use for a year starting from the initial prescription with a gap no greater than 30 days.

The paper also notes that this study doesn't include prescriptions paid out of pocket or any opioids obtained illegally so the reported rates are likely underrepresentation.

On the whole, the results are not terribly surprising. Patients with more serious issues are likely to be prescribed a longer initial course of pain management and continue using them for a longer duration. Also note that the observation period was 2006 through 2015, so a good chunk of the study was before people really started to realize how problematic long term opioid use is and certainly before the new (2016) CDC guidelines.

I think that there is a genetic component involved in the addiction. I am a cancer patient and had been on OxyContin and oxycodone for +4 years. Once I realized that the opioids were making me an aggressive asshole, I went a reduction schedule and stopping completely within 60 days. I had zero withdrawal symptoms. Now I manage with over the counter pain drugs.

Or, people in severe need of pain relief has the same need over a long time?

Sure, but this is still useful information for doctors even in that context. If as a doctor you know your patient will need at least 10 days of it, you can now be aware of the likelihood that the patient will need the same drugs for much longer. Since there is a 0% chance of a patient using these for a full year and not getting addicted, a doctor should be aware of the potential consequences when starting treatment.

That doesn't mean indefinite opioid prescriptions are universally bad though. My grandmother was unwell for a very long time and suffering from extreme pain. She and her doctors were fully aware that she was addicted to the medication, but she wasn't going to ever recover anyway so this was the best they could do.

I have never been in the kind of pain that requires this kind of medication so I know that I'm not qualified to make a cost-benefit analysis here, but I find it hard to believe that these drugs are really the best we can do for people in chronic severe pain.

I'd like to see the diagnoses for greater than 10 day prescriptions. Did those people have a potentially chronic condition and that lead to long-term use?

I have neuropathy from chemotherapy, and I was in terrible pain for 12 years due to being under-medicated. I would have fallen into the long-term user category. But the solution for me wasn't opioid reduction, but switching to extended release morphine. The unintended consequence of all these crackdowns is people with moderate to severe chronic pain being undermedicated, while doing nothing to stop addiction.

Doctors have a role in not prescribing opioids willy-nilly, but to claim that opioids shouldn't be used in chronic conditions is absurd.

Or, people in severe need of pain relief has the same need over a long time?

The new CDC recommendations mentioned in the article (to extremely over simplify) are to not prescribe opioids for chronic pain except in cases of cancer, palliative care, or end of life care. People in severe need of pain relief over a long period of time should not be utilizing this type of medication.

The problem is all opioid use is the same when in there are very different valid use cases beyond the guidelines. Also, drug abuse and deaths from drug abuse have been occurring forever. What changes is the current drugs being abused. So a crackdown opioids will in reality shift much of the problem to other dangerous drugs. Then we will have a ""new epidemic"" of X.

I find the headline and general use of the word ""opiod"" a little too generic (no pun intended). The article only makes a few specific mentions of different types of opiod, does the study make the same distinctions? I'm sure the addiction rates for Vicodin are different from OxyContin are different from fentanyl (edit: oops, not the same as fenfen).

I'm sure this will spur massive new public policy reports on reducing opiod consumption and new research on marijuana effects on those with chronic pain. /s, just the last sentence

Also this article address chronic vs acute pain in that they are moving away from even using these drugs to treat chronic pain (that's pain that lasts a long time), this article is in regards to short term, acute pain.

The paper is linked in the article and does compare different medications and classes of medications. Also, fentanyl is not ""fenfen."" ""Fen-phen"" is a combination anti-obesity drug that has nothing to do with opioids.

Or, people in severe need of pain relief has the same need over a long time?

If only. It is an ever growing need when opiates are involved, which is the problem.

Not necessarily.

I have been prescribed a variety of painkillers for many years now, and whilst it took a number of years to achieve an effective combination, the prescription mix that I now take (which includes both co-codamol and tramadol) has not changed for more than a decade.

I hear the withdrawal from tramadol is pretty nasty as well, these also come in a long acting so I'm wondering why it's singled out as it is?

Correct. It does vary with the individual, but I can tell you it was bad. The only thing I've experienced worse was withdrawing from 3mg of Ativan daily (for a year). That took over two weeks of living hell to get over. I had no ""lesser drugs"" or herbs to blunt the withdrawals. Just weeks of continuous hot and cold sweats, panic attacks, and literally zero sleep at night. I couldn't even sit down for more than a couple of minutes at a time before having to get up and pace.

Also this article address chronic vs acute pain in that they are moving away from even using these drugs to treat chronic pain (that's pain that lasts a long time), this article is in regards to short term, acute pain.

Beyond excluding cancer patients and those with a history of substance use disorder, this study makes no well defined distinction between the acute vs. chronic pain/diagnosis.

Broke my arm in two places a long time ago, 25 years ago. They gave me a prescription for Percocet as if it was aspirin. Took one pill and after the effects wore off threw the rest away and started taking tylenol instead.

My mom was given Oxycodone from her Dr. for arthritis pain and by the time she passed away in 2001, she had been addicted for some time.

If everyone would have their CYP2D6 gene tested prescribers would know if a patient would metabolize a drug quickly, normally, or poorly. Knowing that would help in prescribing the appropriate treatments.

Never tried opioids/hard drugs, can someone tell me what kind of effect it gives you that is so addictive? (Just curious)

I've been taking daily opioids for over a decade and I wonder the same thing. I've never felt any high from opioids at a prescribed dose, but euphoria is common at higher doses.

The biggest problem with opioids is the physical dependence. Even missing one dose can leave you feeling lethargic, nauseated, or malaise. Withdrawal symptoms are terrible. In addition, opioid tolerance builds up after time. Addicts require increasing dosages to get high. The makes the withdrawal symptoms worse and the viscious cycle spins out of control.

And since we put people in jail instead of treating them, you get the problem we're currently experiencing.

I don't understand what this even means. As someone who right now is sitting behind this keyboard recovering from spine surgery to remove constant pain, sometimes you NEED pain killers.

If someone only gets a supply for 5 days, maybe they had a splinter and they only needed a supply for 5 days. If they got a supply for a whole month, maybe it was a big freaking deal and not just a splinter, but a real pain that may not be going away FOR LIFE until surgery is performed. Anyone can logically look at that and realize they will need multiple months. They aren't getting refills for jollies. They are getting refills, from an initial uncommon 30 day supply, again indicating it was more than just a splinter, because the pain is still there.

My background is I had a herniated disc into the spinal cord and nerve root to my right arm. All feeling and movement was replaced with numbness and nails driven through every inch of my arm from my finger tips to my neck. You can't sleep. You can't raise you head. You suffer. Pain meds made it bearable. I had this for 6 months until surgery last week which thankfully removed all the pain. I actually went the last 2 months on no pain meds. Mainly because I didn't enjoy at all going through the stigma and judgement attached to ""I need another refill"" from someone who has never experienced real pain before and has decided that I am a junkie. Oh how I wished I could have just left the pain with them and went home normal while they lived in my hell. So I just kept my last 30 day supply as an emergency and dealt with it, knowing I had surgery coming.

There is no limit to the sympathy I feel for people with chronic pain that there is no fix for. If they want pain meds, let them buy them. If they want to die on pain meds, I understand. Keep them away from those who don't need them.

As for this article, I don't see where the length of a prescription means anything other than a correlation to the severity of the injury and stigma against the patient.

My grandmother was unwell for a very long time and suffering from extreme pain. She and her doctors were fully aware that she was addicted to the medication, but she wasn't going to ever recover anyway so this was the best they could do.

My mother went through the same thing before she died. She had an inoperable problem with her spine, replaced hip, replaced knee, kidney disease, fatty liver disease, severe arthritis, diabetes, etc. She was continuously in a lot of pain. The last year she was alive, she was on extended release morphine and oxy. I am glad that she was able to get some comfort (although it did not eliminate her pain), but being on high doses of those drugs means I actually lost my mother before she died. She wasn't the same person anymore.

In the context of this study, what does ""for a year"" mean in regards to using opioids? Is it a continuous, had a prescription fill every month for 12 months? Is it just had another fill a year later? I feel I'm not really understanding exactly what outcomes the study measured.

And does it properly account for those who have switched to heroin black-market pills?

Or, people in severe need of pain relief has the same need over a long time?

The new CDC recommendations mentioned in the article (to extremely over simplify) are to not prescribe opioids for chronic pain except in cases of cancer, palliative care, or end of life care. People in severe need of pain relief over a long period of time should not be utilizing this type of medication.

The problem being that the 'other treatments' that the CDC likes to push are just as poorly studied as opiates. While they have some efficacy, to say that they can simply replace opiates on a broad scale is more than a little disingenuous.

For example, Pregabalin (Lyrica) was one of the touted medications to get people off of opiates. Except that the DEA has placed it on the controlled substances list. Oops.

Unfortunately, as is typical, policy is being made more to push headlines and get something done, anything at all. Studies like this are interesting but typically get much more traction than are really warranted and, more importantly, tend not to get amplified or repeated. Let me put out one bit of anecdotal evidence that argues against the study. Opiate prescriptions for joint replacements tend to last longer than a week. Usually two or three weeks, sometimes longer. There are a hell of a lot of patients with joint replacements and I don't see anything resembling a 20% chronic opiate use rate in these folks. Likely this reflects the patient's age (joint replacement patients tend to be older) which has an effect on addiction potential, but the point is that reality is going to be quite a bit more complex than the CDC is expressing at this point.

This particular study is set up for all sorts of biases and really should be used as a stepping stone to other research, not as a guide to policy as of yet. But repeating or expanding the study will take years and twitter blurbs take seconds.

Never tried opioids/hard drugs, can someone tell me what kind of effect it gives you that is so addictive? (Just curious)

For some folks—and I'm one of them, unfortunately—opiates very quickly bring on a feeling of wonderful, poignant, intense euphoria. It's a feeling like being warm, except instead of physical warmth it's an emotional warmth. It's like being softly enfolded in a blanket of feeling like everything is going to work out wonderfully, even if you're actually feeling pretty cruddy about life.

And there's a physical component to it, not just emotional—a humming undercurrent of goodness that attaches itself to and flows through every part of your body. Everything just feels good. You're comfortable no matter what you're doing. If you're actually injured and taking the pills for that injury, the pain is dulled and put into a little box, and you can ignore the box and not look at it if you want. If you're taking the pills and you're not injured, the effect is magnified because you don't have pain to overcome.

Everything is...super interesting, and super exciting. The video game you might be playing is literally the most entrancing, uplifting, fun, vibrant, enjoyable game you've ever played—and while you're playing it, you don't want to ever be doing anything else. The twitter feed you're reading is more fascinating than the best novel you've ever read. The twitch stream you're watching is the most profound, most important thing you've ever seen.

An opiate high makes you feel hopeful, because it makes everything not just interesting, but good. If you've got nothing to look forward to on a Tuesday afternoon except coming home after work/school to a dirty empty house and eating a frozen dinner and playing video games until you fall asleep, an opiate high makes that afternoon into something profound, fun, enjoyable, purposeful, and meaningful. It flows in between the gaps and cracks in what would otherwise be soul-crushing boring routine and fills them in with light and joy and sparkling star-stuff and makes you feel awesome about whatever you're doing.

And, at least for me, after 5 or 6 hours of bliss, the high slowly fades into a beautiful heavy-limbed drowsiness and I can then sleep soundly for 8-10 hours and wake up feeling incredibly refreshed, with a slight echo of the previous day's high.

I am not joking when I say that if I had access to an unlimited supply of opiates, I'd take them every day. Absolutely, 100%. Because they're fucking awesome.

I hear the withdrawal from tramadol is pretty nasty as well, these also come in a long acting so I'm wondering why it's singled out as it is?

Correct. It does vary with the individual, but I can tell you it was bad. The only thing I've experienced worse was withdrawing from 3mg of Ativan daily (for a year).

Just weeks of continuous hot and cold sweats, panic attacks, and literally zero sleep at night. I couldn't even sit down for more than a couple of minutes at a time before having to get up and pace.

It can vary with time too.

I had no problem when the tablets ran out after an operation I had as a kid.

Now, though, when the pharmacy have not had the tablets and I have had to go ""cold turkey"", then yes, I have experienced similar symptoms (and more) to those you describe.

That said, I have deliberately weaned myself off the opioids temporarily (just to prove to myself that I could), and to do so over a few days was possible with minimal discomfort.

My grandmother was unwell for a very long time and suffering from extreme pain. She and her doctors were fully aware that she was addicted to the medication, but she wasn't going to ever recover anyway so this was the best they could do.

I think you should be blaming the disease on losing your mother, not the drug. If she had no pain relief, you might have lost her more. Opiates are hardly a panacea - but they do have some utility.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"“GOOD IS THE ENEMY OF GREAT.” So says author Jim Collins in his best-selling book Good to Great. In other words, being good can be bad, if it leads to complacency and indifference.

If you stopped a typical man or woman on the street and asked who develops the standards they take for granted every day, you’d get a variety of answers, but almost none would say, “Why I do, of course.” But companies can’t operate that way. Great companies don’t operate that way.

Good companies use the best standards. Great companies develop them.

Here’s what great companies know. They know what standardization does for their products, for their processes, what it does for them in the marketplace, and what it does for their technical experts. Where else can technical experts get a better sense of the marketplace than in a forum of their peers? Where is there a better classroom, a better laboratory, a better network of the best minds in the industry? Technical experts who actively develop standards with other experts are far more valuable to a corporation than those who work in isolation. Great companies invest in their experts, support their involvement in standardization, and listen to them when they come home.

There is no way to operate competitively without using the best standards, whether a company’s goal is to capture the market in their hometown or in 17 countries around the world. And there is no way to be a leader in the industry without being involved in the direction in which the product is going. Standardization is the act of investing in the company’s confidence in what it is doing. It is the translation of that confidence into public acceptance. It is the secret weapon of great companies.

Standardization is the birthplace of the best ideas in the world. It’s where brilliance and stimulation and debate make good experts great ones. It’s where corporations win the battle for the market  before the product gets there. But it isn’t free. It takes commitment. It takes foresight and the investment of time and resources. What vital company function doesn’t?

Good companies can take advantage of the standards work that great companies do for them. But they won’t get there first; they won’t explore the boundaries of their fields, or see the technical trends coming. They won’t put their company’s imprint on what will become the statement that describes the product and its performance. What a loss.

For some companies, being good is enough. For others, it’s just the beginning.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"After poor show in domestic T20, Saeed Ajmal mulls retirement

Karachi: Failing to impress national selectors after back-toback shoddy performances in the domestic T20, veteran spinner Saeed Ajmal is planning to call time on his international career.

""Saeed is disappointed with his own form and his failure to come to grips with his modified bowling action. That is why he also skipped Faisalabad's last match in the tournament in Rawalpindi,"" one source told PTI informing that the off-break bowler is thinking big time about retirement.

Saeed Ajmal

Ajmal, 37, finished with two wickets at an average of 62 after conceding 124 runs in four matches and he has struggled to make an impact with his new action since early this year.

Chief selector Haroon Rasheed said there was a lot of domestic cricket to be played this season and Ajmal should keep on working on his bowling action and hope for the best.

""It is never easy to change your bowling action after you have bowled with it and enjoyed success for so many years. We feel for Ajmal and the problems he must be going through. But atleast he is trying and like I have said the doors are still open for him if he can show us his new action has also become effective,"" Rasheed said.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

DAN BARRERA VS. BEN SAUNDERS

Round 1 –Saunders looked for kicks early while Barrera eyed a takedown. Barrera spent two minutes working for the takedown and ate some knees in the process. Once the fight hit the mat, Saunders nearly secured an arm-bar submission, but Barrera escaped into his opponent’s guard. Saunders is staying as busy from the bottom as Barrera is from the top during the final minute. It should be a 10-9 round for Saunders.

Round 2 — Barrera scores the early takedown and takes his opponent’s back, but Saunders rolls out of it. Working from Saunders’ guard, Barrera does little damage from the top. The ref stands them, and Saunders throws a knee just as Barrera shoots for a takedown. The knee doesn’t connect, and Saunders looks for the arm bar. Barrera rolls out of it and takes top position again. The action again slows,and the fighters are stood again. Saunders partially lands a head kick and follows with a series of punches while Barrera tries to grab a leg. As the round ends, Saunders look for the arm bar but can’t secure it. It’s another close one, and despite the kick, it should be 10-9 for Barrera based on overall control.

Saunders takes Barrera’s back and locks in a tight body triangle. Saunders looks for the rear-naked choke and connects on some punches to soften up Barrera.

Saunders throws a body kick while Barrera again shoots. Unable to get the takedown, Barrera continues to eat some punches to the body as the round ends. It’s a 10-9 round for Saunders for what should be a 29-28 victory. Ben Saunders def. Dan Barrera via unanimous decision (30-27, 29-28, 30-27).

BILLY MILES VS. GEORGE SOTIROPOULOUS

Round 1 — Miles storms his opponent to start the round, but Sotiropoulous quickly takes his back and lands a series of blows to the head.

Round 1 — Rollins scores an early takedown, but Koppenhaver breaks free thanks to his butterfly guard. Koppenhaver now works from the top, but Rollins avoids much damage. The fighters trade — and connect on — a few elbows. Koppenhaver now throws body punches while Rollins continues elbow strikes to the top of his opponent’s head. Koppenhaver now mixes in body punches with strikes to the head as he pushes Rollins into the fence. Koppenhaver finally produces a cut, but Rollins explodes for a series of elbows that produce a cut of his own. The round finishes a bloody mess as Koppenhaver takes it, 10-9.

Round 2 — Koppenhaver is bleeding from the top of the head, and Rollins from the left eye. After a quick exchange, Koppenhaver lands a trip takedown and takes top position. Rollins continues throwing elbows from the bottom as Koppenhaver lands body punches. Both fighters are now drenched in blood. The ref stands the fighters, and Rollins throws a flying knee and Superman punch that miss. Rollins then gets the takedown and finally works from the top. Rollins has his opponent pushed against the fence and then gets side control. Koppenhaver tries to break free, and Rollins takes his back. Rollins transitions into the mount position and connects on some ground and pound and a flurry of punches. The ref looks like he wants to stop it, but the horn sounds. It’s a 10-9 round for Rollins.

Round 3 — Big ovation to start the round, and Rollins shoots for the takedown. Koppenhaver maneuvers for top position, though. Koppenhaver lands a series of blows and may have opened another cut. The pace slows, and the ref stands them again. Koppenhaver shoots, but Rollins lands a big knee to the face and a right hook that forces Koppenhaver to collapse. Somehow, Koppenhaver reverses the position, takes mount position, and rains down a series of blows that daze Rollins. The ref is forced to stop it. An amazing comeback for Koppenhaver to pull out the bloody win. John Koppenhaver def. Jared Rollins via TKO (strikes) at 2:01 of round three.

MAC DANZIG VS. TOMMY SPEER

Round 1 — An early clinch allows Speer to keep Danzig pinned against the fence, but Danzig powers through his bigger opponent for the takedown. Danzig takes the mount position and rains down a combination of punches. Speer tries to roll out of it, but Danzig takes his back and looks for the choke. Danzig flattens him out with a body triangle, and Speer is finally forced to tap. It’s a quick and surprising submission victory for Danzig. Mac Danzig def. Tommy Speer via submission (rear-naked choke) at 2:01 of the first round.

*** Mac Danzig is the lightweight winner of “The Ultimate Fighter: Team Hughes vs. Team Serra.”***

CLAY GUIDA VS. ROGER HUERTA

Round 1 — Guida scores the first takedown via single-leg, but Huerta gets back to his feet. However, Guida scores a big slam to return the fight to the mat. Guida moves into sidemount, but Herta roles free and grabs a leg looking for a submission. Guida takes Huerta’s back in the process, but Huerta reverses the position and tags Guida with a knee to the face. Seconds later, Guida responds with his own knee to the face, it’s an illegal blow because Huerta had a knee on the ground. After a brief stop in the action, Huerta says he’s OK and comes out swinging and lands a body kick. A brief scramble on the mat allows Guida to take Huerta’s back and lock in his hooks. Guida works for the rear-naked choke, but Huerta breaks free. The round concludes with Huerta looking for an arm-bar. It’s an exciting first round and hard to call. I give it to Guida 10-9.

Round 2 — They go toe-to-toe to start the round before Guida scoops up Huerta for the double-leg takedown. Guida waits for Huerta to get up from the mat to land a knee but eats an uppercut instead. Back on their feet, Huerta works a variety of kicks and snaps his opponent with a leg kick. Guida, though, scores another takedown and works from inside Huerta’s guard. Huerta tries to kick himself free, but Guida takes his opponent’s back momentarily. Back to their feet, they trade shots again, and both fighters land combinations. Guida gets the better of it and scores the takedown and rains down a barrage of hammerfists. Back to their feet, and Huerta lands a combination. Guida fakes a shoot, Huerta drops to his knees, and then eats a back right hook that temporarily dazes the fighter. Guida smells blood and works from top position now and lands some additional hammerfists. The round ends, and it’s a clear 10-9 frame for Guida.

Round 3 — They again trade shots to start the round, and Guida eats two big knees and then an uppercut. Guida looks rocked, falls to the mat and gives up his back. Huerta sinks in the rear-naked choke. Guida tries to hang on but is eventually forced to tap. Roger Huerta def. Clay Guida via submission (rear-naked choke) at 0:51 of the third round.

Details

Minutes of silence´-or-prayer to be held worldwide to honour the victims of the humanitarian tragedy unfolding on the shores of Europe and elsewhere. Those paying their respects will be thinking particularly of Aylan Kurdi, his brother Galip Kurdi, their mother Rehan Kurdi and their loved-ones.

Time: 4 September 2015 at

8 PM CET7 GMT2 PM ET10 PM Kobane time

DI Media Committee said the decision to organise a moment of silence´-or-prayer was taken after requests poured in to DI President, Dr Widad Akrawi, on twitter and other social networks.

What can be saidWords disappear as pain and grief take holdTears come rushing and there is no solace

What has become of usWe have become blind to the fact that Aylan was our sonMillions of children and youth across the world who suffer unspeakable injustices are all our childrenUntil we realize this there will be no peace

We never knew AylanSo why do we cry?Because he is part of usPart of us that died

Dear Aylan

Wherever you areHave no doubtLike the sunWe will riseTo reclaim our humanity

In loving peace

Gal

Emotional Statement by Mr. Zar Ali khan Afridi, DI representative in Pakistan and executive -dir-ector of Society for Rights and Development

Aylan my sweet child. You are not dead. You are ing. You have gone to heaven. My God when I look at you my own son who is of same age just comes and stands before me. I have same sentiments for your brother who is not seen here but I have same feeling for him too. Your Mom who is also no more with you here but she is with you both in heaven I have same sentiments for her as well. Today all day long and to night I have lost no moment to forget what happened with you. You made me speechless like million of people. I am unable to share your picture of with my wife´-or-child who is of your same age. I am sure my wife will be half dead if she sees you. My child more and more. Your is a slap on the face of humanity in general and so called Arab and Muslim Ummah if any in particular. I can not do any thing more except shedding few tears for you all three. Pl accept my flowers wreath for you and your brother and sweet Mom. The more I see you the more I lose my heart.

Child we as adult human beings are very much ashamed before you for not protecting you. You’re lying in such an innocent posture does ask us question which we are unable to answer. My toddler you better go to heaven to be sheltered from brutalities of the terrorists.

Background

The two boys: Aylan Kurdi (three-year-old) and Galip Kurdi (five-year-old) were refugees from Kobane trying to resettle in Canada. When their family lost hope of a new life in Vancouver, they attempted to reach the Greek island of Kos. Their journey ended when their boat overturned due to high waves, leaving their lifeless bodies along with that of their mother Rehan and those of eight other refugees washed up on a Turkish beach of the Bodrum peninsula Wednesday. Their father survived and his only wish now is to return to Kobane with his dead wife and children to bury them.

This family’s tragedy encapsulates the challenges refugees are facing to flee armed conflicts in their countries. According to the UN refugee agency, Wednesday’s dead were part of a grim toll of nearly 2,500 people who have died this summer attempting to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. It is estimated that around 205,000 refugees have entered Greece this year alone.

Key Messages on behalf of Defend International

DI President, Dr. Widad Akrawi, today expressed condolences on behalf of Defend International to the families and friends of victims. Dr. Akrawi stated: “Our heartfelt sympathy goes to the families and friends of those who have died and all refugees and their loved ones. Our thoughts are with them as they mourn the passing of those they loved.” Dr. Akrawi thanked volunteers and humanitarian workers worldwide for their outstanding efforts in aiding desperate refugees. She called on the international community to share equitably the responsibility for protecting, assisting and hosting refugees in accordance with principles of international solidarity and human rights.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Those Wordy Samuelses Strike Again

My father, Jon Samuels, has recently published an essay at the PublicEducation.org site. In it he draws upon the observations of early America made by Alexis de Tocqueville, who suggested that the new nation's prosperity could be attributed in considerable part to its disdain for class strictures, its support for free movement within the country, and its acceptance of broad public education:

Writing today, de Tocqueville might note the erosion of our public schools and the roles played in that by racism, failed discipline, missing parents, rote teaching and testing gone berserk. But, he would be confident in our defense of public education. He would argue that it was not within the American character to shrink in the face of challenge. He would expect that we would tax ourselves sufficiently to provide for the common educational good.

He would not be surprised when we raised the station of our teachers. He would anticipate our solution of the dropout problem and our reinstitution of discipline and mutual respect in our schools. He would expect that we would use tests surgically to expand an improved curriculum.

He concludes:

I do not support any “choice” that would further impoverish our public school system, that, however unintentional, could result in a few fleeing the problems that affect the many, that could create educational slums to warehouse an overwhelmingly poor and minority population. That would not be the America that enthralled de Tocqueville . . . .

I am sure that those who disagree with me are acting out of the courage of their convictions. I would ask, however, that they also have the courage of the consequences of their convictions.

When it comes to public education concerns, I suspect that there's some daylight between our respective positions, but I respect his willingness, as a board member of Public Education Partners, a local education foundation in Aiken, South Carolina, to tackle difficult issues that have stymied many, many others. After years as a career military officer and a successful businessman, I'm proud that he's brought his considerable skills to bear on a topic of such pressing public concern.

Mon, 27 Jun 2011 13:48:06 +0000http://conservativedailynews.com/?p=13656#comment-5120I spent the evening of 20 May 2011 with Ms. Thomas and some of our conversation follows:

During my conversation with Ms. Thomas I filled her in on my distress over Amy Goodman’s failure to follow up on her 2004 interview with Mordechai Vanunu which resulted in his being sentenced to 6 months in jail in 2007 and then enduring 78 days back in solitary in 2010, just because he dared to speak to foreign media after he was released from 18 years in jail for telling the truth and providing the photographic proof of Israel’s WMD Program.

In April 2007, I had lunch with Amy Goodman-not because we have ever been friends, but only because I had once been a generous donor to Democracy NOW! was I invited to have lunch with Amy.

I accepted the invitation only so I could fill Amy in on the fact that her 2004 interview with Vanunu was major testimony against him in his FREEDOM of SPEECH trial-which began the same day Hamas was democratically elected on 25 January 2006- and also to ask her to follow up asap!

Amy acted interested and jotted down notes in her Blackberry, but she didn’t bother to call Vanunu until July 2007 after he was sentenced to 6 more months in jail essentially for speaking to foreign media in 2004!

Vanunu refused to speak to Amy because she –like all THE MEDIA-hadn’t done anything to raise awareness about Israel’s continuing persecution of him and to this day Vanunu is still waiting for his inalienable right to leave Tel Aviv and fly to freedom.

After I filled Ms. Thomas in on my anger with Amy she replied, “She used to be better.”

I then brought up Ms. Thomas’s first and last question to President Obama regarding Middle East nuclear weapons when he blew her off claiming he didn’t want to ‘speculate’ and her ‘peers’ remained mute, although the State Department has reams of documentation about Israel’s WMD.

Ms. Thomas replied, “They have no conscience.”

I also claim their lack of integrity borders on treason!

I was not a reporter when I met Vanunu for the first time in June 2005, but I knew I had to become one when he told me:

“Did you know that President Kennedy tried to stop Israel from building atomic weapons? In 1963, he forced Prime Minister Ben Guirion to admit the Dimona was not a textile plant, as the sign outside proclaimed, but a nuclear plant. The Prime Minister said, ‘The nuclear reactor is only for peace.’

“Kennedy insisted on an open internal inspection. He wrote letters demanding that Ben Guirion open up the Dimona for inspection.

“The French were responsible for the actual building of the Dimona. The Germans gave the money; they were feeling guilty for the Holocaust, and tried to pay their way out. Everything inside was written in French, when I was there, almost twenty years ago. Back then, the Dimona descended seven floors underground.

“In 1955, Perez and Guirion met with the French to agree they would get a nuclear reactor if they fought against Egypt to control the Sinai and Suez Canal. That was the war of 1956. Eisenhower demanded that Israel leave the Sinai, but the reactor plant deal continued on.

“When Johnson became president, he made an agreement with Israel that two senators would come every year to inspect. Before the senators would visit, the Israelis would build a wall to block the underground elevators and stairways. From 1963 to ’69, the senators came, but they never knew about the wall that hid the rest of the Dimona from them.

“Nixon stopped the inspections and agreed to ignore the situation. As a result, Israel increased production. In 1986, there were over two hundred bombs. Today, they may have enough plutonium for ten bombs a year.”

After cheese cake for desert I asked Ms. Thomas what she would advise anyone who wanted to go into the field of journalism and she stated:

“Go for it! It’s the greatest profession in the world because you are always learning and you are aware of the world, so you just might be able to affect change.

“You cannot have a democracy without an informed people.

“Information is everything; it enlarges your intellect and that guides you.

“The job is to follow the truth and report where it leads you!

“Right and wrong is not relative. Empathy is fine but kindness and sympathy do not change the facts and conscience is everything!

“Leaders are suppose to do the right thing and we should back up the president when he does the right thing; but drop him when he doesn’t.

“The WHY is the most important question-not that something happened- but WHY did it happen?

“Somewhere along the way America lost its soul.

“People have to rise up but Americans have become so passive and power overwhelmingly abusive.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Addressing mediapersons here, he said the BJP was even willing for the preponement of elections in case the Congress party felt that it would not be feasible to hold elections at higher altitudes of the state in December.

Mr Dhumal said the government's request of postponing of elections on the plea that the school education board had decided to hold examinations from December two to 12 only reflected the ''perturbed mindset'' of the Congress leadership.

Examination dates could always be changed to suit the interests of the students and the people of the state, he said.

The BJP leader the party had lodged a complaint with the EC for getting a few deputy commissioners, SPs and some other key state government officials, who were working as stooges of the ruling party, transferred.

"(Closed) Sometimes it makes sense

After freaking out for months about things with career and relationship, last night was a moment of clarity.

My job that I had loved dearly moved out of state 3 months ago, and I chose to go back to another less fullfilling position at my company instead of following the job I loved. I did so because of Mr. Tri… He had stated that he wouldn’t EVER move to this location, so I knew that I would have to choose . Pay etc wasn’t a factor in this choice so…it was basically me choosing between career and relationship. I chose relationship. Let me preface this with the fact that I have done this before in a previous relationship that literally blew up on me and sent my life into a complete tailspin and overhaul, so doing this scared me a ton.

For the last 3 months I have been questioning my move a lot… wondering if Mr Tri felt the same way about me as I did him. Half worrying that I was replaying mistakes in my head.

But last night all of the little blocks aligned to make sense of a lot of mixed emotions and worries… all thanks to Mr Tri’s cousin

Mr Tri has been consumed by $$ for about the last 6 months, and I couldn’t quite figure it out, was it a sense of accomplishment was it a feeling of being good enough, I just didn’t get it. He’s been crazy about his debt and his career to the point of annoying on occasion. But now I know why

Last night while at a concert ( his bday present from me) his cousin asked me what the deal was with us and when we were going to get engaged… I danced around the question and decided to use it as ammo for questions later. I needed to put my worries to rest once and for all… they were eating at me…

So last night I got some guts and told him what his cousin asked, and I got the answer of when I have enough money, followed by a joking comment in regards to the fact that he would have to propose with a lifesaver right now…

Although I’d be happy with that or a twist tie, I will wait happily… I know tha the wants to marry me and right now, that is enough.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"MIT Blackjack Team

“The first year I played, we returned 154 percent to our investors. That’s after paying off expenses. You try and do that on Wall Street.” – Jeff Ma, member of the MIT Blackjack Team.

How did a bunch of college kids from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University become the most feared blackjack team on earth in the 1980’s and ’90’s? Individual players on that blackjack card counting squad routinely made $100,000 to $180,000 per session in profits, and Las Vegas treated them like royalty. That is, until they found out these fresh faced blackjack bandits were using an intricate card counting system and confederates to uncover the most favorable circumstances for a big bet. While blackjack card counting itself by using your brain is not illegal, the MIT team which has been the subject of films like the documentary “Breaking Vegas” and the more recent Hollywood production “21” sometimes went above and beyond simply using great math skills, and paid the price. But not until after winning tens of millions of dollars at blackjack and bringing Vegas to its knees.

And if you think the claims above made by Jeff Ma of 154% returns are a little outlandish, they actually started off much better than that. Bill Kaplan is a 1980 Harvard MBA graduate who had run a very successful blackjack team out of Las Vegas in the late 1970’s, and in 1977 used a blackjack card counting strategy to generate a 35X rate of return over a nine-month period (that’s turning $1,000 into $36,000 in 9 months). In 1980, Kaplan headed up a team of MIT and Harvard students that hit Las Vegas using formal management procedures and approaching a blackjack card counting and betting system as a business. On August 1, 1980 that original MIT team began with a stake of $89,000, with player names like Massar, Jonathan, Goose, and Big Dave doubling the original stakes in less than 10 weeks. An investor prospectus had estimated profits of $170 per hour, and actual play delivered realized profits of $162.50 per hour. Mostly undergraduates, the MIT team, as it came to be known, earned across-the-board an average of over $80 an hour while investors enjoyed annualized profits of 250%.

All this while Las Vegas showered the young players with free rooms, lavish suites and other Sin City comps. Andy Bloch, now a professional poker player that holds two electrical engineering degrees from MIT and a Juris Doctorate from Harvard Law School, was one of the MIT blackjack members. He has claimed “tens of millions” of dollars won by his fellow teammates and subsequent team members, and it is hard to argue with that estimate. And all those millions started to draw attention. Henry Houh, at the time a grad student at MIT, noticed his office-mate lugging around thousands of dollars of casino chips at work. Saddled with massive debt, he eagerly joined the card counting team, stating, “It was great fun.” With plenty of “crazy stories” of partying and staying in $1,000 a night suites complements of Las Vegas casinos, Houh also said that the MIT blackjack team was the reason it took him 13 years to finish school.

But these brilliant blackjack brains did not simply decide to get together and then hit Las Vegas. The mysterious Mister M and Kaplan put potential blackjack team candidates through grueling training sessions. A fully trained card counter then had to undergo a “trial by fire” final exam by playing through 8 six-deck shoes without mistakes, all while being lambasted with loud noises, music and other distractions typical to the average casino. Players learned to stagger their betting patterns as to disguise the fact that they were counting cards and waiting for the perfect scenario. They would then make a massive bet when they had an extreme advantage, and while losses naturally occurred, the profits were far greater. Advanced techniques like ace tracking and shuffle tracking were also employed, but John Chang, an MIT undergraduate that joined the team in late 1980, stated that the most consistent profits came from straight blackjack card counting.

Playing throughout the ’80s, and growing to as many as 35 players in 1984, a full 22 different partnerships composed MIT blackjack teams from 1979 through 1989. A total of 70 people played at one time or another in some capacity, either as card counters, “Big Players”, or in other supporting roles. Many times a player would count cards at a blackjack table while placing small bets without wavering his play. When the table was right for the picking, that player would signal someone sitting at a nearby bar or appearing to simply be watching, and that Big Player would swoop into the table for a single large bet, collect and leave. Incredibly enough, every single MIT blackjack team was successful during that tenure, paying in some cases over 300% per year to investors. In 1992 and ’93, MIT blackjack team members Bill Kaplan, J.P. Massar and John Chang formed Strategic Investments as a limited partnership to run the blackjack card counting enterprise. Through the early and mid-90s, the MIT team grew to nearly 80 players, with 30 players playing simultaneously at different casinos around the world. While blackjack teams consistently come and go, the MIT blackjack card counting team of the 1980s and ’90s will always live on in memory as one of the most brash and successful blackjack teams of all-time.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Networks, Movements and Technopolitics in Latin America

About this book:

This edited collection presents original and compelling research about contemporary experiences of Latin American movements and politics in several countries. The book proposes a theoretical framework that conceptualises different mediation processes that emerge between cyberdemocracy and the emancipation practices of new social movements. Additionally, this volume presents some Latin American practices and experiences that are autonomously and by using self-management–creating other identities and social spaces on the margins of and against the neoliberal system through the use of digital technology. This book will be of great interest to scholars of media and social movements studies as well as of contemporary politics.

"The
immune system has the peculiar ability to respond to foreign substances
(or antigens) by producing antibody molecules that bind to these
antigens with extremely high affinity and a remarkable degree of
specificity. In order to achieve this high level of affinity, B cells –
the cells that produce antibodies – must undergo a series of steps that
culminate in the generation of an anatomical structure known as the
germinal center (GC). Within this structure, B cells introduce random
mutations into their antibody genes and, in a process reminiscent of
Darwinian evolution, B cells that have acquired affinity-enhancing
mutations proliferate, and are eventually directed to differentiate
into antibody-producing plasma cells or memory cells that can re-expand
upon future contact with the same antigen.

A germinal center reaction in a lymph node
of an
immunized mouse. It is within this structure that B cells mutate their
antibody genes, in a process that ultimately leads to the generation of
high-affinity antibodies.

It is this process that
allows vaccines to work, and that makes us immune to catching certain
diseases more than once. On the flip side, failures in the GC reaction
can result in the production of high- affinity antibodies against
innocuous substances or even components of one’s own body – leading to
allergies and autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis. Furthermore, when misplaced the mutations introduced during
the GC reaction can cause genetic lesions that may ultimately lead to
lymphomas and other malignancies.

In the Victora lab, we combine
a number of cutting-edge techniques – from the development of novel
mouse models to intravital multiphoton microscopy – to shed light on
the intricacies of the GC reaction and its regulation. For example,
using multiphoton-based geotagging of GC cells in a newly developed
photoactivatable mouse, we have been able to define the cellular and
molecular characteristics of different subpopulations of GC B cells, as
well as their dynamic behavior and its relationship to selection. The
characteristics we defined in mice are now being used in human studies
to better understand the events leading to B cell lymphoma. We believe
that unveiling the molecular mechanisms of the GC reaction will be
essential if we wish to design better vaccines, develop treatments for
allergies and autoimmune diseases, and dissect the molecular basis of
lymphomagenesis.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"For the most part, the Broncos are finished with phase one of free agency.

Getting a newly restructured/reduced contract with pass-rushing defensive end Elvis Dumervil is their final piece of business before owner Pat Bowlen, president Joe Ellis, front-office boss John Elway and coach John Fox take off Sunday for the NFL owners meetings in Scottsdale, Ariz.

Otherwise, the Broncos as they stand now are pretty much tapped out of salary-cap room, according to two NFL sources. They are roughly $50,000 to $52,000 below league-imposed $123 million payroll limit.

This is not a surprise given their furious attack on the open market through the first two days.

Add in the re-signings of special-teams standout David Bruton and starting defensive tackle Kevin Vickerson, plus the franchise tag placed on starting left tackle Ryan Clady, and the Broncos have made $63.5 million worth of financial commitments to eight free-agent players.

Those eight players will be paid a collective $30 million this year.

The Broncos are likely to use the draft to select a running back, probably within the first three rounds. Maybe even in the first round.

They wanted to add a safety to compete with Rahim Moore, Mike Adams and Quinton Carter. Maybe later.

They will have to pick up a No. 3 and No. 4 quarterback by training camp. This team is solid at the first two spots with Peyton Manning, who will turn 37 in 10 days, and Brock Osweiler, who is barely 22.

Otherwise, the Broncos want to make sure they are not left with a gaping hole opposite Von Miller at right end. Dumervil is scheduled to make $12 million this year, after he made $14 million in each of the past two years.

The Broncos want him to take a pay cut to a salary more in line with the adjusted pass-rusher market. Paul Kruger's new deal averaged $8 million a year. He has only 15 ½ sacks in his career. Dumervil had 17 in 2009 alone.

Yet, Cliff Avril had 20 ½ sacks the past two seasons, the number Dumervil has had. He got $7.5 million a year. There is a case that can be argued for both sides.

The Broncos are willing to add back some of their proposed reduction in the form of guaranteed dollars in the later years of Dumervil's contract. His current deal calls for an non-guaranteed $10 million in 2014 and $8 million in 2015.

In some ways, the Broncos and Dumervil's agent Marty Magid are not far apart. In other ways, they are not close. The Broncos have a backup plan if they can't work out a deal with Dumervil by Friday, the day before his $12 million salary would become fully guaranteed. Dwight Freeney is one possibility, but there are other defensive-end candidates the Broncos would consider.

"I'm not exactly sue how the whole familiar movement thing goes, but we have always played that if you move the familiar can move along with you. But now I am getting zephyr boots and I wanted to know if my floating weapon familiar can fly along with me. Also I have a winged shield, will hat float up with me also?

if your fam is on passive mode it is part of you can goes where u go. But if it is active it only moves when you move it via a move action (so moves instead of you) and it moves based on its move speed and type.

That doens't make any sense. If a familiar can't be more than so many squares from you that would mean you would have to walk only every other round, essentially half speed in order for it to keep up.

It may not make sense but it's the rules. There is a feat that specifically allows your active familiar to move when you take a move action named Active Familiar. There is also another feat that lets you move your familiar with a minor action 1/turn, Quick Familiar. So without those, either you move, or your familiar moves, but not both. On a side note, ""keeping up"" isn't really a concern because for overland movement you can just put it in passive mode to stay with you, and in combat it's unlikely for the range to be an issue.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"It’s hard to get into the world of the Internet of Things (IoT) without eventually talking about Digital Twins. I was first exposed to the concept of Digital Twins when working with GE. Great concept. But are Digital Twins only relevant to physical machines such as wind turbines, jet engines, and locomotives? What can we learn about the concept of digital twins that we can apply more broadly – to other physical entities (like contracts and agreements) and even humans?

What Is a Digital Twin?A Digital Twin is a digital representation of an industrial asset that enables companies to better understand and predict the performance of their machines, find new revenue streams, and change the way their business operates[1].

GE uses the concept of Digital Twins to create a digital replica of their physical product (e.g., wind turbine, jet engine, locomotive) that captures the asset’s detailed history (from design to build to maintenance to retirement/salvage) that can be mined to provide actionable insights into the product’s operations, maintenance and performance.

The Digital Twin concept seems to work for any entity around which there is ongoing activity or “life”; that is, there is a continuous flow of new information about that entity that can constantly update the condition or “state” of that entity.

The Digital Twin concept is so powerful that it would be a shame to not apply the concept beyond just physical products. So let’s try to apply the Digital Twin concept to another type of common physical entity – contracts or agreements.

Applying Digital Twins to ContractsMany contracts and agreements have a life of their own; they are not just static entities. Many contracts (e.g., warranties, health insurance, automobile insurance, car rental agreements, construction contracts, apartment rental agreements, leasing agreements, personal loans, line of credit, maintenance contracts) once established, have a stream of ongoing interactions, changes, enhancements, additions, enforcements and filings. In fact, the very process of establishing a contract can constitute many interactions with exchanges of information (negotiations) that shape the coverage, agreement, responsibilities and expectations of the contract.

Let’s take a simple home insurance contract. Once the contract is established, there is a steady stream of interactions and enhancements to that contract including:

Payments

Addendums

Claims filings

Changes in terms and conditions

Changes in coverage

Changes in deductibles

Each of these engagements changes the nature of the contract including its value and potential liabilities. The insurance contract looks like a Digital Twin of the physical property for which it insures given the cumulative history of the interactions with and around that contract.

Expanding upon the house insurance contract as a living entity, the insurance company might want to gather other data about the property in order to increase the value of the contract while reducing the contract’s risks, liabilities and obligations. Other data sources that the insurance company might want to integrate with the house insurance contract could include:

Changes in the value of the home (as measured by Zillow and others)

Changes in the value of the nearby homes

Changes in local crime

Changes in local traffic

Changes in the credentials and quality of local schools

Quality of nearby parks

Changes in zoning (the value and liabilities of a house could change if someone constructs a mall nearby)

Changes in utilities (a house with lots of grass might not be as attractive as the price of water starts to increase)

If the goal of the insurance company holding the home insurance policy is to 1) maximize the value of that policy while 2) reducing any potential costs, liabilities and obligations, then creating a Digital Twin via a home insurance contract seems like a smart economic move.

Applying Digital Twins to Humans“Big Data is not about big data; it’s about getting down to the individual!”

One of the keys to data monetization is to understand the behaviors and tendencies of each individual including consumers, students, teachers, patients, doctors, nurses, engineers, technicians, agents, brokers, store managers, baristas, clerks, and athletes. In order to better serve your customers, you need to capture and quantify each individual customer’s preferences, behaviors, tendencies, inclinations, interests, passions, associations and affiliations in the form of actionable insights (such as propensity scores). See Figure 3.

Figure 3: Big Data About Insights at Level of the Individual

These actionable insights can be captured in an Analytic Profile for re-use across a number of use cases including customer acquisition, retention, cross-sell/up-selling, fraud reduction, money laundering, advocacy development and likelihood to recommend (see Figure 3).

SummaryGE uses the concept of Digital Twins to create a digital replica of a physical product that captures the asset’s detailed history (from design to build to maintenance to retirement/salvage) that can be mined to provide actionable insights into the product’s operations, maintenance and performance.

That same Digital Twins concept can be applied to contracts and agreements in order to increase the value of those contracts while minimizing any potential risks and liabilities. And the Digital Twins concept can also be applied to humans in order to better monetize the individual human (customers) across the organization’s value creation process.

“It’s a simple idea that looks really wacky,” Jordan admits. “But it does have a sound basis in animal behavior theory.”

The question is whether lions can be fooled by this same trick. Jordan suspects that they can, especially since lions tend to stalk their prey, and only pounce when an unsuspecting antelope or cow lets down its guard. “Lions are supreme ambush predators—they rely on stealth,” Jordan says in the video. “When seen, they lose this element of surprise and abandon their hunt.” In theory, farmers could protect their cattle by, you guessed it, painting eyes on the cows’ butts so that even when their backs are turned, they appear to be staring at the lions.

With their butts.

At least one small-scale study has already shown promising results.

Dr Jordan’s idea of painting eyes onto cattle rumps came about after two lionesses were killed near the village in Botswana where he was based. While watching a lion hunt an impala, he noticed something interesting: “Lions are ambush hunters, so they creep up on their prey, get close and jump on them unseen. But in this case, the impala noticed the lion. And when the lion realized it had been spotted, it gave up on the hunt,” he says.

In nature, being ‘seen’ can deter predation. For example, patterns resembling eyes on butterfly wings are known to deter birds. In India, woodcutters in the forest have long worn masks on the back of their heads to ward-off man-eating tigers.

Jordan’s idea was to “hijack this mechanism” of psychological trickery. Last year, he collaborated with the BPCT and a local farmer to trial the innovative strategy, which he’s dubbed “iCow”.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

“The police must not be seen to be an institution that just protects the government. The police is an institution that serves all citizens and implements lawful orders and norms. We have to be answerable to the government. We have to be accountable to the parliament”.

Riyaz stated that, when he had assumed responsibilities of the police commissioner on the night of February 8, 2012, the police leadership of the time had “failed and hence, people’s perceptions of the police had completely changed”.

He asserted that one of his first objectives after assuming the post was to ensure that the police was freed from all external influences and went back to working independently and professionally.

Riyaz further stated that police had remained steadfast in the face of wrongful allegations and perceptions of their work, while emphasizing that during his time as commissioner he had “never made a decision or issued an order with the intention of inflicting harm or harassment to any specific individual”.

“When Amnesty International released a report with false statements against us, I personally made a phone call to their president. In response to every one of these statements, we sent a statement clarifying the truth of the matter.”

“When I first took up the post, I was reluctant to even claim my pay as there was so much murder being committed. However, due to the work done unitedly, god willing we haven’t seen a major death this year,” Riyaz said.

February, 2012

Riyaz spoke in detail about his role in the controversial transfer of power on February 7, 2012.

The retired commissioner – who had at the time been relieved of his duties as a police officer – stated on Monday night that he had gone there on the day with “good intentions because [he] could not bear to sit home and watch the situation the police and soldiers were in”.

He added that he had contacted both the current Defence Minister Mohamed Nazim and former Deputy Minister of Home Affairs Mohamed Fayaz via phone prior to going there.

Stating that he had prioritized national interest above all, Riyaz claimed that he had accepted the post of police commissioner because his country needed him.

“Police were desiring a leadership that would not issue unlawful orders. Many asked me why I was going back to this institution, including my wife. But I decided that I cannot turn my back to the nation at the time it needed me most.”

Riyaz ended his speech by “seeking forgiveness from any police officer of citizen I may have inconvenienced during my time as commissioner of police”.

“Although I am leaving behind life as a police officer and entering politics, I will always defend this institution. There is no institution I can love as much as I do the police.”

He added that Vice Presidentv Dr Mohamed Jameel Ahmed had been the first to advise him to enter the political arena.

Appreciation from the state

“The happiest day that I have come across so far is the day when a new president was elected on November 16, the second round of the presidential election. What made me happiest about it is that we were assured that a government has been established which will not undermine or disrespect important state institutions like the police, the military, the judiciary and other entities,” he said.

“And that this is a government which will protect the religious unity of this nation and ensure that expensive state assets are not sold out to foreign companies,” he continued.

“The fact that Maldivian citizens voted in a Jumhooree Party and Progressive Party of Maldives government proves that the events that happened on February 7 [2012] was not a coup d’etat,” he stated.

Other speakers at the event, including Vice President Jameel, Home Minister Umar Naseer and current Police Commissioner Hussain Waheed commended Riyaz for his work.

Home Minister Umar described Riyaz as an assertive and sharp-minded officer who had brought commendable development to the institution.

Current Commissioner of Police Hussain Waheed stated that Riyaz had stood up to defend the police institution even when faced with “immense pressure, criticism and threats against [police officers’] families”.

“Even as police were referred to with various hateful names, and even some officers’ lives were taken, our brother Riyaz was working tirelessly in our defence.”

There used to be an old British Sit Com, 'It ain't half hot mum', the theme tune was, 'the boys to entertain you'. A bit like The Maldives now, all very entertaining, except of course if you support the MDP.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Pharmacokinetics and Indications: Stanozolol is a synthetic anabolic steroid approved by FDA for human use. It is derived from testosterone. Stanozolol has large oral bioavailability because it survives through liver metabolism and therefore available in tablet form. It does not produce estrogen as end product. Stanozolol is popular in female bodybuilders because of its large anabolic effect and weak androgenic effects; however virilisation and masculinization are most common side effects. Stanozolol is banned from use in sports competitions by IAAF and many other sporting bodies. Stanozolol is popular in bodybuilders because of its anabolic effects also because it tends to retain lean body mass without any water retention and weight gain. Stanazolol is also thought to be a fat burning drug, however there is very little evidence supporting this. It is used by bodybuilders for anabolic effects to enhance the masculine appearance. Clinically it has been used to treat anemia and hereditary angioedema in humans with remarkable success and is very popular among most of the physicians. In veterinary it has been used in weak animals to increase body mass, improve blood counts and appetite. Stanozolol has also been used in horse racing to give a metabolic assist during the preparation of the competition. Stanozolol is normally presented as 5 mg tablets. The dosage is 10-25 mg/day with optimal results at 50 mg/day.

Possible Side Effects: The effects of this drug are not permanent and only last as long as one keeps taking it in regular dosage. As soon as the intake stops body mass decreases rapidly. Possible side effects of Stanozolol are insomnia, depression, jaundice which can be serious, nausea and vomiting, gynocomastia, male pattern baldness and deepening of voice.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Norms Matter

The calls for Donald Trump to releasehis tax returns beganearly during the campaign and never really let up. It was easy to assume he eventually would make good on his promises to turn them over. Every president since Jimmy Carter had released his taxes; Trump would have to do the same, right?

What we’ve learned since then, of course, is that Trump didn’t have to reveal anything. The Constitution doesn’t require disclosure; plenty of federal officials need to submit their tax returns to the Senate, but not the president. It’s just a norm.

Story Continued Below

One of the crucial lessons of the past year, turns out, is just how much of American politics is governed not by written law, but by norms like these. For instance, the president isn’t required to divest himself of his businesses, but previous occupants of the White House have followed this tradition. Carter even put his peanut farm into a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest. By contrast, Trump handed the reins to his sons, maintaining the rights to directly extract profits from the trust that controls his business empire. It’s not illegal, but before this year, it was a line no modern president had crossed.

Social scientists have long understood the importance of norms—the unwritten rules and conventions that shape political behavior—but our political system has largely taken them for granted. As a result, we have been slow to recognize how vulnerable these informal constraints on power are to someone who refuses to follow rules that everyone else respects.

Trump’s assault on norms started during the campaign, when he encouraged violence among his supporters, attacked the ethnicity of a federal judge (a double norm violation) and called for the imprisonment of his opponent. Once he was elected, many observers assumed this pattern would cease: Surely there are constraints on this kind of behavior from the president.

There aren’t—or, at least, there are few formal ones. Many of Trump’s statements and behavior have no precedent in recent history, but they aren’t illegal. He openly admitted to firing James Comey as FBI director because of Comey’s investigation into Russian influence in Trump’s campaign—probably a legal act, but a violation of long-respected norms against political influence in the Justice Department. Similarly, Trump continues to visit and promote his businesses while in office, which would be prohibited for a Cabinet secretary, but is legal for the president. White House jobs for his children? Directly attacking the press? Railing about politics to military service members under his command? These were red lines so strong that they seemed to have the force of law, but no longer.

We normally count on politicians to restrain themselves out of fear of public consequences. But as Trump’s election showed, the polarization and partisanship of our era has weakened those guardrails. Democrats are sounding the alarm, but members of his own party have remained largely silent. Violating norms is part of Trump’s appeal to his core supporters. As a result, these violations are frequently dismissed as just another case of partisan disagreement. Boundaries on presidential behavior that both parties have previously respected are blurring, making further abuses all too easy to imagine.

Directly attacking the press? Railing about politics to military service members? These were red lines so strong that they seemed to have the force of law, but no longer.

Internal checks, too, have withered. The Office of Government Ethics previously relied on voluntary compliance from officials who served under past presidents, including both Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Under Trump, however, this norm, too, has been breached with little cost to the president or his appointees. Walter Shaub, the head of OGE, recently stepped down, frustrated at his ineffectiveness during the Trump administration. Shaub told the New Yorker, “To have OGE criticize you would have been a career-ender in the olden days—now it’s just lost in the noise.”

What happens when norms are shattered like this? One response is to write them into law. After Watergate, Congress created an independent special prosecutor role to guard against interference in investigations of the executive branch, and strengthened campaign finance regulations in response to abuses during the 1972 election. Similarly, after Franklin D. Roosevelt broke George Washington’s precedent of serving only two terms, the Constitution was amended to formally limit the length of a presidency. After Trump, Congress could well take similar steps like requiring presidential tax disclosures, strengthening conflict-of-interest protections and increasing independent legal authority over the executive branch.

Such laws will never be sufficient, however. As political scientists have long known, there is no way to formally prohibit every type of bad behavior in advance. Who could have anticipated that it might be necessary to criminalize collusion with a hostile foreign power on the release of hacked emails?

Ultimately, our country must therefore also rebuild respect for the informal rules of our political system. The fact that presidents have long separated business and politics voluntarily was a measure of how seriously they—and we—took the public trust. These conventions of behavior were virtually invisible to us precisely because so many public officials dutifully followed them, until now. As we have seen, these norms might be a fragile bulwark against a demagogue, but they also reflect a commitment to a set of shared rules and values that is an important indicator of the health of our politics. Without that commitment, preserving our freedoms will become a much more difficult and dangerous task.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Beijing - Artprice's Chairman, thierry Ehrmann, and its senior executives have just returned from several days of intense work at Artron's headquarters in Beijing where discussions focused on accelerating and implementing, as quickly as possible, all the agreed strategic and commercial initiatives that will inevitably generate very positive results in terms of turnover and the expansion of Artprice's client base... not to mention shareholder value.

Artron and its Chairman Mr. Wan Jie gave the Artprice team an exceptionally respectful, warm and loyal welcome and introduced Artprice to China's top-level institutional leaders, the country's principal Art Market players and all of Artron's 3,500 employees.

These face-to-face introductions are an essential step in Artprice's bid to fructify the enormous potential of the Chinese market in a fast and optimal manner.

In 2018, China accounted for 45% of global online transactions, generating 12 times more online transactions than the United States. China has a huge advantage over the West because it is building its market economy directly on the Internet (Source GEAB / LEAP 2020).

Speaking in front of his senior executives and top management, Mr. Wan Jie – at the head of his Artron empire and probably the most powerful player in China's Art Market – reiterated his unfailing personal friendship and loyalty vis-à-vis Artprice's founder-Chairman, thierry Ehrmann.

This fact deserves emphasis as Chinese custom usually prohibits such ‘departures' from accepted business protocol.

As China has become the global Art Market's leading marketplace over the past decade – Artprice had been the first to report it in 2009 –, it naturally represents a fascinating new market for Artprice.

China has grand ambitions:

As the French language business weekly Challenges headlined last week: “China, the giant that wants to dominate the World”. China is still accelerating with its “Made in China 2025” plan and its “New Silk Roads”.

As a global company, Artprice made a point to successfully enter the Chinese market, now the last great ‘eldorado' for any group whose market is global.

According to Artprice's founding Chairman, thierry Ehrmann, “I appreciated the emergence of China's global power, its insatiable appetite and its desire for leadership a long time ago! Over the past nine years, Artprice has translated hundreds of millions of data from its proprietary databases into Mandarin. However, observant visitors to our famous head offices (L'Organe Museum of Contemporary Art at the “Abode of Chaos” [dixit The New York Times]) over the past 30 years will have noticed thousands of artworks – including my own sculptures and paintings – directly or indirectly referring to the ancient culture and history of China.”

“Unlike many, I am not surprised to see China gradually becoming the world's leading economic power. Artprice has decided to enter the Chinese market through the front door with a humility that has clearly been lacking in many Western listed companies. Any other strategy would have been a fatal mistake. I therefore wish to reiterate my thanks to Wan Jie, Artron's Chairman, and all his colleagues for making this open and proper strategy possible after 9 years of close collaboration!”

Thanks to Artron's expert advice, Artprice fully complies with the specifications of China's “Great Electronic Wall” and its terms and conditions: Law CL97 (1997) as well as its “Golden Shield” protocol (1998).

In order to comply with law CL97, Artprice spent two years rewriting all its databank code in order to eliminate all US and European corporate source code containing cookies, tags, metadata, backdoor elements (amongst other elements).

Since Monday morning, Artprice is one of the very few Western companies to possess a WeChat profile reserved for companies operating under Chinese law. WeChat is used by more than 1.8 billion Chinese Internet users around the world.

The statistics concerning China are eye-watering: a population of over 1.4 billion people, 5 times that of the United States, a GDP growth of 6.5% this year and, regarding specifically Artprice, a colossal art market with a massive pool of living artists (1 million in China versus 120,000 for the USA and Europe combined) and an almost infinite number of artworks. China's art market is animated by tens of millions of art buyers, professionals and collectors, many of whom are Artron customers and therefore, going forward, potential customers for Artprice.

The title of Artron's press release: “Artron and Artprice team up to create the art ‘silk road'”, (the ‘silk road' notion is massively used by the Chinese State) makes perfect sense. The New Silk Road is part of China's soft power strategy (OBOR for One Belt, One Road) to conquer the world economically.

China had initiated the project. According to the IMF, the World Bank and the CIA World Factbook, China is the world's leading economic power in terms of GDP-PPP in 2017. According to CNN, this project encompasses 68 countries representing 4.8 billion people and 62% of global GDP.

Artron is a very powerful company and, for those interested in Art or the Art Market, Artron is completely unavoidable in China. Artron is not only the world's leading publisher of Fine Art books and auction catalogues (with more than 400 million books/catalogues printed); it is also a major scientific laboratory – with premises in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen – and a technical and scientific knowledge base that easily rivals that of Silicon Valley.

Its scanning processes in virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality have reached the very highest level of global sophistication and the company's scientific and cultural innovation has been rewarded with more than 800 prizes and awards for excellence.

Artron.Net is the most respected brand in the Chinese art world. It has more than 3 million professional members in the arts sector and an average of 15 million daily visits, making it the world's leading art website. It is the first choice for art professionals, investors / collectors and art lovers. Founded in 1993, the Artron Art Group is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.

The involvement of Artron and its Chairman Mr. Wan Jie in Art in China is completely uncontested. Mr. Wan Jie is a ‘protector' of Beijing's famous 798 Factory which enjoys global visibility and was visited by Artprice staff.

He is also Vice-Chairman and Founder of the Institute of the famous Forbidden City, where he and thierry Ehrmann visited government offices that are closed to the public during the recent trip to Beijing.

The was also an opportunity for Artprice's Chairman thierry Ehrmann to see first-hand Mr. Wan Jie's involvement and support for the protection and diffusion of ancient masterpieces of Chinese art in the Imperial Granaries. These superb works have been “returned to the people” thanks to Artron's scientific breakthroughs and ultra high-speed Internet which allows these masterpieces of humanity to be contemplated in a virtual reality context, with the support of the Chinese State.

During the trip, the Artprice team met some of China's world-renowned artists including Fang Lijun (born in 1963) ranked 623/700,000 in 2018 and Zhang Xiaogang (born in 1958) ranked 121/700,000 artists in 2018 in Artprice's global ranking.

Artprice's press agency, ArtMarketInsight, together with Artron's editors, have decided to post around thirty daily dispatches in both Chinese and English aimed at combining information about the Chinese art market with information about the Western art market.

Our various meetings and visits in Beijing left no doubt in our minds as to the power of China, the extraordinary wealth and depth of its history (over 4,000 years), and the country's incredible advance over the West in terms of technology… a vision and an understanding of China that completely disqualifies the ignorant visions of the Chinese Empire that can still be found in the West to this day.

A geo-cultural analysis is not interested in the percentage of GDP spent on arms, but rather in the depth of the countries' respective histories and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist civilizations.

Among its numerous manifestations, China's ‘soft power' is also focused on the Art Market. In this context, Artron's alliance with Artprice is part of Xi Jinping's “BRI” (belt and road initiative) launched in 2013 (aka the “Silk Road” in Europe). According to CNN, this project encompasses 68 countries representing 4.8 billion people and 62% of global GDP with an investment of close to $8 trillion.

It is therefore a great honour for Artprice to have been chosen by Artron and its Chairman Mr. Wan Jie. Artron appreciates the work conducted by Artprice and has validated its place as World Leader in Art Market Information. That is why Artprice subscriptions will be distributed in China, with a huge potential for new customers. Artprice's data will contribute to the fluidity of the Chinese and, more broadly, the Asian Art Market, in a context where ‘Greater Asia' will account for 70% of the global Art Market by 2019.

According to Artron, Artprice's econometric expertise associated with Artron's proprietary data will not only provide an extraordinary boost to the fluidity of China's Art Market (throughout its numerous provinces and autonomous regions), it will also greatly enhance and facilitate the work conducted by the country's tax, administrative and customs authorities.

According to Artron and its Chairman Mr. Wan Jie, the only legitimate way to approach this colossal mission was to team up with a recognised and globally authoritative third-party certifier like Artprice, as World Leader in Art Market Information.

Never mentioned in the press or identified by economists or sociologists, this massive new market that Artprice is entering is typical of the kind of domestic market that only a central player in China's Art Market could have been aware of.

China's Provincial-level administrative divisions are the highest level administrative divisions in the People's Republic of China. There are 34 such divisions, classified as 23 provinces, 4 municipalities, 5 autonomous regions, and 2 Special Administrative Regions.

Artprice subscriptions sold exclusively by Artron in China will therefore reach directly into the heart of the need identified by Artron within China's domestic market. Similarly, Artprice will be accessible via Artron.Net's home page and all the Chinese social networks where Artron is omnipresent.

Artron's Chairman Mr. Wan Jie has already introduced Artprice to some very promising commercial contacts including the Chairman of China Guardian, China's first publicly-traded Chinese auction house. China Guardian needs high-end Artprice subscriptions for its VIP customers as well as Artprice's monthly analyses for its internal operations.

Thanks to Artron's unique technology in the field of scanning parchments, manuscripts and collection catalogues from the previous century, Artprice will finally be able to offer all its customers extremely high value-added data such as the hundreds of thousands of handwritten notes by Hippolyte Mireur and the various pre-17th century documentary collections that Artprice owns, which are too fragile to be scanned using Western scanning devices.

With this major breakthrough, Artprice will further strengthen its position as World Leader in Art Market Information.

In the context of this extraordinary alliance with Artron and the massive potential for new customers in China, Artprice is anticipating a major boost to its 2019 sales and profits.

For the launch and marketing of its services and databases in China, Artprice will benefit from all of Artron's logistical resources in terms of communication, via the Internet, as well as the physical world, thanks to its power, its reputation and its innumerable electronic and/or commercial networks throughout Greater Asia.

In this context, Artprice, with the assistance of Artron, has just translated 125 million data into the Chinese currency, the Renmimbi (RMB). Naturally the primary objective of this translation process is to facilitate the purchase of its data by its new Chinese clientele, presented by Artron. This captive clientele is accustomed to using Alipay and WeChat (1.8 billion users), two Chinese instant payment platforms (QR Code in kiosk mode debiting the Chinese customer on behalf of Artprice) that are mandatory for Chinese buyers.

Numerous synergies have already been identified from our joint working sessions and the merging of Artprice/Artron teams with the similar functions. Given the extent of strategic, financial and economic involvement with Artron, Artprice has decided to appoint a Chief Executive responsible for its Chinese and Greater Asia operations, who will reside in Beijing and work closely with Artron's teams.

The objective of this strategy is to accelerate the numerous initiatives recently engendered by Artprice's and Artron's contractual and promissory agreements. This informed decision has been carefully deliberated and enjoys unanimous support within the Group.

This appointment will, notably, make it easier to coordinate Artron's and Artprice's joint initiatives.

Artron's goals are both transparent and unambiguous:

In Mr. Wan Jie's own words: “The founders and Chairmen of the two companies, thierry Ehrmann and myself – with our enthusiasm for art – will create a Silk Road linking the Chinese and Western art markets on the principle of mutual respect and cooperation”.

“The two parties will build a global, diversified and professional exchange platform in the art market that will ultimately promote the sustainable development of the global art market.”

As this platform develops, Artprice's Standardised Marketplace® will host millions of works by Chinese artists, provided by Artron, generating a massive increase in the number of artworks available online.

Artmarket.com, .net and .org therefore represent a decisive advantage in our quest to capture and drive the Global Art Market's development on the Internet.

According to a bailiff's report established by the Estelle PONS - Sarah MERGUI licensed court bailiff partnership in Lyon, Artmarket.com is the top result out of 1.82 billion results on Google.com (all languages combined) and therefore represents the best possible vector for Artprice to promote the works of 1 million Chinese artists and their tens of millions of works (already hosted by Artron) in the Western art market.

In view of the radical change in scope anticipated, Artprice is naturally moving towards an IPO of its subsidiary artmarket.com, its Standardized Marketplace®, on a Chinese stock exchange (Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen ...) and not on an Anglo-Saxon exchange as originally planned.

According to thierry Ehrmann, “In 2019 Artprice will begin a new chapter alongside Artron that will trigger tremendous value for the global Art Market and our loyal shareholders. I am particularly pleased that my long-term strategy based on China's rapid economic emergence will generate such positive results.”

“Today I am 56; when I first visited China I was 25. Since then I have spent 30 years patiently studying the Middle Kingdom. Beyond this satisfaction, I have had the immense pleasure of knowing Mr. Wan Jie, a founding Chairman with whom I share the same vision regarding the democratization and promotion of art in the world. In short… Artprice's long march is about to reach its objectives for its shareholders and for the global art market.”

Artron will soon be publishing a documentary-report explaining all the meetings, discussions and agreements between the Artprice and Artron teams in Beijing. It will allow Western viewers to see images of Artron's ultra-sophisticated scientific processes and appreciate the economic power of Artron in Greater Asia.

According to the Artron Group and its founder-Chairman Mr. Wan Jie “After 7 years of cooperation, Artron and Artprice have optimised their cooperation regarding the Chinese and Western art markets. The founders and Chairmen of both companies, Mr. Wan Jie and Mr. Thierry Ehrmann, with their enthusiasm for art, will create a Silk Road linking the Chinese and Western art markets on the principle of respect and mutual cooperation.

"Khaleda to address 20-party rally in Gazipur Dec 27

Staff Reporter BNP chairperson Khaleda will go to Gazipur on December 27 to address a rally of her 20-party alliance in the district. The local unit of the 20-party will organize the rally at Bhawal Badre Alam Government College ground, BNP chairperson’s adviser Gazipur City Mayor MA Mannan told. Mannan said they have recently held a meting at BNP standing committee member Hannan Shah’s residence in Dhaka and finalized the rally schedule. The rally will be arranged protesting the ‘growing’ incidents of killing, enforced disappearance, abduction and the current ‘illegal’ government’s repressive acts and misrule, he said. The rally is also meant for drumming up public support in favour of their demand for snap polls under a non-party administration, he added. Mannan said they have already got permission from the college authorities to hold the public meeting. He said Khaleda will give direction to his party men about their upcoming decisive movement from the rally.

"TEHRAN (Press Shia Agency) – Israel protested to Jordan on Sunday after the spokeswoman for the government in Amman was photographed stepping on the Israeli flag during a meeting with trade unionists.

– World news –

Jumana Ghunaimat, Jordan’s minister for media affairs and communications and the government spokeswoman, on Thursday walked over an Israeli flag painted on the floor of the headquarters of Jordan’s professional unions in Amman, Reuters reported on Sunday.

She was on her way to attend a meeting between Jordanian Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz and union representatives. Razzaz, however, entered the building through a rear door, avoiding having to walk over the flag.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday deploring what it called the flag “desecration”, and said it had summoned acting Jordanian ambassador Mohammed Hmaid for a reprimand and that the Israeli embassy in Amman had also issued a “sharp protest”.

The flag was painted on the floor of the building several years ago to encourage passers by to tread on it, a mark of disrespect, unions said at the time.

Despite the neighbors’ 1994 peace deal and commercial and security ties, many Jordanians resent Israel and identify with the Palestinian struggle against it.

Jordan’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed al-Qatarneh confirmed in a statement issued via state media that the Israeli embassy in Amman had asked for clarifications over the incident and that Israel had called in the Jordanian charge d’affaires in Tel Aviv to “discuss” the matter.

Qatarneh said that Jordan respects its peace treaty with Israel and that Ghunaimat had entered a private building by its main entrance to attend an official meeting.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Networx: Black mold: Get it out of your house

Eew! Black mold! A mold-infested house not only looks and smells terrible; it may also be a serious threat to your family’s health. Find out how black mold can grow in your home and how to get rid of it.

What is black mold?

First of all, mold is a multi-celled, thready fungus. The more than 100,000 species of mold in existence come in a veritable rainbow of colors, including white, green, yellow, blue, and pink mold. ""Black mold"" can refer to a large variety of mold types, although it most commonly describes the highly toxigenic (toxin-producing) Stachybotrys — which actually tends to be blackish-green in hue. Many other types of black-colored mold are quite harmless.

Black mold in house health risks

If you’ve got black mold in your house, health risks include exacerbated breathing difficulties for household members with asthma or other respiratory problems, and an increased possibility of infection for immune-compromised people. Milder negative reactions include coughing, wheezing, and hay fever-like symptoms. Conditions such as extreme fatigue, impaired concentration, headaches, skin rashes, and digestive upsets have also been reported.

How does black mold grow?

Stachybotrys tends to grow in houses and other buildings which are damp due to any of several causes: leakage, poor sealing around openings such as windows and doors, inadequate ventilation, or flooding (post-Hurricane Katrina, many New Orleans homes were infested with black mold). Black mold thrives on a combination of moisture, warmth, and cellulose-based food sources like wood and drywall.

Mold testing

With black mold in the house, you may be tempted to call a commercial mold testing service or to purchase a DIY mold testing kit. However, the procedure for removal for any type of mold is the same, so you might prefer to spend your time and money actually getting rid of the fungus, rather than pinpointing exactly which variety you have. Nevertheless, mold testing could be useful in some cases — notably when you suspect there may be mold in your home (usually due to an acrid smell) but can’t spot any.

How do you get rid of black mold (or most other types of mold)?

Start by finding and removing the source of excessive moisture. Next, equip yourself with non-porous gloves, breathing mask, goggles, and protective clothing to protect against the mold.

Now it’s decision-making time. You’ll have to choose what may be cleaned (hard surfaces like walls and floors, as well as machine-washable textiles such as curtains and some area rugs) and what will have to be discarded (paper and cardboard, even treasured family albums — sigh! — in addition to badly molded fabric items, including upholstered furniture and wall-to-wall carpet).

Scrub hard surfaces thoroughly with soap and warm water. Launder washables with your usual detergent on a high setting, adding a commercial mold-removing agent if desired. Dry well, with the help of fans or outdoors in the sun where feasible. Unfortunately, some grayish stains may remain even after cleaning.

How to prevent mold

Worried about how to prevent mold? Good news: The prevention process involves just three simple steps. And it’s a lot easier (not to mention less emotionally wrenching) than dealing with the aftereffects of a major black mold infestation.

— Avoid any ""moisture traps."" For example, don’t leave wet towels or shower curtains crumpled up in the bathroom — spread them to dry. In a damp basement, avoid carpet and choose tile or concrete flooring instead.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"NORML Foundation Weekly News Release

Marijuana arrests more than doubled
since 1990 while, at the same time, the percentage of arrests for the
sale and manufacture of cocaine and heroin fell by over 50 percent, a
preliminary analysis of drug arrest statistics by The NORML Foundation
announced today.

""These figures affirm that law enforcement priorities have shifted
from targeting hard drug users and traffickers to arresting primarily
recreational marijuana smokers,"" NORML Foundation Executive Director
Allen St. Pierre said. ""As we enter the new millennium, the drug war is
now more than ever a war on marijuana smokers.""

The NORML Foundation examined FBI drug arrest figures between 1990
and 1997, the last year the agency has data available.

NORML found:

Drug arrests increased 31 percent since the beginning of the decade.
Rising marijuana possession arrests are chiefly responsible for this
overall rise in drug arrests.

Marijuana arrests rose every year since 1991, reaching an all time high
of 695,200 in 1997. Marijuana arrests increased 59 percent during this
period. Conversely, use of marijuana by adults remained unchanged.

The percentage of arrests for the sale or manufacture of cocaine and
heroin fell 51 percent between 1990 and 1997. The percentage of arrests
for all heroin and cocaine violations also fell by 34 percent.

There have been more than 3.7 million marijuana arrests this decade.
Eighty-three percent of these arrests were for possession only.

The arrest figures conflict with statements made by White House
Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey, who recently announced that America ""can not arrest
our way out of the [drug] problem.""

""The FBI data show that we are witnessing an unprecedented number
of drug arrests in the 1990s, the largest percentage of which are for
marijuana possession,"" St. Pierre said. ""McCaffrey and others need to
examine these figures and explain why they run contrary to the
administration's stated goals.""

St. Pierre also noted that marijuana use among adolescents has
increased despite the law enforcement crackdown. ""Clearly, the figures
show that targeting and arresting adult marijuana smokers does not deter
adolescent experimentation with the drug.""

St. Pierre labeled marijuana prohibition an expensive and wasteful
policy, and called for further analysis of whether the increased emphasis
on marijuana enforcement is causing police to neglect enforcement efforts
aimed at harder drugs like cocaine and heroin.

The NORML Foundation will soon issue a full report on its website:

Feds Ease Restrictions On United States' Only Legal Marijuana-Based Drug

July 8, 1999, Washington, D.C.:

Federal drug enforcement
officials
relaxed restrictions last week on the only legal marijuana-based drug.
The decision reclassifies synthetic THC, marketed as Marinol, as a
Schedule III controlled substance and is expected to expand patients'
access to the drug.

""Marinol is a legal alternative to marijuana that has demonstrated
safety and varied effectiveness among patients; for those patients who
find medical benefits from Marinol, this ruling is a positive step,""
NORML Executive Director R. Keith Stroup, Esq. said. ""However, to those
thousands of patients who find Marinol ineffective or less effective
when compared to whole smoked marijuana therapy, this reclassification
provides little relief.""

Stroup continued, ""Marinol is not necessarily an adequate
substitute
for whole smoked marijuana because it lacks several of the drug's
medically valuable compounds, known as cannabinoids. Therefore, this
decision is not a silver bullet for patients or politicians. Federal law
still must be changed to allow those unresponsive to synthetic THC the
opportunity to use inhaled marijuana as a legal medical therapy.""

The FDA first approved Marinol in 1986 to treat the nausea
associated
with cancer therapy. The agency later approved the drug as an appetite
stimulant for AIDS patients. Last week's reclassification ruling allows
doctors greater flexibility to prescribe Marinol and relaxes record
keeping requirements on the drug.

Stroup noted, however, that it raises further questions about the
future of medical marijuana. ""This decision by the federal government
acknowledges that one of the primary compounds in marijuana, THC, is
medically valuable and lacks a high potential for abuse,"" he said. ""Yet,
this same government maintains that marijuana must remain criminally
prohibited because it has no medical value and a high abuse potential.
This is the equivalent of the government endorsing Vitamin C but
prohibiting orange juice.""

For more information, please contact Allen St. Pierre or Paul
Armentano of The NORML Foundation @ (202) 483-8751. Copies of the NORML
Foundation white paper, ""The Need for Medical Marijuana Despite the
Availability of Synthetic THC,"" are available upon request.

A state task force convened by
Attorney General Bill Lockyer to explore ways to better implement
California's medical marijuana law will likely recommend patients
register for ID cards identifying themselves to police, The Los Angeles
Times reported.

Oregon already has similar regulations in place.

The task force, whose recommendations will be released shortly, is
also expected to recommend the state develop regulations allowing
marijuana clubs to operate openly.

Lawmakers are expected to introduce the task force's proposals
before
the state Legislature.

For more information, please contact California NORML Coordinator
Dale Gieringer, who served on the task force, @ (415) 563-5858.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Scene 1: The Douchbag Country Club. Very little activity ... no one golfing. A few employees scattered around. Jeff of the EIS is addressing six temporary EIS employees ... all have jackets with the EIS logo in huge letters ... all with official looking faux CSI kits. Jeff: ""OK, listen up people. This is a training exercise."" Jeff pauses to shoo away one of Conrad's flies which lands upon his shoulder and attaches. ""In a little while a small group of real reporters will be allowed on the premises. They're here to add realism to this exercise. You have mock cameras ... take pictures of anything that looks reasonable. No screwing around ... the whole exercise is being filmed."" A lie but who cares. ""Remember ... you do not speak to the media. If anyone asks you a question, say that all information on this case is classified and direct them to me, Agent Piccard. If any reporter gets pushy, call over one of the police ... they will warn the reporter not to bother you or they will be led off the premises."" One of the faux agents: ""Are there any phrases that sound really scienterrific that we could use with each other to sound impressive?"" ""The following phrase can be used if you ... say ... collect a soil sample ... or take a closeup photo of anything ... or even do a dust for fingerprints bit ... just say to your fellow agent, ""Do you think this is amenable to the fragistan carcoblans?"" ... and you both peer into each other's eyes like you said something meaningful. The reporter will be so busy trying to write down fragistan carcoblans and google it that that person will be out of action for ten minutes. It's fun to watch. One final thing. You have your list of red tape items. For example, all unopened alcoholic beverages and all materials from the kitchen walkin cooler will be red-tagged and moved into the red-tag van or the refrigerated red-tag truck. All other items will be loaded into the other vehicles for transport to the central office. That's it ... get to work ... try to enjoy yourself and always ... always ... look official."" The faux agents scatter ... some taking pictures ... other putting soil samples in test tubes and adding phony reagents. Two agents head for the storage areas to box up red-tag items for transport to Lenny's estate. Three reporters enter ... they've already been instructed to take all the pictures they wish but under no circumstances should they disturb the agents in any way ... treat this like a murder scene ... your cooperation is appreciated ... there will be a Q&A session with Head Agent Piccard at the end of the day.

Scene 2: Rory and Conrad at The Pot Shop, listening over the fly on Jeff's shoulder. Rory: ""This is great. Can you believe these clowns ... it's all bullshit. But why are they doing it?"" Conrad: ""My guess ... one ... the EIS needs a write up for appropriations time. This phony shit looks great on paper. Second ... we need to figure out what the red-tag items are all about. Third ... the EIS has lost a huge chunk of the funding it had in the last administration ... it can't afford science anymore. We're witnessing the devolution of our society. Pretty soon science will be stone knives, bear skins, and leeches. California might escape if it can break away from the rest of the continent but that's iffy ... they're human and most humans only react, not act."" ""Keep that fly on the EIS spokesman ... what's his name ... Agent Piccard ... keep that up. Let's see if we can get info if he makes a phone call.""

Scene 3: Golf Course. All the goods in the walkin cooler are being boxed, labeled with red tape, moved to the refrigerated van. Jeff is overseeing. Jeff calls Lenny: ""Lenny ... Jeff. I'm on site at the Golf Course ... we're boxing up the cold items for your house right now. They've got a huge collection of booze ... that's going to take some time to box up but I'm on it. Someone is also in the Pro Shop ... golf balls, tees, golf clubs ... I could use a few of those ... we'll take everything without a traceable logo. We can always pawn it on the side for pocket money. (pause) Yeah, don't worry ... this is going like all the other jobs ... I'll give the press the standard line of of nonsense so they have something to publish while saying absolutely nothing. I've already visited three of the local hospitals ... this whole black dick thing has me puzzled. Wish we still had the science guys to back us up ... damn cutbacks. By the way, do you think that there's any connection between the deaths in the Krupt family, the deaths of the protesters, and this outbreak? All these things happened in the same geographic area ... I smell something funny. (pause) Fine, I won't bother you. Is it OK if I take some time to visit my girlfriend Julie? Yeah, I'll button up here before I head out. I'll be at the Ingraham Motor Lodge in Lloyd if you need me. OK, out. Enjoy your loot.""

Scene 4: The Pot Shop. Rory and Conrad are staring at each other. Conrad; ""They're looting the place. The investigation is a huge scam! They're Making America Great Again!"" Rory: ""Yeah, but this Agent Piccard seems to have a brain ... he suspects that there's a connection to the Krupts. I want to meet this guy ... the Ingraham Motor Lodge ... I'll go visit.

Scene 5: Ingraham Motor Lodge parking lot. Rory is waiting in his car ... knows what Agent Piccard looks like ... waiting for the classic black government-mobile. There's a bar off the main motor lodge. And here comes the Fed. Agent Piccard exits his parked vehicle ... traveling case in hand ... enters the check-in. Rory exits his vehicle ... assumes that Jeff will be tired ... thirsty ... so he goes into the bar ... sits at a table ... orders a tonic water with a twist ... no alcohol. Fifteen minutes later Jeff enters ... goes straight to the bar ... sits ... orders a scotch on the rocks. Jeff downs his drink ... orders another. Rory waits 10 minutes ... lets Jeff's drink sink in ... walks up to the bar next to Jeff ... orders another tonic. Rory, to Jeff: ""You look beat ... tough day?"" ""God, don't ask ... I hate my job."" ""I hear that a lot ... that's why I have my own consulting firm. I choose my clients ... choose the problems to solve ... ignore everything else."" ""Ain't you lucky ... I work in hell ... the Federal Government."" ""What brings you to Anal-Noise?"" ""There's a potential public health problem ... a bunch of rich boys are turning up in hospitals with ... peculiar problems. I work for the EIS ... it used to be the FBI of science but with budget cuts we're more of a PR organization ... keep the public pacified while they think the government gives a fuck about them ... which it doesn't."" Rory: ""Hey, I haven't had dinner ... want to grab a bite ... I'm Rory."" ""Love to Rory ... I'm Jeff ... let's make it really expensive ... I've got a government credit card ... let's make the sucker public pay for it.

Scene 6: Expensive Restaurant. Rory sitting across from Jeff. Jeff continues to whine about his horrible life ... what he has to do to earn a paycheck. Jeff: ""I got a Masters in microbiology ... and for what? ... to work for some asshole. So what do you do in this consulting firm you own?"" ""I solve problems ... all sorts of problems ... in the field of food science, agriculture, product development, food processing, adhesives, ... you name it. I'll take on any problem as long as it's not pure physics."" ""I don't get it ... how can you be an expert in all those areas?"" ""I'm not. A new problem comes along and I'm the new kid on the block. My philosophy ... read everything ... listen to everyone ... BELIEVE NOTHING! Start from scratch. Let me give you an example. I was doing some work for a tomato processor in northern California and I heard of this problem they had with one of their processing lines ... intermittent temperature spikes ... been happening for 15 years ... causing all sorts of hell ... cost them a small fortune. I asked the Plant Manager if it was OK if I looked into it ... he thought I was crazy but he humored me ... told me not to hurt myself ... I was just a ""bean counter"". It took me and the head of maintenance less than 1 week to find the problem ... and the problem never recurred in the following three years. Done! I've got dozen of similar stories ... all the same. Ordinary scientists can't do shit ... they're there for the paycheck ... that's it."" ""Hell, tell me about it. (pause) Let me tell you my situation ... maybe you can help me. There's been the weirdest set of occurrences in this area ... have you heard of the death of Rep. Krupt and his family ... and the death of a whole bunch of protesters and their Pastor ... and now this golf course shit ... God, when it rains, it pours."" Rory's cell phone buzzes ... he sees it's Conrad. ""I've got to take this ... back in a minute."" Rory walks out of earshot. ""Yeeeees?"" ""I've been listening to your conversation with that agent ... this is a hoot. Question: Do we want to bug this idiot's office or do I recall my fly?"" ""Recall the fly ... have it land on me ... this guy's a whiny idiot ... totally useless."" ""OK ... will do ... when my fly lands on your shoulder, don't swat it."" ""Gotcha. Let me get back to the whiner."" ""So, what do you think ... could we hire you to solve this problem ... find if there is any connection between the deaths and weird shit?"" ""I avoid contact with the general public ... I would hate to be associated with anything which could put a person at risk. Like pure physics ... not my specialty."" A group of four gentlemen enter the room ... take a table next to Rory and Jeff. They're already drunk ... really loud ... don't care. ""God, I love this work ... giving shit to A-rabs ... pushing them around ... threatening to have them deported if they don't shut-up. What a great business to be in. When's the next meeting?"" ""Next week ... a combination KKK and White Nationalist shindig ... should be fun."" Jeff: ""I hate these white nationalist assholes ... think they own the country with their Emperor in the White House. I wish someone would do something about these obnoxious fuckheads."" Rory: ""Do you now .... (trails off ... Rory in thought).

"Property Tax Bombshell Exposed – Fleming

9th May 2013

Fianna Fáil Spokesperson on Public Expenditure and Reform Seán Fleming has said householders will be stunned to hear they face a hike in property tax after the local elections next year. This was confirmed to Deputy Fleming by the Revenue Commissioners at the Public Accounts Committee this morning.

Deputy Fleming said: “It was confirmed today that Local Authorities will be able to apply at 15% increase in the property tax at the end of next year, despite assurances that the property tax would not change for three years. This is a deeply cynical move by the two Government parties. As soon as Fine Gael and Labour get the local elections out of the way they intend to hit families again.

“The Revenue’s own information booklet on the property tax says “The market value of your property on the 1 May 2013 will form the basis of the calculation of the tax for 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.” The clear impression in the minds of the public is that the tax would not change for three years, but buried in the legislation that Fine Gael and Labour insisted on forcing through the Dáil with no debate, is a clause which would allow local authorities to inform Revenue, by September 2014, of their intention to apply an increase of up to 15% from January 2015.

“Fine Gael and Labour forced through this property tax legislation, blaming the Troika, and they encouraged the impression that people would not get hit with a higher tax next year. By holding back the increase until after the local elections, they obviously thought that the wool could be pulled over voters’ eyes.

“This is the wrong tax at the wrong time, placing unacceptable numbers of people across the country under unacceptable pressure. At the very least, the Government needs to repeal this underhand section of the legislation and insist that there will be no increases for at least three years.”

Hey Micheal Martin, whats this rubbish about you defending 180 Garda statements that didn't hold up in Court.. What strokes you trying to pulling in saving this broken institutions face.
A) Disband it, its too steeped in civil war politics.
B) Establish a new force with a separate investigative wing.

"Entries for 'freight rate risk management'

If your answer to the above question is anything less than ‘very,’ your company’s future may be at risk.

In the turbulent seas of the shipping industry, understanding the true market value of your fleet is the difference between sinking and swimming. Performing frequent mark-to-market (MTM) valuations is an integral part of doing business. However, due to the volatile nature of the industry, the complexity of calculating freight rates, and flaws inherent in popular valuation methods and tools, companies often end up with inaccurate numbers. This provides an erroneous picture of financial standing that can result in lost profits, faulty decision-making, and ultimately the demise of an entire business.

"Premier League Week 24 Fixtures: Full Picks and Predictions for Matchday 24

What does the Premier League have to follow up what were such lively midweek fixtures? More football, of course.

Matchday 23 featured quite a few surprising results, between Liverpool's 4-0 drubbing of Everton, West Ham's 0-0 draw against Chelsea in Stamford Bridge and Tottenham Hotspur's 5-1 home defeat at the hands of Manchester City.

Arsenal's 2-2 draw with Southampton meant that City leapfrogged them into first place.

Matchday 24 lacks the same volume of compelling matchups, but it has plenty of mouth-watering fixtures, with everything culminating with City's clash with Chelsea on Monday. It should be a thrilling weekend.

Newcastle vs. Sunderland

Scott Heppell/Associated Press

Crazy things always happen in the Tyne-Wear Derby. The fact that Sunderland have clawed their way out from the relegation places makes this match all the more exciting.

The Magpies will be without Loic Remy after he picked up a red card against Norwich City. At time of writing, it hasn't been overturned, but Newcastle may choose to appeal the suspension as it was a rather innocuous coming together with Bradley Johnson that led to the sending-off.

If Newcastle are without Remy, it's hard to see where the goals would come from. Don't forget that they'll also be without YohanCabaye, after he moved to Paris Saint-Germain:

Sunderland have had their own problems scoring, with Jozy Altidore failing to make any impact whatsoever since his arrival in the summer, and few others coming to the Black Cats' rescue.

This is normally a lively fixture, but the fireworks will be lacking in a match that has a dull draw written all over it.

Prediction: Newcastle 0, Sunderland 0

Everton vs. Aston Villa

Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images

For whatever reason, Aston Villa are a demonstrably better team away from home. At Villa Park, they have the 18th-worst record in the league. On the road, they're eighth.

Perhaps Paul Lambert feels a little more willing to play on the counterattack rather than try to dominate possession and control the game when his club is away from home.

Villa are a great counterattacking team, and they'll try to use that strength against Everton.

The Toffees won 2-0 when these two met earlier in the season, but with the match in Goodison Park, this could be a much more competitive fixture.

Villa demonstrated a lot of heart in their 4-3 win over West Brom. Couple that with Christian Benteke's strong run of form, and you've got a side capable of pulling off the road victory. The Belgian has scored three goals in each of his last three games after going 11 matches scoreless, per OptaJoe:

3 - Christian Benteke has now scored in three consecutive Premier League appearances after going 11 without one. Rampant.

Everton looked really shaky defensively against Liverpool, and they aren't on a great run of matches. That will continue on Saturday.

Prediction: Aston Villa 1, Everton 0

Manchester City vs. Chelsea

Matt Dunham/Associated Press

When these two clubs met, Chelsea won, 2-1. Fernando Torres scored in the 90th to give the Blues all three points.

There are two things different this time around.

The first is that Vincent Kompany has returned to the first team and brought some defensive solidarity to the City back line.

The second is that this game is being played at the Etihad Stadium. Manchester City have the best home record in the league, winning all 11 of their matches. They've scored an ungodly 42 goals at the Etihad, while holding opponents to eight.

Sergio Aguero could be a big miss for City, as he was injured in the win over Tottenham Hotspur.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Echoes From The Ashes by Christa Hedrick, a tale about reincarnation and the Holocaust

Meet Christa

The Author

Christa is retired and living in Rector, a small town in Northeast Arkansas. Although Rector is the town of her birth, she grew up on the Texas Gulf Coast and spent 15 years as a military wife, which afforded her the opportunity to live in many different places, including Germany. Living abroad was an experience she loved, crediting it with broadening her mind and awakening a sense of living in a world community.

A few years ago she and her friend, Lana Swearingen, co-authored a book about their lives as military wives and the two other women who met and became friends while their husbands were stationed at Ramstein AFB in Germany in the mid 70s. The four women, who still get together once a year, have remained friends as their lives have taken them on different journeys and to different parts of the country. ""We Were Army Wives"" is available on Amazon.com

She currently writes a column/blog for the Clay County Times Democrat keeping everyone abreast of the “goings on” around her small town. She has also creates and maintains websites including the Rector website: www.rectorarkansas.com

The Inspiration

At nineteen years of age, Christa was

living in Nuremberg, Germany as a young military wife. It was her first time to be out in the world as an adult and she hadn't known what to expect when she arrived. All she knew of Germany was from books and movies of WWII. She expected to meet anger and resentment. Instead, she found people to be friendly and welcoming, grateful for the help the Americans gave in rebuilding their country. Conversations with those who had lived and fought in the war taught her that these people were no different from the people back home. These weary, worn out soldiers had been young patriotic men during the war, much like her own father.

Years later when she was again living in Germany she visited the Dachau Memorial and knew she had to tell the stories of the people who had passed through the horror of the Holocaust.

The Book

""Echoes From The Ashes"" is fiction, but all the stories about the things that happened in the camps and to the citizens of Germany at the hands of the Nazis are rooted in actual events that happened many times over. It was a time of incredible cruelty against innocent people. She wanted to make them real for her readers to lift them up, those who survived the unimaginable and those who now soar free.

Events

Book Club

I am thrilled to announce that ""Echoes From The Ashes"" has been selected as the February book to read by the Like Minds Book Club in Rector. I will be making a presentation to the group at the February meeting on the 26th. I am looking forward to talking about the story and how I came to to write it. I am looking forward to them having a lot of questions.

"The IWC Pilot’s Watch Double Chronograph is a timepiece of extraordinary technical and stylistic achievement. Calling upon their own original and groundbreaking usage of zirconium oxide (ceramic) dating from 1986, IWC has introduced a new and limited production chronograph which showcases the exceptionally difficult split-seconds complication in a stealthy and exciting rendition.

The Pilot’s Watch Double Chronograph features a case manufactured from zirconium oxide, a material harder, more scratch resistant and many times more expensive than stainless steel. In addition to these attributes, this ceramic material is also completely non-reflective, as suits a watch which may have tactical applications. Subtle contrasts to the black ceramic are provided by the pushpieces and screw-in winding crown, which are made from titanium. The dial’s date wheel, which is shown in an unconventional three-day presentation, effectively evokes the altimeter gauge in an aircraft’s cockpit.

The automatic-winding 79230 movement which is hidden beneath the caseback of the IWC Pilot’s Watch Double Chronograph is a complex mechanism boasting 29 jewels and a 44-hour power reserve. It allows for the usual chronograph operation, as well as an intermediate time measurement which can be activated via the pushpiece at 10 o’clock. This type of chronograph, called a rattrapante, is the most technically demanding of chronograph mechanisms, as well as the most functional. Protected by a soft iron shield, IWC’s caliber 79230 can resist strong magnetic fields. As further testament to the serious nature of this chronograph’s design, the sapphire crystal is painstakingly secured to ensure that drastic changes in air pressure will not cause displacement. Strictly limited to 1000 pieces for the world, the subtle beauty of IWC’s Pilot’s Watch Double Chronograph will be the privilege of only a few connoisseurs and collectors.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"I read an article recently that said our concept of time speeds up as we get older because our daily routines aren’t interrupted by new experiences the same way they are when we’re children, when everything, every day brings something new. The key, the authors advised, was to do more things that create memories strong enough to jolt through the quotidian litany of our existence.

I am fortunate to have a job that in so many ways lends itself to this practice. But as I’ve settled into the flight attendant life, I’ve found myself sinking once again into the habit of thinking of time as something that is rushing by me - an endless series of venti vanilla lattes bought at 5 a.m., heels clicking under too-bright fluorescent lights in yet another airport, “welcome aboards” and “thanks for flying with us.” And while it’s all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking about life this way, it’s a narrative that ignores the many moments, both big and small, that have made my life richer.

To that end, I’ve taken some time to reflect on my favorite travel moments from 2018, the moments I pause at when I’m replaying the movie of this past year in my head. Taking some time to remember them has worked like magic, if you will, slowing down time and transforming it from a succession of takeoffs and touchdowns to a humbling reminder of how many things I got to see and do this past year that made my heart leap.

From a cold night in Brussels to the summer solstice in Spain, here are the moments in 2018 that made time stand still.

Foregoing French Fries for Pommes Frites in Belgium

I kicked off last year with a 48 hour layover in Brussels. It was absolutely freezing in that bone-chilling way Europe is after Christmas, which meant my sightseeing around Brussels and nearby medieval Bruges was punctuated every hour or so by a jaunt inside a cozy restaurant or bar to warm up. I ate until I couldn’t eat any more: Belgian waffles drizzled in Nutella, Flemish stew sopped up with warm homemade bread, delicate chocolates in the shape of swans, and mussels in big black pots. But my favorite meal, by far, was a thing of pommes frites and pommes sauce ordered on a street corner of the main platz. They were so hot that steam drifted off of them into the dark night and we devoured them with frozen fingers while we watched the lights dance off the gold that gilds the platz.

Making Layovers Great Again in Costa Rica

At my seniority, landing yourself a long layover at an all-inclusive resort is a bit like being Indiana Jones and finding the Lost Ark. But landing yourself a long layover at an all-inclusive resort and then finding out you’re going with three other flight attendants around your same seniority and age is like the real-life version of those Hallmark Christmas movies, where you find out the handsome man you’ve been dating is actually a prince and you’re going to be the new Princess of Moldovia. Maybe even better.

That’s what happened with my Liberia, Costa Rica layover, when a trip normally reserved for the most senior ended up having four baby flight attendants working it. We became fast friends and spent most of the day in the pool where we out drank even the Canadian fire fighters. We also fed some monkeys, dipped our toes in the ocean, and took a walk in our bikinis through the jungle. It was a perfect day filled with mojitos and laughter and, despite the fact that my liver wouldn’t make it, I wish all layovers were this fun!

Keeping Up with the Joneses in Gramercy Park

In April, I had the privilege of staying at the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York City, a hotel so sexy it barely turns any lights on and has its own Le Labo Candle to capture its signature smoke and sex scent. As a guest, I got to spend the night drinking cocktails in the shadowy Rose Bar, the glitzy lounge in the hotel lobby hidden behind thick red velvet curtains. I also received a golden key to the exclusive Gramercy Park. The park is one of two private parks in the city and its impeccably manicured acres are only accessible to those who live on it (the names of which read like some of history’s and Hollywood’s finest and include everyone from Julia Roberts and Karl Lagerfield to John Steinbeck and a handful of Astors). I felt like a character in a Wharton novel the morning I strolled through it, stopping among the splashy tulips to sit on a park bench and drink up the cold spring sunshine.

Arroz con Pollo in ViÑales

The couple that ran my casa particular in Viñales spoke no English and my Spanish is conversational, at best. But we spent all day together under the sun, clip clopping on horseback through the fertile red mud and tobacco fields that make this region a UNESCO protected area. And through broken Spanish and many repeated sentences, we learned a great deal about each other: that we shared a love of yucca, that he had granddaughters he adored, that being able to open an AirBnB had changed his family’s life, that we would both rather spend a day on horseback than anywhere else in the world. Afterwards, back at his farm, we took shots of Havana Club rum with his neighbor, both of them donning machetes and looking like an ad for la revolucion, as the sun sank behind cavernous limestone cliffs and his wife clambered about in the kitchen. And as I sat at the dining room table proudly displayed in his living room, eating one of the most delicious meals of my life, I thought about how this dinner wasn’t even a possibility ten years ago. Cuba and the U.S. have lived in fear of one another for so long, and now here we were, laughing until we had tears in our eyes. Our host cracked open another bottle of rum, spilling the first few drops on the ground as per tradition. “Por los santos!” he shouted. “For the saints.”

Sailing Mallorca

Sailing Mallorca with In Adventures Travel was my very first press trip. And man, was I nervous! So nervous, in fact, that I as I boarded my flight to Barcelona I confess I stopped in the jet bridge and thought about just spinning around and heading back home. I’m an introvert at heart, so spending four days on a sailboat with a dozen or so other people I’d never met before made me anxious. And they were all such talented writers and photographers - people who had probably done dozens of press trips! - that I worried they would take one look at me and my little travel blog and Instagram and wonder what on earth I had done to get myself invited on this trip. But saying yes to this press trip turned out to be one of the best things I’ve ever done and one of the things I’m most proud of in 2018. Because not only did I get to sail around the stunningly clear blue waters of Mallorca, but I met and became friends with a group of amazingly talented people who inspire me every damn day.

But stepping onto that plane turned out not to be the scariest thing about this trip! That honor is reserved for the day we rappelled down a cliff into the ocean, which is by far one of the most adventurous things I’ve done to date. I came so close to saying forget it and just walking down to the beach. But I knew if I didn’t do it that I would always wonder what it would have been like to say yes. So I suited up, took a big breath, reminded the man helping me with my harness that I would prefer not to die, and stepped over the edge. I think about that moment often, the moment that I didn’t let fear win, that I did the thing that terrified me. It’s the most powerful lesson I’ll take with me from 2018: when you have the choice to stick with what’s comfortable or do the thing that scares you, always always step over the edge.

Mornings on the Lanai in Honolulu

I tend to fall in love with every destination I visit, but there’s a handful of places, like Oahu, that make me feel like my soul is at home there; like the land and I were created from the same primordial stardust and are delighted at being together again. I spent a morning there on the famed Waikiki Beach, curled up on my lanai with coffee and a book while I watched the ocean change from a misty gray blue to a sparkling turquoise as the sun peeked over the lush mountains. And then, suddenly, there was a rainbow right in front of me, plunging its colors into the ocean. It was a simple moment but it was one of my absolute favorites and a perfect reminder that there’s magic and beauty all around us every day - you just have to look.

vino verde and pastel de nata in Lisbon

One of the hardest parts of my job is that you have no work community. With 24,000 flight attendants and 14,000 pilots, you fly with a new group of people every trip. Sometimes that can feel overwhelming, isolating, and exhausting (so much small talk!), and sometimes it’s amazing because you meet so many new friends that way. Case in point: Jules! We’d known each other less than five minutes when the rest of the crew kept asking us how long we’d known each other for and if we picked up this trip to fly together. And they must have been on to something because by the time we landed in Lisbon we were BFF. We spent the day exploring Lisbon’s pretty streets in inadvertently matching outfits, drank champagne on a sailboat excursion with the rest of the crew, wandered around pink street until the wee hours of the morning, and spent basically 24 hours straight talking about everything under the sun.

Swimming with Manta Rays in Kona

One of the things I am most afraid of in the world is the ocean, especially the ocean at night. Sometimes, I peer down at it on transoceanic flights and imagine being swallowed up by that cold blackness. Or, you know, being eaten alive by sharks and other creatures of the deep. So when I saw that swimming with manta rays at night was rated not only one of the best experiences in Kona, but in the world, my first thought was that there was no way in hell I’d be checking that one off my list. But I was still high off the adrenaline from pushing past my fears and rappelling down cliffs in Mallorca (see above!) so I went ahead and signed myself up. I had a moment of total panic right before I slid off the side of the boat into the pitch black water, imagining some sort of JAWS remake starring yours truly, but in the end I was neither abandoned at sea or eaten alive by sharks. Getting up close and personal with those graceful manta rays (one came so close it almost swallowed my GoPro) was truly the experience of a lifetime and I’m so glad I didn’t let my fears get in the way of checking it off my list!

prost to Oktoberfest

I might be biased because my family is of German descent, but I don’t think there’s anything better than a national holiday where everyone gets together to drink beer and eat pretzels while dressed in costumes that make you feel like a Bavarian princess. Except for maybe a work trip that pays you to drink beer, eat pretzels, and dress up like a Bavarian princess with your friend. And that’s exactly what happened when Jules (of the Lisbon story above) and I picked up a Munich during Oktoberfest! Working with friends makes even an international service go by in a flash and we had so much fun in our dirndls and braids, joining our entire crew to celebrate this festival of fall.

sunrise at the Taj Mahal

When I went on my first press trip, I secretly hoped I’d make some new friends that I might be able to travel with in the future. So when Laura and I rendezvoused in India a few months later, it felt like we had manifested not just a friendship but something bigger. And nowhere was that feeling more present than our sunrise at the Taj Mahal. We walked there in the blue black dark just before dawn, as bats the size of eagles soared overhead, and I still remember the audible gasp we both let out as we turned a corner and saw this monument to love for the first time. We slipped our shoes off and shared the quiet peacefulness of a mosque with some monkeys and only a handful of other travelers while we watched the tomb turn from pink to gold to a dazzling white with the sunrise. We leaned against each other and just took it in, overcome by the singular emotion of seeing a place that you’ve always wanted to see, of realizing that from this point on you’re forever a part of its story and its forever a part of yours.

Charleston with momma

Years ago, before travel blogging was even really a thing, my momma told me I should start one as a creative outlet. She’s believed in my writing since I scribbled my first story and she would laugh about how maybe it would land me a free hotel stay or two and we could use it to go on a few trips together. So when I was invited for a weekend stay at a posh hotel in Charleston, South Carolina, I immediately invited her along for a girl’s trip. Our schedules are both usually so busy that we rarely get the chance to travel together, so we had a blast exploring the quaint cobblestone streets, taking in some architecture tours, and eating too many platters of shrimp and grits. But the best moment, by far, was when the hotel surprised us by sending up some champagne and as we sat out on our balcony drinking our bubbly she looked over at me and said, “You really did it baby girl!”

Your Daily Leonard

As I've been chronicling, I am continuing to read the fine new Leonard Cohen bio and have finally reached just past the halfway point. He's survived his encounter with gun-toting Phil Spector, taken some time off, busted up with the mother of his two kids, and returned with a fine late-1970s that included two of his greatest songs: ""Hallelujah"" and ""If It Be Your Will."" Surprise: It was dropped by his record company and not even released at the time in the USA!

Figuring you've heard enough of ""Hallelujah"" for awhile (or for a lifetime), here is one of my favorite gems from that lp, which Leonard wrote about his wife, who now had a boyfriend. And below that, one of the greatest hymns--and please forhumanity--ever written, ""If It Be Your Will.""

When signing a contract for wholesaling, I assume you will have to have a deposit that will be held until closing. On average how much should this deposit be?
Also, I notice that there is a $97.00 per month charge for Deal-Insite. Is this charge for each web site created or would it cover both a buy... More web site and a for sale web site? Less

Does anyone have a technique or method to select workable properties from a Deal Dog list? I have noticed that many times there is large spread of the price listed on Deal Dog and the analysis sites.

"Elzbieta Szmytka & Levente Kende

Chopin’s name is indissociable from the virtuoso literature for piano which he composed. However, he also wrote melodies often inspired by the popular poetry of his compatriot Stefan Witwicki. In his melodies, Chopin opted for a simple musical language, interspersed with Polish dances. Szymanowski’s melodies are clearly rooted in 19th century tradition, but are also influenced by the exoticism and orientalism which were so characteristic of the European art scene at the turn of the century. His melodies based on Polish texts are little gems of refinement, interspersed with unexpected rhythmic and harmonic changes. The art of Polish melody will also be highlighted via the neo-romantic musical language of Mieczysław Karłowicz. Elżbieta Szmytka and Levente Kende – who have performed on stage at La Monnaie in the past – have more than deserved their international success.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"In Pictures: Top 10 Smoking-Gun E-Mails

Bill Detamore has seen plenty of smoking-gun e-mails as chief legal officer of IE Discovery, an Austin, Texas-based consulting firm that helps companies search through millions of electronic documents looking for evidence that could win--or torpedo--a case. Fortunately for prosecutors and hungry plaintiff lawyers, there are usually plenty. ""When you're writing e-mails, you're not thinking about how a jury will take it,"" says Detamore. ""Even sophisticated executives do it."" Here's Detamore's list of the top 10 smoking-gun e-mails:

Bear Stearns

""...the entire subprime market is toast."" This unwise, if frank, observation by former Bear Stearns executive Matthew Tannin came as he and his boss were assuring investors that the subprime funds they ran were still sound. Both were indicted for fraud June 19.

Microsoft

""Winning Internet browser share is a very, very important goal for us."" Bill Gates may have been stating the obvious in this 1996 directive to subordinates, but superlawyer David Boies used this and scores of other incriminating e-mails to convince a federal judge Microsoft had conspired to drive Netscape out of the business.

Chevron

American Home Products

""Do I have to look forward to spending my waning years writing checks to fat people with a silly lung problem?"" This e-mail from an American Home Products executive, discovered by plaintiff lawyers and leaked to the press, helped drive a $20 billion settlement of fen-phen claims.

Merck

""I just can't wait to be the one to present those results to senior management,"" said an angry Merck scientist, Dr. Alise Reicin, in a 1997 e-mail after cardiovascular symptoms emerged with Vioxx. Ultimate tab to settle the litigation: $5 billion and counting.

Arthur Andersen

""Remind the engagement team of our documentation and retention policy."" Arthur Andersen lawyer Nancy Temple's e-mailed instructions to the Enron auditing team preceded an orgy of document destruction and helped to seal Andersen's fate.

Credit Suisse First Boston

""Time to clean up those files."" In a similar vein, former Credit Suisse First Boston banker Frank Quattrone was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2004 for allegedly instructing employees to thwart a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation with this e-mail. The conviction was reversed on appeal.

Marsh & McClennan

""I will give you clear direction on who (we) are steering business to and ... who we are steering business from."" This 2002 e-mail from a top Marsh & McClennan executive helped former N.Y. Attorney General Eliot Spitzer make the case the insurance broker was engaged in a massive bid-rigging scheme.

Former Houston District Attorney

""The very next time I see you, I want to kiss you behind your right ear."" One of the few printable e-mails from former Houston District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal, who resigned this year after this e-mail to his secretary and hundreds of others emerged in an unrelated civil rights suit.

Former Detroit Mayor

""Never busted. Busted is what you see! LOL."" Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was confident his affair with a city official was secret when he sent this text message. He was later indicted for denying the affair under oath.

3:38 AM MST | January 28, 2013 | Natasha Alperowicz

Saudi Arabian Mining Company’s (Ma’aden) subsidiary Ma’aden Phosphate Co. (MPC; Riyadh) will shut down its di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) plant at Ras Al Khair, Saudi Arabia for maintenance. The company says that it decided on the shutdown because of lower seasonal demand for DAP. Maintenance work commenced today and will last approximately three weeks.

"The Great Water Debate

Environment Minister David Parker announced plans to limit nutrient loss from farmlands to waterways during yesterday's edition of Q + A.

Speaking with host Corin Dann, Parker discussed halting further environmental degradation and making notable improvements to the overall state of the environment over the next five years, and then, in the succeeding generation, getting things ""back to where they need to be"".

To achieve this Parker says nutrient limits will be implemented, which in some cases will force farmers to destock. This, he says, is in reaction to the fact that ""In some areas, the number of cows per hectare is higher than the environment can sustain"".

Despite these stock-limiting measures being likely to severely impact the wallets of some farmers, Parker says there will be no compensation:

""You don't compensate people for stopping pollution. Just because you could pollute last year doesn't mean you should now be paid to stop doing it.""

Parker says long-term solutions are the key; for example, moving towards more cropping and horticulture in South Canterbury, where these land uses are of higher value.

Rather than subsidising this land use change, Parker says the government will enable it through the new technologies that they are willing to subsidise going forward, such as sensors, positioning systems and robotics.

Parker says economics will drive change where there is a high value land use, and where economics wont, regulation will.

This regulation will come in the form of new national policy statement which will forbid increases in land use intensity, and bring forward a methodology for the allocation of nutrients in nutrient-enriched catchments.

These announcements come shortly after discussions over putting farmers into the emissions trading scheme, and, along with cuts to funding for irrigation schemes, and plans to stop oil and gas exploration, show the new Labour government's willingness to severely crack down on industries doing harm to the environment.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"I haven’t really thought about expanding in quite a while – the twin specific blogs have gone fallow a long while ago.

A blog on nothing more than photographs would be on top of the list, but even with the visually impressive monotone (that adapts to the dominant color of the photograph) I haven’t taken the plunge yet.

The idea of doing book or movie reviews on a separate blog does sound a bit attractive, but would also be a bit too much work and redundant.

I haven’t been actually challenged, but that’s not a reason NOT to participate in a meme.

The instructions are simple:

Enter the fourth directory in your picture stash.

Choose the fourth picture in your blog

Describe when/why/how you took it.

Challenge four people to participate

Well, this picture is from New York, close to the WTC ground zero, taken in January 2002, after the cleaning crew was mostly done with the rubble. This was a cold day, easily fifteen below zero, the chill compounded by stiff winds off the rivers.

The camera was a brand new Canon G3, and this image is the nineteenth picture taken with it.

I fell for Richard Kelly’s Donnie Darko on a first view, and haven’t been able to shake the feeling. Even though his later career has not been exactly successful, especially in the box office, I still have faith. I hated domino, but liked Southland Tales pretty much more than anybody else.

The arrival of S. Darko was a complete surprise – while it’s not a direct sequel to Kelly’s debut nor actually directed (or even written) by him, it’s still among the “films to check out in 2009″.

Guillotine, published in 1998 by Wizards of the Coast, is a deceptively simple card game that is easily taught and enjoyed by pretty much anybody who can distinguish between gallows humor and actual celebration of nobility getting decapitated.

Indeed, the subject of the game is on the grim side. It depicts a struggle between rival executioners in the last days of the French revolution. A struggle in which success is measured by the lopping off and collecting of as many nobles’ heads as possible.

The game is easily learned, but the random nature of its course (especially when more than two players are involved) turns it into a chaotic affair where luck and skill alternate.

The bloody nature of the topic is gracefully sidestepped with use of plain and humorous art. The images on the cards are provided by two veteran Wizards artists: Quinton Hoover and Mike Raabe, both with a long career of MtG-illustration as a merit.

Even though the publisher is famous for flogging good games t death with expansions, Guillotine curiously never got anything additional designed for it. An omission that is tackled with the addition of new cards in boardgamegeek.

The simple nature of the game lends itself to online play as well. A version was produced for the aborted Gleemax portal. It is now available on the gametableonline.com, and much more attractively on facebook as well. Haven’t tried either, but will do, soon.

Yesterday was the chinese new year, when the year of the rat turned into the year of the ox.

Helsinki celebrated the occasion for the third time, with a smallish festival on Lasipalatsinaukio in the middle of downtown.

The weather was far from optimal. The consistent drizzle threatened to turn the bright red rice paper lanterns into mush, and definitely made the icy ground underfoot uncomfortably slippery.

The square was packed with people. Especially the food court was stuffed and unruly enough to deter from queuing up. By far the most scrumptious offerings were by Dong Bei Hu – their barbecued squid on a stick is definitely something to try out on an inevitable visit.

Had dinner in Tang Village in Kamppi instead. Clearly a popular alternative, since the staff was persuading everybody to stick to the buffet instead of ordering something off the menu. Which was a good choice, since the buffet was indeed filled with good dishes – with selection alternating somewhat between rounds (at least the grilled tofu was curiously absent before going for seconds).

The evening was capped by a sponsored fireworks display over Töölönlahti. The fifteen minutes of pyrotechnics was occasionally impressive, and the vantage point on the side balcony of the parliament building provided an excellent view to all rockets but the ones shot low. The camera of the n96 proved to be spectacularly useless in the tough conditions.

The list is wide indeed, covering both the biggest hits (Enter Sandman, One) and some great misses (Frantic). Too bad Four Horsemen is entirely absent, but the likes of Orion and Whiplash round out the selection nicely. Death Magnetic is represented by a single song only, but the entire album is available as downloadable content.

As with the game centered on Aerosmith, other bands get their day in the sun as well – here the selection ranges from songs covered by Metallica (Lynyrd Skynyrd’s Tuesday’s Gone and as a definitive highlight Diamond Head’s Am I Evil?) and liked by the band (System of a Down, Corrosion of Conformity and Motörhead are all featured).

Despite the name, this is a full-band game, and hopefully the Neversoft/Harmonix-promise of instruments being cross-usable between the Guitar Hero- and Rock Band-franchises remains watertight.

Thus far I’ve avoided going beyond a single guitar (two, actually, but the PS2 and Xbox 360 instruments are not destined to meet), mainly due to space and availability reasons. The strong set list and my 20+ years as a Metallica fanboy do mean that this game will sooner or later find its way to the HQ.

As the third (and way long overdue) mystery novel read over the christmas break, here’s the lowdown on the newest Maria Kallio-novel by Leena Lehtolainen: Väärän Jäljillä.

It’s been three years since the previous novel, Rivo Satakieli, and the break’s been beneficial. Väärän jäljillä is a back to basics book, enjoyable in the encompassing familiarity, yet bringing in enough new spices not to be a rehash from the previous. The authors mannerisms are present, but way more subdued than in the previous novels.

The subject is the murky world of sports, and the advance of commercialism. There are a lot of more than thinly veiled analogies to real-world figures, and all in all the plot has elements that wouldn’t be out of place inthe real world.

Oddly enough, the franchise has now been decorated with a dedicated website of its own.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"David
So casual. So nonchalant. You’d think we were only acquaintances, that we’d once sipped a couple of beers together instead of tattooing love on our skin and reciting marriage vows. I read the e-mail again and analyze the shit out of it. How can I not? I count out the words: thirteen. The punctuation: four. His name, my name. A flippant, casual turn of phrase: catch up. In the end, there’s only so much psychoanalyzing you can do to a thirteen-word e-mail. I move on with my life, feeling rather pathetic. But not before I e-mail him back. And okay, sure, I don’t move on with my life. What does that even entail? Forgetting? Forgiving? Being happy? Besides, I know what he wants to talk about. I know why he’s coming.
Hi David,
Yeah, sounds good. Let me know when and where.
Yara
My e-mail is a word shorter.
I’m that petty.

Tarryn was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa. She immigrated to America with her parents when she was thirteen, and spent the next eighteen years in South Florida where she earned her degree in Psychology, wrote her first novel, and had two children. In 2012, on a whim, she moved her family to Seattle, Washington where she currently makes her home safely away from the sun. Tarryn is the founder of Guise of the Villain, a fashion blog, and has written eleven published novels.

MY REVIEW

Conflicted about this one

Every time I don't love a Tarryn Fisher book I feel guilty, I must say. At first I thought of not leaving a review, but this is what I do for a hobby, I blog, and therefore I can't not be honest about it. I'm a PLN and that's why I feel guilty. I love Tarryn and her books, she's one of my favorite authors ever and will always continue to read her books with the same enthusiasm. I'll always get excited when we're announced a new TF is coming out, I'm sure of that.

Now to the point: I liked this book as the personal journey of inner growth that Tarryn did herself, I actually love it in that sense. But I didn't love it as literature itself. I believe I like Tarryn's writing more when she's writing darker stories. Mud Vein and Marrow are still on the top for me. I love the writing style of those ones. Mud Vein is, for me, the better written, most poetical book of hers. And Marrow has a pace so accurately written I could cry. Just perfect. I can't say the same about AWNAP. It came out as a bit informal and not during the times that it needed to be informal given the characters points of view, but during the rest of the narration and I usually enjoy a poetical language a bit more. There were, either how, some passages and phrases that I completely love! I secondly couldn't connect with so many inner monologues going on. I believe more in show rather than tell and I know that she does as well, so this confused me as well.

Regarding the characters, I have to say that I had a hard time connecting with them, I believe I did it almost at the end, but it was too late for me to fall head over heels for them. It's not that I didn't like their flaws (they were really flawed characters and I was totally okay with that, we're humans, right? Keep it real), but I just couldn't personally connect enough to fall in love with them. I did felt sad about them many times, but as they wrote their paths, not so much. However, I did love and fangirled about the ending and the previous parts that lead to that. I think that part three was my favourite from the book. I believe Yara getting a grip of her life was a breath of fresh air. Let's say I was kind of mad at her during the other parts of the book because, just as her friend said to her, I always believed she was putting excuses not to take responsibility for her existence and grew the ovaries to go after what she wanted. So I did enjoy her development. I liked David sometimes, didn't agree with him some others. I disliked Petra at first, until I started disliking David instead. I maybe liked Ferdinand more than the others even when we didn't get to know a lot about him.

Regarding the plot I do remember we were told it was going to be TO styled, and I liked it even though I couldn't quite connect with the characters for a long part of the book. Either how the third part of it made the book worthy for me.

Finally, though I'm on the minority with this book, I have to say that I do know why everyone loves this, many people needed a story like this as a wake up call and I'm glad they're feeling healed by it. The amazing thing about Tarryn is what she causes with her writing and though she didn't do it for me this time she did it for lots. So I did like the background of the story and the message it left.

I'll leave you here with my favourite quotes now:

° I'm in love with cities, all of them. Each one had their own thing going on, a unique spice they add to the world, but they all had one thing in common: energy.

° Beauty was deceiving in the same way credit cards were.

° Relentless. There's something about a relentless man. You couldn't ignore them. If they asked long enough, eventually they wore you down. Women looked for that, persistent interest. An investor. We were, in ourselves, an entire universe.

° That was the thing about artists, they didn't often think of you. Their energy had a narrow focus, a spotlight on their art... their insecurities... the unfairness of the world.

° How often do we lie to ourselves and say we don't care about something when we do?

° There's no moving on when you're truly in love. You try and you keep trying, but that love is a stain in your life. It's just not that easy.

° It's the simple things that tell the most about our complexities.

° Someone should take you as you are, not have and agenda for how they want to change you.

° David was hesitant to talk about himself, he preferred to listen. To me, that was the mark of a true artist -someone who gathered instead of took.

° Men had a thing for female vulnerability. They wanted to be their hero.

° You can't just threaten kids with their futures when they don't understand the gravity of time.

° The spectrums of pain were meant to be felt and they were beautiful in their own way because they caused change.

° When you set out to find someone, you don't stop until you do. And then you have to deal with what you find.

° Love was a leap of faith, and love was just a word until someone gave it definition.

° It's not true what they say, that you can only give your heart away once. That's the philosophy of the young. The old know better, they know it's not your heart that you give away, but the mind. The mind is a powerful thing. It controls the heart but most people don't know that.

° It's okay to be you Yara, she says. The people who love you will work with your shortcomings, not against them.

° - Tell me, David Lisey, what's the meaning of love?- It's when you can't get someone out. They crawl inside you and they just live there for the rest of your life.

° When you're unhealthy, healthy things are frightening.

° You don't forgive because they deserve it. Most of the time they don't. You forgive to keep your heart soft. To move forward without bitterness. Forgiveness is for you.

° Even to your old age and grey hairs I am he, I am he who will sustain you. I have loved you and I will carry you; I will sustain you and I will rescue you.

I would definitely recommend this book to someone who's in need of a soul lifting story about love. If you're in a place were you're afraid of love, or holding old resentments, then this is for you.

As I've said before, I can't wait for Tarryn's next work no matter what, her words are my spirit animal.

Lately I've been reading more and more that writers, actors, singers, and any celebrity shouldn't have an opinion over anything that's not what they do for a living and if they do they're being harassed over social media and told that they should shut their mouths and mind their own business (write/act/sing/etc). This, beyond being rude, seems terribly ridiculous to me. Why's that? Well, as a start, we're all citizens with rights and that some of those citizens are famous for their jobs doesn't end their right to freely express their opinions and act towards their ideals or beliefs. We all have that right, it's called freedom of expression and it's been a while since it was entitled to everyone and not just a few. We don't get to decide who can speak and what they can speak about. If what they're saying, for whatever reason, makes you uncomfortable, just skip it, maybe read something else in that moment and come back to them whenever they say something that may interest you. You don't have to agree a hundred percent with someone to like them, you wouldn't have a family or friends if not, but you also can't shut them. It's disrespectful. Imagine that someone comes and says 'Hey, you're housewife/chef/teacher/seller, just do your job and don't talk about anything else because I say so'. Well, people would start to have very little conversation with their neighbours, coworkers and even friends. Groups would be formed depending on what you work and you would ONLY talk about that. Imagine, if you already don't like to go to work EVERYDAY, how it'd be to have to JUST have to speak about it 24/7 for the rest of your life. It doesn't sound very enticing, huh?

So be it, we're all people with the same rights and bla bla bla, I think you got me, but let's go beyond that. Let's ask ourselves, if those who have a voice that can be heard over the noise don't speak up, if those who can help the ones whose voices aren't being heard don't do it, if those who are in the place to shake things up don't shake them, then who? Then why? Why have a voice if you won't use it? Why have the power to give it to someone else? Why can you help but you don't? Everyone is entitled to choose their battles and if you don't like the battles they choose, just let them anyhow. If you're so sure that what they're saying is wrong then you should also be sure that they will go unheard. But if you, only for a second, tremble upon it and think they must be silenced, then maybe there's something in you that may be fearing they're right about whatever they're deciding to speak about...

Anything you can do

It’s been a decade since I’ve seen him, but our years on opposite coasts were less of a lasting peace and more of a temporary cease-fire. Now that we’re both back in our small town, I know Lucas expects the same old war, but I’ve changed since high school—and from the looks of it, so has he.

The arrogant boy who was my teenage rival is now a chiseled doctor armed with intimidating good looks. He is Lucas Thatcher 2.0, the new and improved version I’ll be competing with in the workplace instead of the schoolyard.

I’m not worried; I’m a doctor now too, board-certified and sexy in a white coat. It almost feels like winning will be too easy—until Lucas unveils a tactic neither of us has ever used before: sexual warfare.

The day he pushes me up against the wall and presses his lips to mine, I can’t help but wonder if he’s filling me with passion or poison. Every fleeting touch is perfect torture. With every stolen kiss, my walls crumble a little more. After all this time, Lucas knows exactly how to strip me of my defenses, but I’m in no hurry to surrender.

Knowing thy enemy has never felt so good.

I am a lover of books, chocolate, reality TV, black labs, and cold weather. Seriously, if I had it my way I would be curled up on the couch with all of those things… everyday.

I live in Texas where I spend my free time writing and reading. My favorite authors are Mindy Kaling & Jonathan Safran Foer. I’m a comedy geek and love all things “funny”. Women like Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Mindy Kaling are definitely the biggest inspirations for my writing, though I think my work tends to skew a bit smuttier than theirs.

REVIEW

R.S Grey's words were, once again, addictive

I'm a sucker for Grey's stories, they instantly draw me in and this was no different. It was fun, well written and the pace of the story is fast. I read this in a day and didn't want to put it down.

""Friction implies contact. What we have is magnetic repulsion.""

Daisy, though she may seem childish, is a sassy, a bit crazy, and hilarious woman. She reminds me of R.S. Grey's previous heroine, Georgie, who is my favourite from hers. I did enjoy her thinking and she got me laughing plenty times.

This book speaks about subjects that matter, it's a story about self acceptance and self love. It is about overcoming your past and taking the leap for your future.Jessica is a young woman who is diagnosed as obese and with diabetic conditions. With ghosts from her past hunting her, she always seeked comfort in food. When she finally decides to start making choices to improve her life, and she moves to Santa Barbara, she meets Mikey, a hot veterinarian who sees her, really sees her, and won't stop until he gets the answer he wants from her. But Mikey also has a past to hide. Will they be able to heal?The premise of the story was hooking, the characters were interesting, but unfortunately, and I feel really bad about it, I couldn't quite connect with it as pretty much everyone else did. I particulary am more fond of action than inner monologue and I think that's what maybe didn't do it for me. I like being showed what happens more than I like being told, I connect more that way.Anyhow I still love Leslie's stories and I was really happy to see her other couples make an appearance in this book! It was fun to read.I will continue to read her stories and follow her advice to take the leap!*I voluntarily reviewed an Advance's Readers Copy of this book*

This book is the third and final (?) installment of the Hidden Scars series and CAN'T BE READ AS AN STANDALONE unless you want to spoil yourself the plot of the previous books as happened to me.

I'm having trouble to write this review because I thought I'd love this story but I didn't. The premise was good but the development didn't live up to it, at least not for me.

BLURB

Fate.

I’ve been running from it most of my life – doing everything I can to avoid the future it had dictated for me. If I had learned one thing from the hell I went through as a child, it was that I never wanted to go back. Until I ran into someone who was running from her destiny just as hard as I was.

And it just so happens that she’s one of my best friends.

One night, emboldened by alcohol, she does something that has me questioning everything and it doesn’t take me long to realize that maybe instead of running away from something, I’ve been racing to her all along. But there is fear in her eyes and I know that her fate won’t be so easily shaken.

Will I ever be able to work past her fear to show her everything we could be? Or am I destined for the same kind of desolate life I’ve been fleeing from since I was a kid?

I enjoyed the first 40% or so of the story, I like the building of the romance between Addy and Trey though I really couldn't stand the heroine. There was way too much inner dialogue from her telling that she was sad because she wanted something really hard that she could never have. The first three times was okay, but when it kept being mentioned through the whole story it got to be annoying. You can mention it once or twice at most, the reader will understand. I really found myself reading some paragraphs as fast as I could to *kind of* skip those repetitive statements.

Regarding the characters, Addy is really hard to empathise with, she's always complaining about her 'fate' without actually learning if her fears are sustained or not, and she pushes everyone she loves away for an illogical reason. Trey himself was much more enjoyable the first half of the book, but then started acting as an ass*ole, and even when it was understandable that he didn't know what to do with Addy because she wouldn't open to him, I didn't like at all that he kept justifying his behaviour by saying ""You make me crazy, Addy"". I mean, it sounds pretty messed up that you can't control yourself and blame the woman for 'making you crazy'. I'm sure he meant it in a 'romantic' way, but it ended up being disturbing.The secondary characters were more lovable than the heroes, for sure. Addy's friends were funny and loyal. And Trey's family is the sweetest and they're really supportive. I also fell in love with Addy's parents' story, I'd enjoy reading something from them.

In conclusion, this story was sweet for some moments, but the protagonists wasted so much time that we barely got to see their bright side together. I did enjoyed the beginning and the ending, but I rushed through the middle, not fancing it so much.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

First Glimpse, the Other Side

Hannarah grasped the cup in her hand, the warmth of the tea spreading slowly up her arm. This was a comfortable tent, as far as those go, well lit and spacious. There were even enough blankets and pillows that one could forget that there was no bed, no mattress, no civilization out beyond these fabric walls. Hannarah closed her eyes, letting her awareness drift over the feel of the chair under her, against her back, to the cup cradled between her hands. She slowly lifted the warm ceramic cup to her lips, though did not drink, not yet. The breath she exhaled mingled with the steam rising from the liquid surface and flowed back over her face. Inhaling, the mint and ginger aromas tickled her nostrils. She felt a tingling wave of comfort spread down her neck and back. She pressed her lips gently to the rim of the cup, feeling its warmth, and then sipped the tea into her mouth, slurping a little, so as to spray the tea all over her tongue, so she could feel the flavors make sense of themselves. Her focus, her mindfulness, was a difficult thing to maintain, as there were unfamiliar sounds beyond the tent walls, beckoning her to lose her grasp on the moment, to let fear overtake her. The way the citrusy, peppery flavor of the ginger mingled with the cool, sweet flavor of the mint inspired her to take a deep breath. She felt the minty vapors mingle with the humid jungle air, and opened her eyes. She looked around the tent again, trying to remind herself that she was just as safe here, in undiscovered country, among savage aborigines, with the small contingent of soldiers she was here to take care of to protect her, as she would have been in her own bed back at the Capital Temple.

“Maiden, Mother, Crone,” she whispered, taking special note of the feel of the ground beneath her feet, “please, help me to be a pillar of strength for these men, and a good companion, and an able healer, should the time come that such skills are needed. Help me to remember that no matter where I go, you are already there, and you are not only the Allmother, but my Mother. Remind me of your love and your protective spirit. Maiden, Mother, Crone, so mote it be.”

She sighed, the prayer giving her some strength. She stood from her chair, and took her linens from the hook, wrapping them about herself in the prescribed way, covering her and revealing her at the same time, the tension of the long strip of fabric enough to keep it tight against her skin, wrapped and rewrapped to form the semblance of a halter, a corset, even a flowing loin skirt for the ends. The wrap was the traditional garb of her creed, and her body fit it well. She then wrapped the sandals to her feet, the leather straps tying up her shin. Finally, she took the robe from it’s hook, and slipped into it easily. She glanced in the polished silver mirror they hung from one of the tent poles, and applied what little makeup she had brought with her on this long journey. She wasn’t meant to be a regal and royal temple consort on this mission, but the consort to soldiers and sailors, and they were grateful enough for a listening ear, a capable healer, and the occasional shared bed. She was pleased enough with her appearance, and turned to leave the temple of her tent. Suddenly, the lieutenant stepped into the tent, his face sweaty, dirty, and tight with tension. Not fear, exactly, but the focus of a soldier.

“Mother Hannarah, please, stay inside. Some of the men haven’t gotten back from their patrols, and we need to make sure everything is okay before you come out. Len will be right outside to guard you.”

And with that, the officer was gone again. Now that Hannarah had a jolt of panic in her system, her senses were on fire, and she could hear the men outside mobilizing, anxiety in their voices and movements. As they prepared, she heard them speaking quietly to each other. Something in the woods seemed to be spooking them. She felt a bit nervous herself, and she went back to sit, facing the entrance to her tent.

It seemed like a few of them began to make their way away from base camp, and in moments, Hannarah heard sounds of fighting. Angry shouts, gunshots, the clanging of metal on metal, the grunts and screams of men dying. They were not a large group, their resources would not hold out for long. If the threat was not stopped soon, then their would be no one left but her. The numbers of participants in the combat outside began to dwindle, and soon it sounded like their was only one man left, the lieutenant himself, fighting whatever it was outside. It didn’t sound like there was a mob out there, either, so whoever, whatever, it was killing her men was very dangerous. Hannarah wasn’t sure to be scared of the ferociousness of a small force, or eased that they weren’t being overrun. As the last stretch of hand-to-hand combat outside ensued, the sounds of imminent danger reminded her of another time in her life.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

I have a habit of doing things spur of the moment. Like this afternoon, for instance. I decided I wanted to go experience an olive oil and balsamic tasting first hand…so I did. Immediately upon thinking of it. This is how I roll.

A few months ago, a new tasting shop opened in St. Catharines called Della Terra Tasting Bar. As soon as I saw that it was opening my taste buds started yelling at me to treat them. There was never enough time in the day when I did think of it until today. So as soon as it crossed my mind I grabbed my purse and jumped in my car. It was quickly decided that my daughter and her friend would come along for the new experience. I would have just as happily gone solo had they not been interested.

Olive Oils & Balsamic

We were lucky that the tasting bar was having a quiet moment and had the full service of a knowledgeable guide. She walked me through the types of olive oils and handed me samples as we talked, explaining the differences. She was a wonderful wealth of information. I never thought of sipping olive oils as something I would enjoy so thoroughly. There is such a huge leap from regular store-bought olive oil that is often blended or of inferior quality to imported, cold pressed pure olive oils from different countries. I had come into this knowledge a few years ago while in California and had sampled high quality oils and balsamics and have been searching for comparable quality in this area ever since. Today, I struck pure gold! Or should I say green?

The rich, smooth texture of the oils was sublime. Each oil was vastly unique. I sampled mild, medium and robust olive oils and ended up purchasing a medium oil called Picual. Oh my. The robust oils hit my throat like I had just ingested liquid pepper. So not expected (even though she warned me)! It was fantastic. It was fun watching my daughter and her friend taste the oil. My daughter stuck her tongue in the sample cup then declared it wasn’t for her. They couldn’t get over the fact that I was sipping cup after cup of the stuff and watched with wide eyes. They quickly zipped over to the balsamics when given their leave.

After the straight up olive oils I moved on to the flavored olive oils. So many to choose from…sinfully delicious varieties. Swoon. I decided on a blood orange infused olive oil that is out of this world. It is so divine I don’t want it to even touch other flavors but go straight to my palate unadulterated. But that would be greedy not to allow the flavor sensation to meld with other foods, wouldn’t it? It’s experiment time!

Next, I sidled up to the balsamic tasting bar and got busy. My first sample knocked my socks off (well, if I was wearing socks it would have) – coconut white balsamic. After having the smoothness of olive oil sliding down my throat the sharpness of vinegar took me back slightly but the coconut flavor was strong and true. It would be a great summer fruit salad accompaniment. I only had eyes for the dark balsamics though. Sinful and luxurious they beckoned me to them. I had the intention of finding figs to have with a great aged balsamic this weekend but instead found a fig balsamic that took me by aback. It came home with me. No surprise there.

I believe that we all need to indulge ourselves with experiences and things that make us feel alive. Today this is what I desired,so I treated myself.

“The lesson adults can learn here is that the world is filled with things for our enjoyment.” – Allen Klein

"The Mysterious Secret Society of Assassins

Secret societies are mysterious enough, but sometimes they go beyond merely enigmatic, spooky organizations and gather a dark reputation as being a lethal force to be reckoned with, reaching out to deal death to those who oppose them. Such is the story of a shadowy secret order of assassins which was formed in ancient Persia and which kept the region under the grip of terror for over a century. Always lurking in the shadows, they could be anyone, and they were always ready to pounce, patiently waiting for word from their master to bloom outwards from the darkness and shadows to deliver death at a moment’s notice. Let us delve into some of the murky history of one of the most secretive and lethal secret orders of the ancient world and indeed history as a whole.

The road to the formation of one of the most terrifying secret societies the world would ever know began in Egypt in the first millennium AD, which was then under the control of the Ismaili sect of Shiite Islam, which had long been a small minority group within the religion, who followed Ismail bin Jafar, an iman who was not recognized by the larger Shiite group, and practiced a faith marked by radical egalitarianism and shunning of the luxury in which the ruling Sunni Abbasid caliphs enjoyed. At the time, the Ismaili sect had long been despised and persecuted by both the Sunnis and other Shiites alike, and they were considered to be revolutionary heretics. Mostly scattered and powerless, this sect had lived on the fringes of Islam for years, secretly preaching their ideology through missionaries known as da’is. It was one of these da’is by the name of Ubayd Allah who would launch a successful revolt to overthrow the local Sunni dynasty of what is now Tunisia and subsequently start the Fatimid caliphate in 910 AD, which quickly went on to conquer Egypt, Palestine, the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and parts of Syriainto, from which they spread their brand of theology.

Hassan-i Sabbah

It was in the base of Ismaili operations that Hassan-i Sabbah was born between 1040 and 1050, and converted to the Ismaili sect as a young man. Charismatic, intelligent, and intense, Hassan quickly rose in prominence within the Ismaili community and garnered a reputation in western Persia as being a firebrand missionary, known for his fierce intelligence, debating skills, fanatical fervor, hot temper, and toughness. It was these qualities that would land him in trouble at times, as he was known to have intense religious arguments with his instructors and he was even arrested at one point to spend a stint in a political prison after offending the local Chief of the Army, Badr al-Jamalī. He was subsequently kicked out of Cairo, where he had received advanced instruction in the ways of missionary work. Nevertheless, despite his exile from Cairo, Hassan went on to be one of Ismaili’s most valued missionaries, carrying out his work all over Persia.

At the time, the Ismailis were somewhat in decline, which was brought about by internal disputes among its leaders, a schism in ideologies, with the group gradually dividing into the Mustali Ismailis and the Nizari Ismailis due to conflict over who should be the heir to the caliphate, and an increasing loss of territory to the intruding Sunni Abbasid caliphs. In his zealous drive to spread the word of his Ismaili sect, Hassan went about trying to create a stronghold, a base of operations from which he and his followers could continue their dangerous work and raise the prominence of their doctrine throughout the region in safety. After traversing the land looking for a suitable location, Sabbah found it in the mountains of northern Persia near the Shah River in the form of an impressive citadel by the name of Alamut, which was perched atop soaring cliffs high above a valley floor, making it virtually inaccessible to enemies. Easily defendable, with a clear view for miles over the landscape below, it was seen as the perfect spot from which to launch their operation.

However, there was a problem. First of all, Alamut belonged to the the Seljuk Empire, who obviously were not just going to give it to them. Second, Hassan and his men were badly outnumbered, and considering that Alamut was well-defended and difficult to reach they had no chance at all of taking it by force. Most would have realized the futility of trying to gain the citadel, but for Hassan these were merely minor annoyances, and he went about an elaborate campaign to just go ahead and steal it anyway. The first step to this plan involved sending out missionaries into the surrounding areas in order to fan out and win over converts from the local populace, especially village leaders and other people of prominence. The next step was more daring, with Sabbah and his men actually secretly infiltrating the citadel and converting members of the defending garrison.

The commander of the fort began to suspect something suspicious was going on, but he was powerless to do anything about it because by that time most of the garrison and the local populace had already converted to the Ismaili cause and now followed Hassan. Outnumbered and outmaneuvered, the commander had no choice but to surrender the fort, and thus after nearly two years of patiently enacting his plan, Hassan had gained his prize without bloodshed or violence. The account of the taking of Alamut has often been romanticized. One popular legend concerning the acquisition of Alamut is that Hassan offered the owner of the fort 3,000 dinars for an amount of land that could fill a buffalo hide. The owner accepted, thinking that this would turn him over a tidy profit, after which Hassan cut a buffalo hide into long, thin strips which he then linked together around the perimeter of the fort before paying the promised money and sending the outsmarted owner on his way.

With Alamut secured, Hassan knew that it was only a matter of time before the Seljuks would come to take it back, and indeed an enraged Seljuk emir came rampaging through the valley in revenge, destroying towns, razing crops, and brutally slaughtering any Ismailis he could find, but Alamut proved to be just as impenetrable as Hassan had hoped, repelling the attack and sending the emir home in frustrated defeat. In the aftermath of this attack, with many of the crops and homes in the valley lying in smoking ruin, Hassan launched a campaign to increase his presence and capture other fortified positions within the region, sometimes through tact or propaganda and at other times through force, until he had created practically his own miniature state. As the Ismaili presence in the region spread, the Seljuks began to realize the threat they posed and decided on a more powerful response. Two armies were dispatched to the region to squash the Ismailis and Alamut was held under siege, yet Hassan in his impregnable fortress was able to ultimately thwart all such aggression. It was at around this time that he would turn to a new way to fight his enemies, and which would lead to the formation of his order of assassins.

It came to Hassan’s attention that one of his worst enemies, a Vizier Nizam al-Mulk, was traveling from the Seljuk capital of Isfahan to the Abbasid caliph’s residence in Baghdad along with the Sultan Malik Shah. Hassan then sent one of his most trusted assistants, a young man named Bu-Tahir, to infiltrate the entourage dressed as a Sufi mystic and armed with a concealed dagger. On the morning of October of 1092, when Nizam had just finished having breakfast with the Sultan and was on his way back to his tent, the disguised Bu-Tahir approached with a paper in his hand, claiming it was a petition that he wanted the vizier to look at. When Nizam reached out for it, Bu-Tahir grabbed him and fatally stabbed him through the heart before being promptly subdued and killed by the vizier’s men. Although this operation had left its agent dead, it had fulfilled its purpose and had a powerful psychological effect on the Seljuks, and indeed any others who would oppose Hassan. The Ismailis had shown that they had the ability and the determination and fearlessness to silently reach out and deal death as they pleased, despite their inferior numbers and relatively small territory.

Encouraged by the success of this first assassination, Hassan went about forging an elite group of individuals who could be called upon to undertake similar missions. Recruits for this new group were gathered from among Hassan’s own men, as well as the surrounding villages. The most prized traits in these potential recruits were resourcefulness, intelligence, ruthlessness, fearlessness, and religious zeal. In some cases, it is said that young boys were recruited, who could be more completely indoctrinated and trained in the ways of death. The recruits were trained in the use of various weapons, hand-to-hand combat, stealth, disguise, intelligence gathering, and psychological warfare, but the most important training they received was the the intense ideological commitment and fanaticism which was fostered within them through constant bombardment of propaganda and religiously fired up speeches. Hassan sought to make them totally obedient to him and the cause, going to great lengths to convince them that he was their one true savior, and that only by dying under his servitude would they achieve heavenly bliss.

At the end of all of this training, ideally the recruit would have been transformed into a stealthy, deadly killer who was disciplined, fanatical, totally committed to his cause, not afraid to die, and ready to follow any orders given without question. Such newly forged human weapons of war were called the fidaiyn, which roughly translates to “sacrifice,” or more to the point “those who risk their lives voluntarily,” and which is typically spelled today as fedayeen. This group of assassins would then go on to be called the Hashashin, which means “followers of Hassan,” and is the word from which the English word “assassin” likely originates.

Since much of the history of how this group was really trained is lost or has been tainted and clouded by the biased observations of the Crusaders, European explorers, and most notably the accounts of Marco Polo, which are probably mixed with some amount of fanciful fiction, there have been many legends that have sprung up about their training methods. For instance, it was said that the assassin recruit would be tricked into thinking they had died, only to wake up in a luxurious, opulent garden, which they would think was heaven. There Hassan would be waiting for them and the recruit would think he was some divine entity with the power to send them back to the land of the living, thus cementing their loyalty. Other stories explain that young boys spent all of their time in this garden, living in luxury until they were cast out and told that if they did not obey their master they would never return. In another tale, Hassan was said to have lowered a man into a hole in the ground with only his head showing, which was then surrounded with blood to make it seem as if he had been decapitated. The recruits were then shown the head and Hassan would appear to make the “head” speak and move, thereby proving in their minds that their master had great powers. To make it seem even more convincing, when the recruits left the room, Hassan supposedly had the cooperative person actually killed and decapitated, his head paraded about on a pole in order to show that he was really dead. It was also said that the assassins constantly smoked hashish, which you most likely know as marijuana, in order to take the edge off, make them more easily manipulated, and increase fearlessness. In fact, it is this tale that has given rise to the idea that the name Hashashin actually comes from the Arabic word hashishi, meaning “hashish users,” although this would have been very against the Muslim tradition of eschewing intoxicants. It is uncertain just how much truth any of these stories hold, but it shows how much power the Hashashin had to fire up the imagination.

When they were finally sent into the field, the Hashashin, or Assassins, were extremely bold, preferring to attack targets in very public areas with a lot of bystanders, such as mosques or city streets, in order to strengthen the psychological impact of their strikes, cultivate their sinister reputation, and sow terror, although they went through great lengths to ensure that no innocent person was harmed. In fact, it was very important to them that innocents be spared and that there be no killing of those not specifically targeted. This habit of killing where many could witness the act ensured that word of mouth spread quickly and further showed everyone that the Hashashin could be anywhere at anytime. Killings were meticulous and almost always carried out with a close quarter weapon such as a dagger, and they avoided any weapons which would allow the victim to possibly escape, such as bows or poisons. This was all done with complete lack of fear, and although the Assassin would try to escape if they could, they were not afraid to die at the hands of their enemy, although they would never commit suicide.

Assassinations were not always such straightforward affairs. Sometimes the Assassin would spend years learning the language and culture of the place they wished to infiltrate and getting close to their intended target, penetrating the inner circle and getting through the veil of security. To this end, they were masters of deceit and disguise, using whatever costume or cover they had to in order to patiently and inexorably get within striking distance. Blending in with their enemy, they could be peasants working the fields, soldiers, or loyal trusted servants. They could be anybody. The fact that the Hashashin were not afraid to die and that indeed, considering their high profile targets, were most certainly ensured of it, also added to the terror they invoked. It drove home the fact that there was no escape, and that anyone targeted for assassination was doomed no matter what they did.

On many occasions, the Hashashin did not kill at all, but rather relied on psychological warfare, with which they were well versed. One example of this was to infiltrate the quarters of a person of prominence and leave a dagger upon their pillow, usually with a message such as “You have been warned,” “You are in our grip,” or something menacing to that effect, leaving the potential victim terrified. These sorts of terror tactics were so effective that they allowed the Hashashin to exert influence on political figures or people of prominence without having to rely upon violence at all. In other cases, an assassination would be intentionally botched, with the victim being allowed to escape an attack with just a few injuries, making them very aware that they could be killed at any time and keeping them in the constant grip of fear, sometimes with them resorting to wearing armor under their clothes or keeping bodyguards to watch over them 24 hours a day. Even then, it was never apparent where an attack might come from, and since no one knew who could be an Assassin, since even a bodyguard or trusted advisor or servant could be one, there was a good amount of paranoia. For even the most well-protected and powerful rulers, no one ever knew just which one their faithful entourage might be an Assassin waiting for word to strike.

Assassination attempt on Edward I of England

These terror tactics were remarkably effective, and often just a mere mention of the Hashashin was enough to keep many in line, to keep them submissive without these shadowy assassins having to do anything at all. In many cases, it became easier to just bend to their demands or forms truces with Hassan rather than face the possibility of an attack at any time. This constant threat of assassination and never-ending state of fear instilled in his enemies had a potent deterrent effect, and became a powerful bargaining chip for Hassan, allowing him to wield far more clout against far larger, more formidable enemies than his inferior numbers and relative low military might would suggest. It also ensured that far fewer lives were risked or lost than conventional military action.

The list of victims targeted by the Hashashin included religious leaders, emirs, sharifs, caliphs, high ranking political or military leaders, and just about anyone else who was a potential threat to Hassan or his Ismaili faith, but this list was always changing depending on his agenda. Even the the great Muslim general Saladin faced several attempts on his life by the Hashashin. During the Crusades, the Hashashin had a tenuous relationship with the Crusaders, sometimes working for them and sometimes targeting them, whatever best aided them in maintaining the balance of power or suited their interests. In fact, some of the most famous Hashashin targets came about at this time. One well-known assassination by the Hashashin at this time was that of the Crusader military commander from northern Italy, Conrad of Montferrat, who had been elected King of Jerusalem in April of 1192. Two Hashashin disguised as monks spent 6 months getting close to him, going so far as to convert to Christianity in order to allay any suspicions, before cutting him down as he walked home from a friend’s house escorted by two knights. It has often been speculated that these Assassins had been working for one of his many Christian enemies, such as Richard the Lionheart and Henry of Champagne. Another famous assassination attempt by the Hashashin was that of Edward I of England, who was wounded by a dagger in an ultimately unsuccessful bid to end his life in 1271.

The Hashashin would operate in the region and keep all of the Middle East in the grip of fear for over 125 years, under the guidance of a total of 8 grand masters. Their reign of fear was all encompassing, but all things must come to an end. Towards the beginning of the 13th century, a terrifying new power was sweeping across the land, the armies of the Mongols, under their ferocious leader Genghis Kahn, against whom the Hashashin would ultimately prove to be powerless. At first, the Hashashin had little to worry about. Although the Mongol armies were laying waste to vast swaths of central Asia between 1219 and 1223, the Hashashin remained relatively unaffected, with the Mongols’ attention focused elsewhere. However, Genghis Khan’s grandson, Mongke Khan, began to set his sights on invading Islamic territory and hoped to eventually conquer Baghdad. When the Hashashin learned of this new threat, they made an attempt to assassinate Mongke by sending a team of assassins to pose as citizens offering submission and surrender to the warlord before killing him. Things did not go according to plan. The team was turned away by the suspicious guards and the assassination was a failure. It was with this close call, in addition to word spreading to the Mongols of the deadly threat posed by the Hashashin, that they became more interested in wiping this shadowy, lethal group out. Mongke ordered his brother, Hülegü Khan, to go to Alamut and decisively destroy the Hashashin sect once and for all. In early 1256, the Mongols came at the Hashashin in their Alamut fortress with all of their might, and they were smashed under such a relentless force. The Hashashin grandmaster at the time, a Khur-Shah, who was considered to be rather weak willed compared to his predecessors, desperately tried to negotiate with the invading Mongols, offering his surrender in exchange for mercy, but the enemy did not honor this bargain and slaughtered the grandmaster in the wilds. They then went about hunting down and killing any Assassins or indeed any Ismailis they could find in a ruthless orgy of blood. The remaining Hashashin were scattered all over Asia, including India, Afghanistan, and the Himalayas, and their age ended.

In the ensuing madness, the stronghold of the Hashashin, Alamut, was razed to the ground and its vast libraries and records totally destroyed, leaving us with an incomplete picture of their history and practices. Indeed when looking at the saga of the Hashashin order of assassins, its history is murky, muddied by the accounts of the Crusaders, who were largely ignorant of Muslim culture and prone to exaggeration and romanticization of the order, as well as unreliable accounts by explorers such as Marco Polo, which were exaggerated and colored to the point where it is difficult to disentangle fact from fiction. Their history remains shadowy, cloaked in legend, myths, misinformation, and misunderstanding. The dramatic notion of an outnumbered secret society of assassins causing their more powerful enemies to cower before their might with the threat of stealthy agents of death certainly lends itself to exaggeration and legend, and when looking at their history, the lack of any solid information certainly makes it difficult to get a clear picture of the reality of this shadowy group. It is easy to get caught up in the swashbuckling cinematic quality of it all. In modern times, this romantic, dramatized view of the Hashashinin can still be seen in popular culture, such as in the popular video game Assassin’s Creed.

Yet for all of the misinformation and gaps in our knowledge of the Hashashin and their ways, they most certainly did exist. Perhaps the Hashashin’s legacy in the modern world can best be seen in the turmoil it faces. After all, they were the first pioneers of using terror tactics, insidious psychological warfare, the use of cells embedded within their enemies ready to strike, and suicide attacks, which can all still be seen in terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and al Qaeda, although the Hashashin would have no doubt frowned upon the blatant imperiling of innocent bystanders that seems to be common practice today. The Hashashin have also proved to be the potential inspiration behind various other secret cults and societies, having a pronounced impact on how we see these secretive groups and how they operate. Author West Moore said of this in his book Disinformation:

During the Crusades, the Hashshashins fought both for and against the Crusaders, whichever suited their agenda. As a result, the Crusaders brought back to Europe the Assassins’ system, which would be passed down and mimicked by numerous secret societies in the West. The Templars, the Society of Jesus, Priory de Sion, the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, etc. all owe their organizational efficiency to Hasan.

We may never have a full, clear picture of this mysterious order of assassins. The Hashashin remain just as shadowy in death as they were in life, with their myth and legend overshadowing any truths that we are able to glean from them. Now they are just a dark, romanticized footnote in history, but in their day the Hashashin were one of the most secretive, ingenious, and deadly secret orders in the world, their mere presence enough to shift the balance of power and change history, the potential for death to come for anyone at any time enough to influence politics and mold ancient Persia. They remain a fascinating account of a secret society that not only thrived, but was a powerful transforming force of history.

"In fact it’s been a week since my previous blog post. We’ve had the total lunar eclipse last Wednesday and observations from Hanoi were not so much disappointing, despite the inherent urban light pollution. In my case I was observing from the rooftop of our house in Dao Tan, Hanoi located close to the Lotte shopping center and didn’t manage to spot the totality of this eclipse due to aforementioned reasons.

Therefore I was waiting on the rooftop as sun was setting and scrutinizing the surrounding with my pair of binoculars. Although the Moon was not seen in the sky at the times when it was supposed to be above the horizon, I was still waiting to to encounter the remaining part of this amazing natural phenomenon. Clock was ticking and it passed the threshold 18:22h -local time, when the full phase of the eclipse was supposed to end and there was yet no sign of Moon. As I mentioned before the urban city lights contributed to create atmospheric fog and block the torrents of photons that were being reflected from Moon. Then the skyscrapers in the city added to that by disguising the horizon and making it almost impossible to detect Moon as it slowly rose above the horizon.

Soon afterwards, around 18:30h- local time, Moon began to be seen and that kept me busy for a while. I’m sharing herewith some photos that I managed to capture during the remainder of this lunar eclipse. Please mind the quality of the photos as they’ve been taken by my mere iPhone which is not the best type of device for this kind of activity.

Union, SRS security contractor still at odds after 2 weeks

Striking security worker John Emery, right, pickets with other workers at the Savannah River Site Tuesday afternoon August 15, 2017 in Jackson, SC. The main sticking points in negotiations with Centerra were an increase in insurance premiums and changes in how the company handles employee transfers. MICHAEL HOLAHAN/STAFF

George Parks, chief steward of United Professional Pro-Force of Savannah River, Local 125, broke ranks and did not go on strike. He received a threatening letter at his home and has been ostracized at work. The union president says he’ll be kicked out when the strike is over.

Mathias Miller, president of United Professional Pro-Force of Savannah River, Local 125, says Centerra-SRS is trying to take rights from workers.

Nobody’s getting what they wanted.

The president of the union that represents security workers at Savannah River Site says the company they work for, Centerra-SRS, is trying to strip rights from workers as it prepares to seek a new contract with the Department of Energy in 2019.

The union’s chief steward, who helped negotiate the contract, is not striking and says members were misled about the contract and the strike was called too hastily. Striking workers are figuring that out and returning to work every day, he says.

The company says it negotiated in good faith and the result was “the most lucrative Protective Force Collective Bargaining Agreement ever proposed at a DOE Site anywhere in the country.” It wants to let striking workers know they are not locked out and can come back to work anytime.

As the strike marks its 15th day today, the two sides seem no closer to resolution than when it began.

The company wants workers to change their minds on the “last, best and final offer.” The union wants the company to bend on health insurance co-pays and a provision it says would let the company change the agreement “mid-stream.”

Meanwhile, striking workers have no benefits, unless they buy their own health insurance through the federal COBRA program. No new negotiations have been started, and the union says the strike will continue until it gets “back to the table” with Centerra.

The chief steward, George Parks, is paying a high price for breaking ranks. He says he’s received threats and has become an outcast among his brotherhood. Mathias Miller, president of United Professional Pro-Force of Savannah River, Local 125, says Parks will be kicked out when it’s all over because he’s an executive board member and should support the union’s position.

“It hurts a little that guys whose children I’ve held, who I’ve represented in arbitration, are yelling at me when I drive by,” said Parks, who has worked at SRS more than 30 years and was elected to the executive board three times. Coming in to work a couple of days before the strike, a fellow worker said to him: “You’re going the wrong way, aren’t you?”

After someone put a threatening letter in Parks’ mailbox at home, he filed a report with the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office, which now routinely patrols past his house.

“You should be ashamed of yourself standing in front of the Union body and taking up for the company,” the letter, laced with racial epithets, read. “We know where you live and hang out and we will handle business with (you) real soon!”

“The letter was not signed and was not in an envelope, which suggests that someone hand-delivered the letter to the mailbox,” a deputy wrote in his report.

Parks said he’s doing what’s best for his family.

“I believe in the right to strike, and to be pro-union, but I have to be able to live with myself and do what’s right,” he said.

In contract negotiations, issues are addressed one at a time and when there’s agreement between union and company, they’re codified in a temporary agreement signed by both parties, Parks said. A series of temporary agreements eventually becomes the contract, and there were no hangups over policies, just money, he said.

“A lot of people didn’t read the contract, and they were told ‘You gotta be a fool to vote for this contract. It’s all take-aways,’” Parks said.

He believes he did a good job in negotiating, and defended the contract, knowing he would suffer for it, he said.

“As we speak right now, people are coming back to work,” Parks said last week. “They’re trickling in. I don’t believe they were educated about what happens during a strike.”

The company says more than 40 union members either did not strike or have returned. Miller, the union president, said he only knows of 32.

Here’s a brief look at two key sticking points that led to the strike:

Healthcare: The new contract would have instituted co-pays —$15 to visit a primary physician, $30 for a specialist — something workers didn’t have to pay before, Miller said. Out-of-pocket maximums would have been not more than $1,000 for an individual, not more than $2,000 for a family. Some visits or procedures might require a “co-insurance” payment of about 10 percent up front, and would count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. Actual premiums can’t be calculated until actuaries tally the claims from the past 24 months and forecast the amount of money needed to pay future claims, according to Centerra. The company pays 83 percent of the premium for an individual and 78 percent for a family. The union says the company would not give it an estimate of how much premiums might rise, but Centerra issued a news release Thursday that said it would likely be $3 a week for an individual, $9 for a family. Parks said he thinks that’s not too much for workers earning $80,000 to $100,000 a year.

Amending the collective bargaining agreement: The union’s president says the contract “basically says if there’s a change in future that would normally be negotiated — if company and union can’t agree, there would a shortened negotiation and if that wasn’t successful the company could implement the change,” essentially voiding the contract. Centerra says any such changes would be dictated only by circumstances or changes in the company’s mission. The union would be notified and could negotiate. Either party could seek mediation, and if it failed, expedited non-binding arbitration. If that didn’t work, “the Company then could implement changes in accordance with the Company’s contractual obligations to the Government.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The first major version of the scalable timeseries database I work on, Gnocchi, was a released a few months ago. In this first iteration, it took a rather naive approach to data storage. We had little ideas about if and how our distributed back-ends were going to be heavily used, so we stuck to the code of the first proof-of-concept written a couple of years ago.

Recently we got more feedbacks from our users, ran a few benchmarks. That gave us enough feedback to start investigating improving our storage strategy.

Data Split

Up to Gnocchi 1.3, all data for a single metric are stored in a single gigantic file per aggregation method (min, max, average…). This means that the file can grow to several megabytes in size, which makes it slow to manipulate.For the next version of Gnocchi, our first work has been to rework that storage and split the data into smaller parts.

The diagram above shows how data are organized inside Gnocchi. Until version 1.3, there would have been only one file for each aggregation methods.

In the upcoming 2.0 version, Gnocchi will split all these data into smaller parts, where each data split is stored in a file/object. This allows us to manipulate smaller pieces of data and to increase the parallelism of the CRUDoperations on the back-end – leading to large speed improvement.

In order to split timeseries into several chunks, Gnocchi defines a maximum number of N points to keep per chunk, to limit their maximum size. It then defines a hash function that produces a non-unique key for any timestamp. It makes it easy to find in which chunk any timestamp should be stored or retrieved.

Data Compression

Up to Gnocchi 1.3, the data stored for each metric is simply serialized using msgpack, a fast and small serialization format. However, this format does not provide any compression. That means that storing datapoints needs 8 bytes for a timestamp (64 bits timestamp with nanosecond precision) and 8 bytes for a value (64 bits double-precision floating-point), plus some overhead (extra information and msgpack itself).

The first technique I implemented is easy enough and is inspired from delta-of-delta encoding. Instead of storing each timestamp for each data point, and since all the data points are aggregated on a regular interval, we transpose points to be the time difference divided by the interval. For example, the suite of timestamps timestamps =[41230, 41235, 41240, 41250, 41255] is encoded into timestamps =[41230, 1, 1, 2, 1], interval = 5. This allows regular compression algorithms to reduce the size of the integer list using run-length encoding.

The XOR based compression scheme described in the Gorilla paper mentioned above – that I had to implement myself. For reference, it also exists a Go implementation in go-tsz.

I then benchmarked these solutions:

The XOR algorithm implemented in Python is pretty slow, compared to LZ4. Truth is that python-lz4 is fully implemented in C, which makes it fast. I've profiled my XOR implementation in Python, to discover that one operation took 20% of the time:count_lead_and_trail_zeroes, which is in charge of counting the number of leading and trailing zeroes in a binary number.

I tried 2 Python implementations of the same algorithm (and submitted them to my friend and Python developer Victor Stinner by the way).

The first version, using string search with .index() is 10× faster than the second one that only does integer computation. Ah, Python… As Victor explained, each Python operation is slow and there's a lot in the second version, whereas.index() is implemented in C and really well optimized and only needs 2 Python operations.

Finally, I ended up optimizing that code by leveraging cffi to use directly ffsll() andflsll(). That decreased the run-time of count_lead_and_trail_zeroes by 45 %, making the entire XOR compression code speed increased by a small 7%. This is not enough to catch up with LZ4 speed. At this stage, the only solution to achieve a high-speed would probably to go with a full C implementation.

Considering the compression ratio of the different algorithms, they are pretty much identical. The worst case scenario (random values) for LZ4 compress down to 9 bytes per data point, whereas XOR can go down to 7.38 bytes per datapoint. In general XOR encoding beats LZ4 by 15%, except for cases where all values are 0 or 1. However, LZ4 is faster than XOR by a factor of 4×-70×depending on cases.

That means that we'll use LZ4 for data compression in Gnocchi 2.0. It's possible that we could achieve as fast compression/decompression algorithm, but I don't think it's worth the effort right now – it'd represent a lot of code to write and to maintain.

Don't sleep on Enny Romero. I think there is a better chance of him providing impact in the bullpen, but I've been working on the Rays system lately and scouts really like this kid's stuff; I've seen it several times myself, so I can definitely appreciate a mid-90s FB and hard breaking ball from a southpaw. The command concerns, but if he can develop into an effectively wild type, he has the stuff to pitch above the middle-of-a-rotation. Projection is #2/3 type, but I think a late-innings arm is the realistic role. (Jason Parks)

Robbie Erlin closed the season 32 IP 1.96 ERA 1.06 WHIP 24 K 7 BB, but with the Josh Johnson signing appears out of the mix in SD. Kennedy, Ross, Johnson, and Cashner are givens. Then you have Stults, Luebke, Wieland, and Burch Smith to contend with. What does SD do? Trade Cashner? Just keep the depth in AAA?(Joe Rockpile from Tuscaloosa)

Keep. The. Depth. JJ and Cash are both health risks, and an outstanding name combo for a late 70s buddy cop show. (Harry Pavlidis)

Do you think Aroyds Vizcaino is a good bet to contribute in 2014? What about Padres pitching prospects Robbie Erlin and Joe Wieland? Any chance any are rotation bound next year? I've got them all as minor leaguers in a deep NL-only 12 team keeper league, hoping at least one pans out as a middle of the rotation arm. (brokenarrow from Texas)

I'm done on Vizcaino, never really loved him. He's gotta prove something to me. LOVE Erlin and like Wieland as well. I think both can contribute, maybe even later this year if needs arise for SD, but definitely next year. (Paul Sporer)

Hey, John. Professor Parks and the minor-league gang probably have a better read on this stuff, but if you're looking for raw peripherals, Blackburn does seem to fit the bill. Two others to keep an eye on: Rangers RHP Cody Buckel, who found a groove late after struggling initially in Double-A, and Padres LHP Robert Erlin. (Daniel Rathman)

"Santana struck out the Colorado side in the first. He executed a hit and run, made it from first to third on a single, and didn't let 110 pitches over the first eight innings stop him from taking the mound in the ninth.

On any other gray and drizzly day, a four-hit shutout would've made the sky above Citi Field a blissful shade of blue. But nothing could make you feel good about the Mets on Thursday, not with their closer coming out of the wrong kind of pen and escorted by police into a criminal courthouse, his hands cuffed behind his back.

Francisco Rodriguez was arrested for allegedly pummeling his girlfriend's father after Wednesday night's loss, charged with third-degree assault, and suspended by the Mets for two days, making Santana's willingness to go the distance all the more profound.

But the ace didn't qualify as some superhero swooping in out of a comic book, not after a woman who had accused him of rape sued him in a Florida court.

Yes, only the Mets could temporarily divert your attention away from a pitcher accused of assault with a brilliant performance from a pitcher accused of worse.

""I'm done with that,"" Santana said. ""I'm not commenting on that.""

The Mets were willing to comment on Rodriguez, and maybe they should've gone the Santana route. If more evidence was needed to prove this organization lacks organization, it was found in the way Manuel and Jeff Wilpon handled the K-Rod case.

Aristide Economopoulos/The Star-Ledger/US PresswireJerry Manuel was all smiles with Santana during the game, but his comments after the game were bewildering.

Rodriguez was held in custody at a holding facility at Citi Field after Wednesday night's altercation, held there after he allegedly sent his girlfriend's father to the hospital. Yet when asked before the game if he would have any hesitation using Rodriguez if the closer showed up at the ballpark free of handcuffs, Manuel said, ""None.""

Good heavens. Of all the surreal quotes Manuel has delivered into a live mike during his term, this one syllable trumped them all.

Nope, not a single millisecond of pause to hand the ball to a pitcher who had embarrassed the franchise, who had exhibited anger-management issues in the past, and who had spent the night in a pen that doesn't swing open when a baseball manager calls.

An hour after Manuel spoke, the Mets announced they had suspended Rodriguez for two days without pay. ""Ownership and the organization are very disappointed in Francisco's inappropriate behavior,"" Wilpon said, ""and we take this matter very seriously.""

So in one New York minute, the manager says he'd go right back to K-Rod if Santana needed relief, and in the next the team owner is removing the closer from the roster.

It gets better. Armed with knowledge of the suspension and Wilpon's stated sentiment in his postgame news conference, Manuel came up with this beauty:

""I don't have all the facts. Until I have all the facts, then I make a judgment as to how I feel about it and so forth. But I just think right now it's unfair when everything is not on the table to make a judgment one way or another. Despite what the team did, I still feel that way.""

In effect, Manuel called Wilpon's suspension of Rodriguez ""unfair.""

The manager declined to say he was angry at K-Rod; he maintained he needed to hear the whole story before he took his own temperature. Manuel acknowledged the incident and the arrest disappointed him, but added, ""You still have to weigh what spurred such an action. That has to be a part of it, despite that it's wrong.""

In other words, if K-Rod can convince Manuel that the man he allegedly assaulted had it coming to him, well play ball!

Manuel didn't get it, even if some of his players did.

""No one should act like that,"" Carlos Beltran said of Rodriguez. ""It doesn't matter if the team did whatever it did. No one should act like that. He feels sorry about what happened, but it's too late.""

Good for Beltran. Good for the center fielder to recognize the urgency of a matter Manuel didn't bother to address with his team.

Of course, the bad karma gripping the Mets involves far more than this latest confrontation on K-Rod's résumé, a résumé that lists as references Tony Bernazard, Randy Niemann and Brian Bruney.

The Mets are a .500 team in name only. Just as John Mara angrily pointed out that last year's 8-8 Giants had the feel of a 4-12 team, this year's 57-57 Mets have the feel of a 50-64 team.

Normally an inconspicuous presence, Mara assumed a leadership role when he stepped before the cameras and notebooks and ripped every Tom, Dick and Jerry in his employ.

But Jeff Wilpon didn't hold a news conference Thursday, when another Same Old Mets crisis begged for his face-to-face thoughts on a season spinning out of control.

The owner settled for a typed one-sentence rebuke of K-Rod, and if nothing else, it sounded a whole lot better than what was coming out of Manuel's mouth.

Truth is, the Mets need a new and dynamic force in the worst way, something stronger than an adviser who can knock down Omar Minaya's bad ideas. Joe Torre was offered as an answer in this space, and if the Dodgers manager does indeed become a free agent, the Mets will give him some thought.

Torre? Bobby Valentine? Cliff Lee? Billy Beane? The Mets desperately need a grand slam between now and Opening Day, 2011, and surprise, surprise: The number of grand slams they've hit this year matches the amount of consideration Manuel would've given to benching a freed K-Rod.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Once the roles were reversed. Four hundred years ago, as Christian Europe became engulfed in religious conflict, a stable, prosperous Muslim superpower looked on with interest. The emergence of Protestantism threatened the hegemony of the Ottoman Empire’s longtime Catholic rivals as well as the stability of Istanbul’s trading partners. The Ottomans teamed up with the Protestants, fighting Poland on behalf of rebellious Bohemia, and providing others with indirect covert support in wars against common enemies.

Even in the 20th century Middle East , the secular Gamal Abdul Nasser sought to overthrow the Islamist Saudi monarchy in the 1960s and launched a war in north Yemen against Saudi-backed rivals.

The point, among the six « lessons » drawn from a wide-angle view of history by John Owen in Confronting Political Islam, is that foreign interventions are inevitable at times of grand, transnational ideological upheaval. They are not simply the result of imperial ambitions but of rational self-interest. « When one or more countries is undergoing civil unrest that could produce a regime change, outside countries often have a strategic or material stake in the outcome, » he writes.

Owen, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, applies lessons gleaned from the great western conflicts to what he describes as the decades-long conflict between secularism and Islamism in the greater Middle East. In an animated, ambitious and thoughtful book, he focuses on the unrest that engulfed early modern Europe with the rise of Protestantism, the century-long struggle between absolute monarchy and republicanism in western Europe and North America; and the often-bloody struggle between liberalism, communism and fascism that ravaged the 20th century.

He describes the struggle between secularism and political Islam as similar in scale and stakes to those three epochal conflicts, with secularists holding the upper hand from the 1920s to the 1960s and Islamists gaining ground since.

In dealing with the rise of political Islam, he cautions policy makers never to underestimate the longevity of what they may consider a « backward » ideology, noting the constant flare-ups of Europe’s sectarian wars and the broad appeal of communism and fascism even among intellectuals in the liberal west.

Policy makers must step carefully before trying to co-opt Islamist moderates and isolate radicals. He cites US policy in cold war Europe, where Washington partnered with French socialists but wrote off Italy’s as hopelessly wedded to Moscow.

In the west’s three grand ideological battles, he writes, twice there was no winner. Europe transcended its sectarian conflict by adopting a secular model, like that of Holland, over papist or protestant rule. Battles between republicanism and monarchy led to Britain’s hybrid model, neither absolute monarchy nor radical republic. In the battle between fascism and communism, liberalism eventually won out, with the US defeating Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. Why? Owen says the success or failure of bellwether states determines how an ideological conflict will turn out. American capitalism won out, for example, because it was economically and internationally successful.

In the battle between Islamism and secularism Owen identifies Islamist Iran and secular Turkey as the bellwether states to watch. This is problematic. Though they have been heralded at times in the past decade, both countries are mistrusted by many Sunni Arabs, who make up the bulk of the Middle East.

Owen’s book is stimulating and useful but it cannot account for the indecipherable tangle that emerges when ideological, national and local actors and interests become jumbled.

In today’s Middle East hundreds of local forces are at play, from the Berber of north Africa to the Kurdish resurgence in the Levant; from al-Qaeda in the Maghreb to Hizbollah in Lebanon – not to mention tribal and regional conflicts within countries.

It is a limitation Owen knows well. « There is no substitute, » he writes, « for the deep study of Muslims and Islam on their own terms – their theologies, cultures and histories. »

"Workers fight closure of Bronx Stella Doro plant

The union that represents 136 workers at the Stella Doro Biscuit Co. has filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board in an attempt to stop the companys planned shutdown of a Bronx factory.

In a second move, the union petitioned the NLRB to ask a federal judge to issue an injunction that would prevent private equity firm Brynwood Partners, which manages the investment fund that owns the company, from closing the factory. It also asked the city to intervene to keep the factory open, or to recover money in the form of tax abatements that the plant has received.

The workers had been on strike since walking off their jobs last August. Late last month a judge ruled that the company had violated labor law and ordered the workers reinstated with back pay to May 6. The workers returned to their jobs last week, but on the same day, Stella Doro announced it was shutting the factory in three months because the union had failed to make any meaningful concessions that would stop the company from losing money.

The union is also seeking to reopen negotiations over both the expired collective bargaining agreement and Stella Doro officials decision to close the plant and relocate production.

The company cannot simply ignore the decision of a federal administrative law judge and it cannot punish the workers at Stella Doro for exercising their rights under law, said Joyce Alston, president of Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Local 50.

Calls to Stella Doro, Brynwood and their attorney, Mark Jacoby, were not returned. The company released a statement last week charging union leadership with failing to grasp that any business that cannot operate profitably must seek changes that will enable it to do so.

Elbert Tellem, the assistant regional director of the NLRB, confirmed the unions filings, but would not otherwise comment.

Labor lawyer Michael Weber, a senior partner at Littler Mendelson, said the workers attempt to link the closing to union activity was not surprising. They could argue it, but if the company can show legitimate business reasons for their actions, they have every right to go where they can operate profitably, he said.

The former regional director of the NLRB, Dan Sullivan, said that because Stella Doro indicated that it was not going out of business completely and would continue to produce products after the shutdown, the union may have a case. They have to prove the reason for closing was union activity and not, as the employer says, economic motivation, he said.

He said the union would likely point to the timing of the plant closing announcement, which occurred soon after the judges decision, and that the company would continue to stand by the position that it was losing money.

A spokesman for Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the mayor appointed a mediator in April, but that the two sides were unable to resolve their differences. He said the tax abatements Stella Doro received are available to any business that builds or renovates a facility and that theyre not contingent on creating or maintaining jobs.

Review

Great movie, highly recommended

10/10 It's a great movie, very touching. The background is Nanking Massacre, at that cruel and desperate history moment, the director finds a special perspective to show us goodness, hope, sacrifice and humanity. Although I've seen so many war movies before, this one is different. I could not help crying through the whole movie, even I told myself ""This is just another war movie, you should control your tears"" But the movie has nothing to do with intendedly giving audience slushy emotional scenes. Even at some dark and sad moments, there is no background music.

All the actors and actresses give a stellar performance. Good story, good acting, beautiful scene. My teacher once said ""Audience never cry for tragedy，but they will cry for good things.""

Anyway, it's a powerful movie, highly recommended.

PS: All the victims in Nanking Massacre deserve a serious apology from Japanese.

a movie definitely worth seeing

10/10 Honestly,I am not the kind of people easily being touched so deeply as to cry, and I didn't cry much during the movie indeed. I just walked out the movie theater,took a bus,got off the bus,bought a piece of bread, walked home while eating the bread,then all of sudden burst into tears.

Till now I still haven't walked out of it. There is so much to say, yet you don't know what to say nor how to say it. My only advice: you walk into the movie theater, forget whatever people said on the Internet, and just watch it with your own heart.

It is a great movie.

Don't miss. This deserves your attention.

9/10 Zhang Yimou has crafted a beautifully shot and compelling story set inside horrific events. About all I knew of this movie was it was set in 1937 China and starred Christian Bale. Not knowing much allowed me to be completely open to the journey of the characters. This is an emotionally powerful story about people caught in circumstances for which there seems no hope of survival. The Japanese soldiers are shown as barbaric, but we do meet an officer who attempts to remain honorable though he must do his duty to his superiors. The violence in the movie is brutal, but not graphic or gratuitous. The choices and sacrifices made by the characters never seemed contrived. The arc of Christian Bale's character may seem 'predictable', but it is never false or 'convenient' to the story. All actors are excellent. Because they're foreign to me I had no idea who they are or their other work. At the screening I attended we were introduced to Ni Ni, who said this was her first film. She is both beautiful and compelling. I wish her a long career. Yimou, through his daughter, told us about his journey to make this movie - based on a novel, based on real events. He has told an amazing story that will stay with me for a long time.

Good Movie is Like a Mirror

10/10 I watched the movie in Beijing, twice. The second time I liked it more. This has to be one of the best Chinese films yet, if not the best. Some scenes are pretty brutal, but really worth watching, to say the least.

The director Zhang YiMou told a powerful, touching and beautiful story, while delivering stunning visual effects as always. All actors from different countries did an amazing job in making so many strong characters in 3 languages, not just the American 'priest', but also those prostitutes, the boy George, all the children, Japanese officers, and the Chinese 'traitor'.

Good movie is like a mirror, some people might get upset watching it, while others see love for others, respect for life, and the human spirit of fighting for peace out of tragedy. Each audience's reaction more or less reflects his/her personal value. The storytelling is objective so you can judge for yourself. In front of a masterpiece like this, people who ranked it very low deliberately because of stereotypes against China or whatever twisted reason (I KNOW YOU EXSIT ON THIS SITE), you need to sit down and think what's wrong with yourself, no matter how open-minded you claim you are.

Some say it is a propaganda production. I have to disagree here. Almost everything in this movie is based on real history, including how Japanese tortured Chinese war victims, how prostitutes stood up to protect other women during the Rape of NanJing, as well as how some westerners resided in China at the time helped local Chinese. Anyone who can pick up a few books or do a bit of research on internet knows it.

English is not my mother language so I can't write an review with big words like those professional critics do. However, this is the first time I feel so moved by a movie that I'd write an English review online to recommend it to viewers outside of China. Simply too good to miss.

If any Chinese simply walked out of the cinema cursing Japanese, I'd say the movie failed big time. However, both times I saw people left quietly, some still sobbing, and heard them saying how lucky they are to be born in this era and how precious peace is. For that reason, I applaud this film.

It is what it is. Horrible things happened in history. Hate and anger won't do any good today. Make peace with yourself and move on. Just like what George said in the movie, life is precious, it is not ours to throw away.

Where does the comedy stop and the drama begin?

9/10 Watched this movie last night in a packed Beijing cinema on its opening night. First off, I would like to say that Christian Bale traces perfectly the path of enlightenment that follows Wild-West style bandit obsessed with money becoming priest and father-figure in all but religious training. The film is in roughly 50% English, 35% Chinese and 15% Japanese, so there is a real assimilation of different languages and cultures coming together. However, this unfortunately leads to some moments which seem disconcertingly humorous. For example, there is one point where a Japanese general confesses to priest-figure Bale that he likes music; the triviality of such statement in the midst of mass-murder seems absurd enough, but it is also delivered in a dead-pan way with broken English. I could not help but burst out laughing, even though none of the Chinese in the cinema saw any form of humour in it. Indeed, I think that as a Westerner watching this film, my emotional response is not as visceral as it would be to a Chinese person. That is only natural, but it leads to a completely different interpretation of the movie. Some of the murder scenes are brutally horrific to a Chinese person, so much so that the wonderful filmography which permeates throughout the movie may not be fully appreciated. The hues are brown and green, earthy, rugged and militaristic for the most part. Yet there are occasionally beautiful trims of colour, the church's stained-glass window, the clothes on the washing line left out to dry. A sign, no doubt, of the beauty of humanity in the midst of dreadful war. It has been suggested this movie is propaganda. I don't know if I entirely agree with that. There is no positive way to spin what was a shameful event in Japan's history, and for what it's worth I think that Zhang Yimou delineates well the soldiers occasional insecurity, homesickness, and humanisation brought on by paranoia and pressure from above. A movie well-worth watching, and which I would like to watch for a second time to re- establish which moment are intentionally humorous, which moments are unintentionally humorous, and which moments are tragic. Kudos for Zhang Yimou for tackling such a visited topic (That of the Nanjing massacre) which a freshness, and even more kudos to Christian Bale for stepping up to the plate and giving in a great performance.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"""The public remarks by President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia at his state of the union address to the Duma demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. missile defense systems in Europe by threatening the placement of Russian mobile missiles and other military action has helped solidify the continued deployment of the European Missile Defense site by the United States of America and its NATO allies.

""These remarks, made the day after the U.S. election, were directed at the President-elect Barack Obama and his new administration. This rhetoric, reminiscent of 20-year-old cold war tactics, has been used in different degrees and at different audiences over the past two years. The European Missile Defense site the Russians are opposing will consist of a U.S. midcourse x-band radar (EMR) in the Czech Republic and 10 U.S. ground-based interceptors in Poland, which will defend most of Europe including the northwest parts of Russia and Moscow as well as protecting the United States from ballistic missiles launched from Iran.

""This past year, former Russian President Vladimir Putin used a similar type of threat prior to the NATO summit in Bucharest, which had an adverse effect and galvanized the Europeans and NATO to endorse the European missile defense site after his remarks. President Putin also used the threatening rhetoric of targeting missiles towards the Czech Republic and Poland prior to each of their formal agreements with the United States to host these missile defense systems and again his statements galvanized both the population and the leadership to move forward with the agreements.

""This particular threat by President Medvedev comes again at the wrong time to the wrong audience, as it is clearly the first test to President-elect Obama. Like his predecessor before him, President Medvedev's intended intimidation will further embed the European Missile Defense site in the next U.S. Administration rather than less and strengthens the unity of Europe with the United States on missile defense.""",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

070 shake

One day, 070 Shake was on the floor searching for quarters. The next, she was in a Miami penthouse.

The 19-year-old singer and rapper from North Bergen, NJ, had never really considered making music, but she’d often soothed her depression by writing poetry. One September day in 2016, a friend mentioned a brother with a recording studio and she felt a tug. Why not marry her words with music?

Stepping into the booth for the first time ever, she recorded “Proud,” an achingly vulnerable reflection on teenage rebellion and rejection over a gently swaying, bittersweet beat.

“At that time I felt like I made no one proud, but I always envisioned myself as a leader,” she says. She posted the song online and social influencer Julieanna “YesJulz” Goddard—who eventually would become Shake’s manager—found it, tweeting, “Where’s this boy?”

“I was like, ‘I’m a girl and I’m here,’” Shake says.

Indeed she is, and she’s not leaving anytime soon. In less than two years, 070 Shake has racked up millions of Soundcloud plays; featured on everyone from Lil Yachty to Fabulous records; appeared onstage alongside artists like Sonny Digital, Pusha T and Desiigner; and garnered praise for her “gritty realness” that places her in a “category of her own” (Highsnobeity). Signing to GOOD Music / Def Jam in 2017, her appeal is obvious—thick with emotion, her smoky voice cuts through a never-ending throng of hollow-voiced public figures obsessed with wealth and superficial pleasures. In a world more consumed than ever with consumption, 070 Shake’s honesty and heart are desperately needed.

“It’s not time for talking about money. We have to talk to people about real shit,” she insists. “If you project these things to people, they are going to think you need that to be happy. No. You need love.”

Growing up, 070 Shake had plenty of love, if not money. Her parents were divorced, and because her mother struggled financially, Shake was sent to live with various family members--the Dominican Republic with her grandmother, Colorado with her aunt and uncle, who writes Christian music.

She listened mostly to rock music, particularly John Mayer, the Beatles, Kid Cudi. “I listened to things with feeling,” she says. “The Beatles didn’t really care bout materialistic things. I wanna bring it back to that. There’s a difference between music that bumps and music you feel. ‘Imagine’ is one of my favorite lyrical songs. The words are pretty simple, but just the meaning in general.”

In her early adolescence, she sunk into a deep depression, and poetry was her escape. Still, pouring her heart onto the page couldn’t quell her rising rebelliousness, and she soon was getting suspended from high school for pranks like stealing the frogs from the science lab.

Once she graduated, however, she underwent a stark change. Experimenting with psychedelics, she dove into Plato, Socrates and the Bible. “I became a new person. I had 100 tabs on my computer and learned all this on my own. After that I was reborn,” she says. “I felt like I didn’t need all the LSD. Felt like a trip from learning.”

Realizing she had a heart for the kids in her city struggling in an overcrowded school system, she tagged herself “070 Shake” in tribute to her city’s zip code. She started putting music to her poems and “vibing out.” She’d never recorded until “Proud,” but once the seal was broken, she knew she’d found her passion, the way she could change the world—through music.

“I just wanna help people find love. And make everybody happy,” she says. And, perhaps something a little easier to accomplish: “My goal in life is to make my mom proud.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Cocom Delays Rule Change

Reuters

Published: February 27, 1991

PARIS, Feb. 26—
Cocom, the Western trade body that oversees high-technology exports to the former Eastern bloc nations, postponed a high-level meeting this week that was expected to loosen restrictions, trade officials said today.

""The high-level meeting has been deferred because there are a number of technical points still to be resolved,"" said the official, who is close to the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls.

Instead, Cocom officials will use the session, scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, to report on what still needs to be done to put the revisions into effect, the official said. Trade officials could not say when the high-level meeting would take place.

Since 1949, Cocom has restricted exports of high-technology goods with military uses to Communist governments. Last June, it agreed to cut the list of controlled items by a third and to establish a well-defined list of products that could not be exported without a license.

The decision came after reforms in Eastern Europe, and United States officials said at the time that the change should help the new democracies and market economies of the region. But earlier this month trade officials said there had been difficulties in setting up technical specifications.

Cocom, representing all NATO members except Iceland, plus Australia and Japan, has operated a complex system intended to scrutinize all technology exports. The core list would define forbidden items and allow all other products to be traded freely.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"A woman who helped arrange adoptions for an Ohio-based agency pleaded guilty last week to bribing court officials in Uganda and defrauding adoptive parents and the U.S. State Department.

Robin Longoria, 58, of Mansfield, Texas, pleaded guilty in federal court in Ohio to one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to commit wire and visa fraud.

Her sentencing date hasn't been set. She was released on a $20,000 bond.

Longoria and others bribed court registrars and judges in Uganda who would be “adoption-friendly” to her agency's U.S. clients. She paid the bribes through an agent, diguised as ""fees, and hid the bribes from the clients.

Longoria also helped create false documents used to mislead the U.S. State Department in its visa determinations for the Ugandan children being adopted.

An Ugandan lawyer worked with European Adoption Consultants and represented its clients in local court proceedings. The lawyer also helped the clients apply to the State Department for U.S. visas for the children.

""The agency and the attorney facilitated the adoption of more than 30 Ugandan children by U.S. clients between 2013 and 2016, and the agency received more than $800,000 from the clients,"" the report said. Some clients paid more than $10,000.

When the State Department debarred European Adoption Consultants, it had 300 clients at various stages of the adoption process.

After receiving more than 70 complaints, the Ohio attorney general sued European Adoption Consultants in mid 2017. The AG alleged that the agency misled clients and took payment for adoption services it never performed.

"Guest Post: “Not Believing Anything” by C. Luke Mula

C. Luke Mula is the author of The Way to Actuality blog, which was “founded to foster the discussion and discovery of Purpose wherever it can be found, regardless of religious or secular context”. In this essay, Luke shares his experience of a liberating loss of belief and discusses the role that spiritual practice continues to play in his life.

“When thinking leads to the unthinkable, it’s time to return to the simple life. What thinking cannot solve, life does.”

- C.G. Jung, The Red Book

Growing up, I believed a lot of things.

As a faithful member of the Assemblies of God, I believed with varying levels of intensity all of the 16 Fundamental Truths espoused by my denomination. The Resurrection. Speaking in tongues. Second coming of Christ. You name it, I pretty much believed it. And even where I disagreed with the General Council, it was a disagreement based solely on my beliefs and disbeliefs.

My beliefs eventually brought me to a point where, in the middle of a ministerial internship, I had a crisis of religion. I had begun to study the history of Christianity as secular historians saw it, and this more than anything else changed what I thought I knew about God. And it was fucking terrifying. Here I was, being trained to spread the Good News of Jesus Christ, and I was seriously questioning whether or not God even existed. Even worse, I was afraid that my doubting would be found out, and that I would be kicked out of the internship completely. At one point things got so bad that all I could do was cry out in frustration, “Who the fuck are you!?” to God during a time of prayer.

So eventually I let go of my belief in God, but I knew that there were some real things about my experiences of God, and I didn’t want to let go of those experiences. I realized that the mass majority of those experiences gathered around a concept which I called “Purpose,” and that it was by interacting with this greater process in which I was a part that my life seemed to take on meaning. Then, even though I no longer believed in God, I believed very strongly in Purpose, and I could explain my reasons why I believed in it. Purpose was the one thing I held onto in life, and it gave me direction.

One day, however, I sensed strongly that I needed to stop believing even in Purpose. And that scared the shit out of me.

Up until then, I’d stopped believing in a lot of things, but I always felt that I had to believe in Purpose. I mean, if I didn’t, my life was sure to spiral out of control. After all, if I didn’t have that direction, what did I have? The end of this process only seemed like hopelessness to me, and I hated every bit of it. When I sensed that I needed to stop believing in Purpose, tears of fear began to pour out of my eyes. Purpose was the one thing I had left to hold onto, and I was terrified of losing it.

And then a funny thing happened. I did let go. And you know what? It was liberating.

I’ve written in the past that belief is a tool, but oh how far I was from really acting on that idea. Now I can truly say that I don’t believe in anything, and only now can I truly say that I’m free.

Let me make clear what I am not claiming when I say that I don’t believe in anything: I do not mean that I disbelieve everything, nor do I mean that I believe in nothing. When I say that I don’t believe in anything, it simply means that I’m not attached to nor repulsed by any idea. It simply means that I can pick up and let go of any idea, any belief, at will, that I don’t have to believe anything. It means that I’m not even attached to the basic beliefs posed by Hume’s problem of induction: I am equally okay with the world being a creation only of my own mind as I am with it being a reality whose ground is completely external to me. Belief, now more than ever to me, really is a tool.

So in looking back at my past experiences of God and Purpose, I see some things more clearly. My initial, emotional reactions when I’ve let go of God and Purpose have been to drop all practices associated with them. Recently, for about a week, I stopped practicing the devotionals I had discussed with John after his “Spiritual Discipline” post. After all, at the time I started those devotionals, I was doing them to slow down my life and connect with Purpose. Now that I didn’t even believe in Purpose, what good were they?

As soon as I stopped the devotionals, however, I realized something about them: when I practiced them, my life was infinitely better. Without these decidedly mystical practices of meditation, contemplation, and prayer in my life, my life felt extremely hectic, and I was at a loss for making any level of decision with confidence. My base level of well being was so much lower than when these practices were in place, which was noticeable in less than a week after stopping them.

And that’s the thing about all of my experiences of God and Purpose: my beliefs, ideas, and theories about the experiences rarely helped me pursue the experiences to the fullest. In fact, they mostly served to hamper and distort my experiences. It has only been in dropping all beliefs that I have seen how truly valuable my pursuit of God and my relationship with Purpose have been in my life. It is only now that I am truly able to pursue the experiences for their own sake, to truly be honest about what is best for me, not based on any belief or theory, but because only now can I truly come to know myself.

I have been led to the unthinkable, and I have returned to the simple life. What thinking could not solve, life has.

Sounds like your practice has basically become empirical and experimental: just doing the practices, and seeing what happens.

I like to live by a certain maxim: “Never believe anything unless you absolutely cannot help it!” To me, the only beliefs that ought to be adopted are those that are so compelling they are like Athena grabbing Achilles by the hair (scene from the Iliad). It follows that no beliefs should ever need to be *intentionally* adopted. The beliefs themselves should do all the work for you.

C Luke Mula

I know it sounds similar to empiricism, but it’s not. I did take an extremely empirical approach to my practices when I drifted through the New Atheist movement, but empiricism does assume certain things (and is extremely effective towards its goals when it does so). My current position isn’t to experience things for the sake of experimentation or fact-finding. My current position is simply to experience things for the sake of the experience.

Yes, I can be empirical about my experiences when I want to, but I’m not bound to empiricism.

http://allergicpagan.wordpress.com John Halstead

Luke, I know that feeling of terror and the feeling of freedom that come with letting go of one’s deeply held beliefs. I applaud your willingness to really ask “who the fuck God is”, rather than projecting your own ideas of what God should be. I know from experience it is very difficult and it is an ongoing process for me.

Your concluding statement, “What thinking could not solve, life has.”, reminds me of a quote by Kierkegaard: Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced. I continually have to remind myself of that.

I was wondering, as you gradually let go of your beliefs, did the content of your practice change at all? Did you feel any need to or have any difficulty (re-)incorporating symbolism from your previous belief systems?

C Luke Mula

Well, it depends on the context.

For example, for my personal devotionals, I almost always recite the Our Father, with a full belief in what I’m saying. It tends to center me and help me let go of whatever I need to let go of.

When I’m hanging out with atheist friends, though, I am fully engaged in empiricism and religion-mocking. This process is usually quite invigorating and even theraputic.

And then when I attend a Christian worship service, I am fully believing in Jesus Christ as my personal lord and savior, that he was God come to earth as a human to die specifically for my sins, and this belief always shakes me to the core.

In the process of letting go of my beliefs, though, it was usually to grab onto other beliefs, and these other beliefs impended my use of old beliefs. Now, however, all beliefs are fair game to me (though not simultaneously).

http://allergicpagan.wordpress.com John Halstead

Does your practice include any rituals that might seem incompatible with Christianity to more convention Christians? If so, how much do you share? And do you ever feel disingenuous?

http://clukemula.tumbr.com C Luke Mula

Hey, sorry it took me so long to respond to this.

Yes, my practice includes a few rituals that many “conventional” Christians (which in my life are mainly charismatic, fundamentalist Protestants) would at least raise an eyebrow at, and a couple that would seem outright incompatible.

For starters, my “daily devotional” practice probably looks more like generic Zen meditation than anything else, lots of deep breaths, few words and whatnot. I usually kick it off with the Our Father, but the rest of the time is usually spent very very quietly.

As for the outright incompatible, that would be my consultation of the I Ching on an infrequent basis. When Christians find out about this, I usually explain it as “God speaks to me through this book,” as this is an accurate portrayal of my experience from a Christian perspective. They usually still don’t feel comfortable with it and would never teach someone else to do so, though.

And no, I never feel disingenuous. Since I begin at a baseline of complete neutrality to beliefs, when I am practicing with a particular group of people, be it Pentecostal Christians, New Atheists, or Pagans, I am fully there. There is no “core” belief that I can feel I’m betraying by any of these practices, so it is always genuine.

Great questions. I’ve never really articulated any of these things before.

Thanks for sharing Luke. When I left Mormonism and starting creating my own spiritual practice, I felt highly inauthentic — which is why I asked the question. Perhaps that’s not the right word. I mean, I left the LDS Church because I no longer at home in it, but the feeling of being at home in a spiritual practice took years for me to recover. I wondered if it was even possible to dwell authentically in a practice of one’s own making. Of course, now that seems a silly question, but at the time it was real and acute. I suppose that is the legacy of growing up in a religious tradition with rituals handed down to me.

C Luke Mula

Okay, I understand what you mean now.

Yes, there were times when my practice felt inauthentic. When I was practicing with Christians, I had those atheistic beliefs in the back of my mind, and when I was “practicing” with atheists, I had those Christian practices that I knew I participated in even in private. So I didn’t feel I fully belonged to either group, and it was often difficult to fully give myself over to the practices.

At the same time, it was my experiences of God which directly led me out of Christianity, out of atheism, and out of Purpose. So even though my religious practices may have changed, my core experiences were the same.

All this to say that it felt both natural and forced at various times.

I think what you’ve highlighted here is the difference between creedal religions–like Christianity and Islam (and really, those are the only fully creedal religions, though there are creedal elements to others, e.g. Buddhism, Jainism, etc.)–and religions which are based in experience and/or practice, which is most religions worldwide. It never matters what one believes about something, and whether one’s beliefs about something are “right” or “wrong,” “correct” or “incorrect,” what’s important is what actually happens and what one experiences, and the constant readiness of being willing to “do something.” This is a very basic distinction between religions, and one that a lot of people who start out in Christianity and end up in paganism never quite get, unfortunately–the questions isn’t “how many gods” or “what institutional authorities” so much as whether or not one’s religious life is determined by belief or by practice and experience.

I’ve often wondered how belief became so important in Christianity. I’m sure someone has written a book (or many) about it. It seems like a strange idea when you think about it.

http://aediculaantinoi.wordpress.com aediculaantinoi

Sadly, I don’t think there are that many, at least that I’ve been made aware of, anyway. One is James Carse’s The Religious Case Against Belief, which isn’t bad, but it’s been several years since I’ve read it now…

But, yes, the whole creedalism question is a very odd one indeed when it comes to religion. I suspect that a good bit of it has to do with the basic theologies of those monotheistic religion’s deities: they’re omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and so forth, as well as omnibenevolent AND transcendent. Thus, ideas about the unknowability, ineffability, and inscrutability of this deity also come about. The basic theodicy questions come along (and are in various ways summarily dismissed), and then the only refuge people have is to “believe” what they’re told about this deity who is all-powerful, but also all-loving, and yet not at all involved directly in the lives of most people nor accessible to them. (And if they are through various forms of mysticism, they’re quite likely to be censured if not entirely condemned by the institutional aspects of those religions, etc.)

In most other world religions, where practice is the emphasis, then one can practice the religion, and if “nothing happens” or the people involved don’t feel any divine presences, they are assured that it is still useful and necessary to honor divine beings in the ways they have been doing (which is to say, the gods still need us, even though they’re superior to us, which can’t be said about the monotheistic deities). But, if “something” does happen, and an individual has a direct experience of one of the divine beings involved, then it’s not odd or aberrant so much as “lucky” perhaps; it can always be integrated into the overall purview of the religion, however, to have such things happening.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"The Gerson “therapy” has received a spike in media attention this month because of its failure to save the life of its famous devotee, Jessica Ainscough (“The Wellness Warrior”), who died of a very rare type of cancer on February 26th at age 30. For several decades, the main promoter of this bizarre nutritional approach to healing has been Charlotte Gerson, daughter of its developer, Max Gerson (1881-1959), a German physician who emigrated to the United States in 1936. I have met Charlotte on at least three occasions at conferences promoting so-called alternative treatments. In 2009, I took detailed notes about her 30-minute lecture at the 37th Annual Convention of the Cancer Control Society, an organization that misinforms the public in its advocacy of what it calls “Nutrition and Non-Toxic Therapies” for preventing and controlling cancer and other diseases. It seems timely now to share some of my notes and discuss what they reveal about how some people can be seduced into choosing a treatment protocol as preposterous and demanding as Gerson’s.

But first some background….

The Wellness Warrior Jessica Ainscough’s cancer battle has been the subject of thousands of articles. She skillfully publicized her efforts to fight her disease by relying on what she called “natural alternative cancer treatments.” Her tragic story began in 2008 when she developed lumps on her left hand and arm. She was diagnosed with epithelioid carcinoma, a slow-growing but deadly cancer for which the chances of ten-year survival are much improved with proper treatment.

From www.jessicaainscough.com

Her doctors in Sydney, Australia initially advised her that her arm would need to be amputated at her shoulder, but they came up with an option to spare her arm that she accepted: They infused her arm with very high-dose chemotherapy with her arm isolated from the rest of her blood circulation to protect the rest of her body. Although the treatment put her cancer in remission, by 2009 the cancer had recurred. Her doctors then recommended the extreme amputation they initially proposed. Faced with such a severe treatment, a reasonable person would want to find a viable non-mutilating alternative. Although there was no such alternative for Jess to find, she thought she found an answer. She wrote in Dolly, the magazine she had worked for as online editor:

I began looking at the different ways I may have contributed to the manifestation of my disease and then stopped doing them.

You may wonder: Why the strange phrasing: “manifestation of my disease”? But promoters of supposedly holistic treatments commonly talk that way. In a previous piece for Swift, I called it the cancer-is-the-symptom ploy and gave several examples of the rhetoric used including this unwarranted presumption asserted as fact: “People don’t get sick because they have cancer. They’re already sick and they develop cancer.” At the Cancer Control Society’s 2009 convention, Charlotte Gerson told her audience that you cannot heal selectively. “Cancer is not a one disease,” she said. “If you truly heal, everything heals.” Another unwarranted presumption is that very rare cancers are attributable to lifestyle. Jess continued:

I swapped a lifestyle of late nights, cocktails and Lean Cuisines for carrot juice, coffee enemas and meditation and became an active participant in my treatment.

As I explained in that previous Swift piece, the use of a supposedly non-toxic multicomponent approach for restoring health “is appealing to some patients for several reasons, such as it: (1) provides a means for them to take control of their health; (2) gives an impression that they are doing all that can be done to enhance spirit, mind, and body; and (3) assures them that their “cures” are not worse than their diseases.”

This research led me to Gerson Therapy which ensures you have a perfectly balanced diet for optimum health, assisting your body to flush out nasties whilst feeding it with all the goodness it needs to flourish. The therapy involves drinking 13 fresh organic veggie juices per day (yes that’s one an hour, every hour of my waking day), five coffee enemas per day and a basic organic whole food plant-based diet with additional supplements. For two years I devoted my entire life to healing, to the extent that I was effectively housebound.

Charlotte Gerson at the 2009 Cancer Control Society Convention The convention was held at its regular Labor Day Weekend location, the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Universal City, California. It’s an annual event that attracts several hundred promoters, practitioners, and enthusiasts of using so-called alternative medicine against chronic diseases and for wellness. Some of the people at the convention were patients and customers of hucksters at the convention. Others were shopping for ways to heal their own diseases or for cures for their afflicted loved ones. There was very little sense to be found in the various talks, videos, and exhibits. In the two out of three days I attended, I encountered no discussions of rigorously designed clinical research indicating that any of the treatments discussed had significant therapeutic value. Charlotte Gerson was an audience favorite with her folksy, easy-to-follow, evidence-free talk on “Healing Cancer & Other Chronic Diseases.” She offered her simplistic, nonsensical preaching with certitude and combined it with “orthodox medicine” bashing. Her speaker biography provided by the Cancer Control Society read:

…She was born and had her early schooling in Germany. She left in 1933 and continued school in Austria, France, and England, then attended Smith college after coming to New York. She helped translate her father’s books and writings into English. She sometimes managed Dr. Gerson’s clinics, attended his lectures, supervised nursing and joined him in making rounds and in discussing cases. As Founder of the Gerson Institute, she lectures widely and currently teaches physicians who operate the Gerson Therapy Hospital. She also trains other physicians and caregivers in the application of this Nutritional Therapy. Dr. Max Gerson is famous for his revolutionary healing therapy for cancer and other diseases presented in his book A Cancer Therapy—Results of 50 Cases. Dr. Albert Schweitzer called Dr. Gerson one of medicine’s most eminent geniuses. Charlotte has co-authored a book with Beata Bishop, called Healing the Gerson Way, which updates Dr. Gerson’s famous book…. She has also authored individual booklets on some of the most frequent cancers. Lately, a film is available on the Therapy, The Gerson Miracle, which won first prize in the Beverly Hills Film Festival in May, 2004. The DVD shows the Gerson Therapy as well as a number of cured “incurables.” Two more documentaries followed: Dying to Have Known and The Beautiful Truth with more cured “incurables” and doctors and professors successfully using the Gerson Therapy.

She began her talk by bragging about being 87 years old and having no osteoporosis (as if that’s extraordinary and a reason to do what she preaches). She emphasized that she doesn’t eat meat or dairy. The only way to get acid, she suggested, was by eating animal protein. She asked: “Where do big animals get protein?” Her answer was grass (as if that’s applicable to humans and that no big animals are carnivorous). “Carl Lewis was a vegan,” she said. She explained that he was so strong because his diet gave him alkalinity. I don’t think she knew that “Usain Bolt Ate 100 Chicken McNuggets a Day in Beijing and Somehow Won Three Gold Medals.” (I am not endorsing McNuggets.) She claimed that when the pH goes below 6, the result is cancer. She insisted on the need to keep the body alkaline because it “cannot function with acid” and that when you eat so much animal protein, the pancreas is so busy it can’t protect you. “Keep pH above 7 with vegetarian protein,” she advised. I’m sure that sounded sensible to her audience. Oy gevalt! The pH scale is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a watery solution (e.g., blood). At normal body temperatures, a pH less than 6.8 is acidic and greater than 6.8 is alkaline. (Introductory chemistry students learn that 7 is the neutrality cut point between acidic and alkaline, but, as explained in Benjamin Abelow’s textbook Understanding Acid-Base, that’s correct only at a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.) Normal arterial blood has a pH of 7.4, so a normal bloodstream is indeed alkaline and your bodily processes keep it very close to 7.4. Otherwise you are in no position to listen to a lecture. Arterial blood is severely acidic when the pH falls below 7.1. You cannot have a blood pH that gets below or close to 6 and still be alive. She went on to promote “living natural minerals” and juices. Minerals are, by definition, naturally occurring; there are no unnatural minerals. If you’re seeking living minerals, see the horta in a popular episode of Star Trek. “Cancer is impossible if defenses are working,” she claimed. She referred to cancer as a “foreign protein.” This is a premise of the dubious treatment plan proposed by William Donald Kelley, D.D.S., which is currently promoted in combination with Gerson-style treatment by Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez. People know pharmaceutical treatments don’t work, she said. She claimed that 20% of doctors wouldn’t take chemo and that they give it to you because they’re paid massive sums by pharmaceutical companies. On the Anaximperator blog,beatis provided citations for relevant published poll dataand found ample evidence refuting Charlotte’s claim. Gerson therapy is not only a cancer therapy, she said. She claimed it also treats heart disease, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, diabetes, and cystic fibrosis. (Beware of promoters of panaceas.) She referred to a case of retinitis pigmentosa. She said the patient used a lot of salt and that “salt is 20 times worse than sugar.” She said she told the patient to stop eating salt and eat carrot juice. She claimed that with a “partial therapy” her vision became clear, her color vision came back, her peripheral vision came back, and the patient could now tell black from navy blue pants. (I’m not aware of any published case report about this patient.) Charlotte claimed she can control diabetes in 2-3 weeks and that it has nothing to do with sugar. It has to do with receptors blocked by cholesterol. She described cheese as “deadly.” The three things she said that are needed to produce cancer are fat, salt, and animal protein. As Christopher Hitchens famously noted, “…what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.” Charlotte’s audience wanted to believe in the hope she offered and accepted her certitude as sufficient evidence. As a true believer in her battle for wellness, Jess Ainscough also attracted a devoted audience. Mark Twain overlooked the persuasive abilities of women when he wrote: “The most outrageous lies that can be invented will find believers if a man only tells them with all his might.Charlotte concluded her talk by saying that she’s not ill and has no pain. She received a standing ovation.

In the book, Gulliver encounters among other things a floating island inhabited by spaced-out scientists and philosophers who hardly deal with reality. Swift was among the first to launch well-designed critiques against the flummery - political, philosophical, and scientific - of his time, a tradition that we hope to maintain at The James Randi Foundation.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

ERIC HOLDER, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I don't know, whatever quantum of
proof, however you want to describe it, to believe that a person posed
a danger to the United States, we will do all that we can to ensure
that that person remains detained and does not become a danger to the
American people.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

STEPHANOPOULOS: And is that enough assurance for you, Senator
Kyl?

KYL: Well, understand that we've already released those who,
after careful examination, we thought didn't pose a danger. And the
number is somewhere between 30 and 60 who turned out to continue to
conduct their activities against us after they were released.

The remaining 240 or so do pose a danger. So there aren't any
left that can easily be released because they don't pose a danger.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, that's not exactly true, right? And I
want to bring Senator Webb in on this, because I know there are about
17, I believe, Chinese Uighurs, they are called, who have been ordered
released by a federal court, they've determined not to be a threat to
the United States.

And the administration has been working on plans to bring them to
Virginia. Can you accept them in your state?

WEBB: Well, let me back up for a minute. The answer is no.

STEPHANOPOULOS: No?

WEBB: No. And I'll -- and then let me explain why. But to back
it up, the numbers that we've seen in my office are about 800 people
have gone through Guantanamo.

The majority of those who have been released, we're down to 220
to 240, so the majority of those that have been released have been
released to third countries, not actually released out into the open
-- you know, to where they can...
STEPHANOPOULOS: Just let out the door, right.

WEBB: Yes, right. So we don't know really where they have gone.
This other group deserves due process. They deserve, in the right
kind of environment, and I support what the president is doing on the
military commissions, to have their cases examined, to see whether or
not they should continue to be detained.

The situation with the Chinese Uighurs that you're talking about,
on the one hand, it can be argued that they were simply conducting
dissident activities against the government of China.

On the other, they accepted training from al Qaeda and as a
result they have taken part in terrorism. I don't believe they should
come to the United States.

STEPHANOPOULOS: Not to the United States and not Virginia.

WEBB: No, I don't believe so.

KYL: No, I totally agree.

STEPHANOPOULOS: How about this, there is also the group that
might have to be brought to the United States for trial or to be
detained here. And the Republicans in the Senate have put out
legislation -- not introduced legislation that says no detainee should
be brought to the United States in any way unless the state
legislature and the governor of the state passes -- signs off on that.

One, do you have the votes to pass it? And, two, will you block
any funding for the closing of Guantanamo without those assurances?

KYL: That was a motion by House Republicans. We're taking up
the bill next week. There will be an amendment that would preclude --
it would similar to that, but perhaps not identical.

A similar resolution passed a couple of years ago 93-4 saying,
don't bring these detainees to the United States. And my guess is
that none of this supplemental funding will be allowed to relocate
detainees into the United States, that that amendment will be adopted.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Did you know that you can substitute Jack Daniels Whiskey for Vanilla? I’m a big Jack Daniels fan. Besides ‘on the rocks’ it can do wonders to add unique flavor to many recipes.

We recently had the opportunity to tour the Jack Daniels Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee. If you get the chance, GO!!! The Basic Tour is FREE and if you are over 21 you can sign up for the Sampling Tour for a mere $12.00 per person. When you go, don’t skip the town of Lynchburg. Park and walk around. It’s small enough to walk the whole square and stop in one of the restaurants for a nice lunch. You won’t leave without stopping at one of the several unique culinary/candy shops where you can get your specialty chocolates incorporated with Ole’ Jack! Mmmmm.

There are several different varieties of this amazing whiskey as well as multiple uses besides the old-fashioned ‘medicinal’ one on the rocks. Jack Daniels Single Barrel is a perfect one for one substitute for Vanilla in your baking and cooking. It has deep rich color and flavor. I don’t ALWAYS have Single Barrel on hand as it is a bit expensive. BUT Jack Daniels Old No. 7 will work too. If you are looking for sweetness, then the Tennessee Honey Whiskey would be a good choice. Jack Daniels Fireball will add a boost of hot cinnamon to your recipes.

When grocery shopping, take note of the items boasting Jack Daniels in its ingredients. It isn’t a well-kept secret, but one that is often overlooked. From Barbecues to Cakes and Cookies and Candy. You just can’t beat a good shot of Jack Daniels to add flavor and excitement to your culinary crafts.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"When Luke, our hallowed leader of Custard based television messaged me way back in January asking if I'd be able to travel to Manchester shortly and do something for the website I tentatively replied with a lame ""not sure, it's quite short notice and far away"". When he came back with the words ""No Offence Series 3 press day"" I literally peppered my private bits with breath spray and in a menacing Viv tone uttered ""I'll sort it. Count me in sugar tits.""

For those not familiar with Paul Abbott's crime drama, I suggest quickly catching up on All4 but how to sum it up up a paragraph? It's a fast-paced, dramatic, funny, inappropriate, sweary crime drama led by the magnificent Detective Inspector Viv Deering. A woman who would happily waltz into Gene Hunt's kingdom and play Queen of the jungle. Written by the celebrated Paul Abbott (Shameless, Clocking Off) the dialogue is an electric mix of dark humour, unique insults and even, would you believe, some stuff about policing. In amongst all the madness, there is no desire to shy away from serious subject matters either. The first series focused on the murders of women with Down's Syndrome and the second had nods towards child trafficking. For the forthcoming series the show is not only about to get political but very current as it focuses on a far-right group.

Unluckily for me, my visit to the set coincides with the arrival of 'The Beast from the East' It was ruddy cold!. So, on an overcast winter's day in a far-flung corner of Rochdale at a temporary unit base might not be the most glamorous location but its a perfectly apt one because it felt so very No Offence. Luckily, most of the main cast are in attendance today and the first arrival is the marvellous Elaine Cassidy who plays DC Dinah Kowalska.

This morning Elaine is dressed in a flowery dress which we're assured is not a major tonal shift in her character's development and is indeed her own garb. Thank goodness for that, we don't want Dinah to be summery and cheerful! She is someone who on screen cuts an intense figure, always dressed in black and deeply ambitious about the job she loves. In the fifteen episodes so far she has certainly got herself into a few scrapes but her good heart is always what puts her there.

In keeping with previous series openers, the third instalment begins with big shocks. Run over by the bus? Bomb explosion in a crematorium? That's nothing compared what's in store this time round. ""It's a personal journey for everybody in Friday Street, as always the job means so much to all of them. They always want to get a result"" Elaine explains ""Dennis Caddy (???) is the head of a far-right group called Albion and they know he's involved at the beginning of the series. It's about trying to take down Albion but in doing that they find out it's not as straightforward as they initially thought. No case ever is. There are other people who are in the limelight in Manchester, who have influential jobs and it starts to get quite.. incestuous as to who is in whose pockets. There's a politician (played by Lisa Mcgrillis) who, when I was reading it I found quite an attractive character because she's really ambitious and she's come from nowt and its through her hard work and her tenacity that she wants to climb the ladder. She wants to get to the top and that is to become the Mayor of Manchester"".

What does series three offer for Dinah? ""Dinah's personal journey has comparisons to series one. This case is kind of similar to year one because there is a personal connection to wanting to get a result, not just caring about the job and being married to it. There's more at stake, there's an emotional drive to what keeps her going. You really see Friday Street pull together as a team as they always do. They get tighter when things get tougher"".

No Offence as a show hits fast and moves faster, the storylines operate with a blink and you miss it policy. The new run offers new blood for fans to fall for. ""There are a few new characters who I think will be really entertaining for the audience and that's fun from Dinah's point of view, to see whether she likes them. Dinah hates the establishment which is an oxymoron. Viv's probably the only boss she'll accept so she's really protective of Viv. It'll take her longer to thaw out because there's a new DCI that comes in"" (Marilyn Merchant played by Claire Rushbrook).

Is Dinah still getting herself into terrible situations and thriving on impulse like she used to? ""I don't think she's got it that wrong this year, like in year two with Norah Attah where the whole thing was recorded and.."" Elaine pulls a concerned face, ""..the chasing someone under a bus! There's not really been the time for her to cock up as the stakes are too high"".

Elaine won't just find her name in the credits once this time around because she's also an associate producer for this third series. ""If I have a question about a scene or a suggestion for little changes if I think that it's right for Dinah because a writer won't know her as well as I do. For instance, she never calls Viv ma'am which she should do but she never did that in year one so whenever they write in ""ma'am"" I always just cross it out and go ""LOOK!"" Viv is like the mum but they're also best friends but there's also the respect that she is the boss. Ma'am could be anyone so she saves that for DCI Merchant who she doesn't like! Then there's Nigel Lindsay (Victoria, Safe) who plays Terry Taylor but everyone calls him Terry-dactyl and Dinah doesn't like him. There are loads of people she doesn't like! I think she doesn't like new people either. She's protective of Viv.""

Does the dynamic change at all between Dinah and her boss? ""They've always been close so there's no animosity. They always know when to challenge each other but a lot of the time they're on the same wavelength. When it comes policing they do go off the book whereas Joy (Alexandra Roach) always does it by the book so they are more maverick in that way.""

This afternoon Elaine is shooting a scene in Rochdale town hall but is it easy to adjust from her natural lilting Irish tones to Mancunian? ""If I'm doing a full day filming I always try to get a little bit of a sleep in because that's always the first thing to go, its sort of like exercise as you're using your mouth in a completely different way so it's like doing a yoga with my mouth. By the end of the day you start slurring your words"". Elaine leaves to change into clothes more fitting with the season and perfect her northern brogue for her afternoon of filming. Gone will be the bright dress and on will come that famous leather jacket so at least she will be warmer. Did I mention it's cold up north?",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Made my little batch last night, 3.5lbs of clover honey and one 32oz bottle of Cranberry/Grape juice rounded out with some distilled water and used some Lalvin D47 yeast and a little yeast nutrient for my 1 gallon batch. This morning it seems to be bubbling.

I've never done any form of wine before, only beer. How long does fermentation typically take? From what I gather wine typically ferments quickly and then you just stabilize it and let it age, correct?

Prickly pears would fit that description and they have the cool reddish purple color.

I was looking to do a Blood wine and a Romulan Ale here in the near future. If you don't mind, could you shoot me over the recipie that you used and do you have any suggestions as to how the Romulan Ale? From what I can gather from the tv shows and movies its more like a wine than anything else, so I figured I might try it as a mead since they generally more abv than a normal wine.

Mixed up the honey and juice well, topped off with distilled water then pitched the yeast. At 60 days I racked into secondary and tasted, already quite drinkable. Tastes like a very potent blush wine. Day 94 I added Sorbate and Metabisulfite, day 95 I back-sweetened with about 4 tablespoons of honey. Day 96 I bottled.

Totally just a recipe I made up in my head and it seemed to have worked quite well. Not sure if it will be any kind of prize winner but it certainly is drinkable and potent.

I think it totally works as bloodwine, the cranberry gives it a little bite that I think Klingon beverages should have. The next batch I do I might throw in a few fresh cranberries as well to up the ante.

As for Romulan Ale I've given it some thought and I think I've come up with an idea. Ok, they call it ""ale"" but it's blue. I've tried making blue beer before but because beer comes out yellow or brown it's impossible with food coloring so I think a white mead is the way to go. Also we know that it's supposed to be very strong (for an ale) which an 11-13% ABV mead would certainly be. This will be my recipe when I try it:

I would let it ferment for about 30 days, rack to secondary then around day 90 I'd bottle it on top of 1/2tsp of superfine bar sugar (per bottle). This should cause a tiny bit of fermentation in-bottle and carbonate it.

I know it sounds like a strange recipe but I'm thinking it would result in something like a white wine with blue coloring, a little fizz and a fairly good ABV without being too dry. I would suggest shaking the carbonation out of the Sprite before putting it into your must, also a yeast nutrient might be a good idea. My only fear with the Sprite is the PH, but I think it could work since it's only 1 liter.

Most folks will probably balk at the idea of fermenting Sprite, but hey, you gotta try before you know it won't work. If you're afraid of using Sprite you could always just add a bunch of lemon and lime to the batch in its place.

Hey. I know this is an old thread, but I did something with black cherry juice. I did a 250 mL honey mead starter with EC-1118 and let it percolate for about a day.

"Episode 10 – Torah Wrap-up: It’s Leviticonumeraldeuteronomic!

First of all, give yourself a pat on the back. You are going to listen to a podcast about Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. When this is over, you’ll surely have earned some kind of mindless, indulgent treat, like a deep fried Twinkie or an NBC sitcom. You have my admiration simply for showing up. Kudos, my friend. Here we go, BOOK!

[INTRO MUSIC]

It might seem foolhardy to undertake three whole books in one short podcast, but I think it will work out nicely and free us up to move on quickly to the next chapter in Israel’s history and the Bible’s literary pageant. We’ve already examined Genesis and Exodus in some detail, now here’s how the rest of the Torah breaks down: Leviticus consists of more covenant law, Numbers is the story of the generation that passes before Israel is ready to finally enter the land of Canaan, and Deuteronomy is a sort of theological recap of Exodus. They are all good reads, but more important, they are all foundational for the biblical literature that follows. Remember that, technically, we have only been reading a single book by a single author or group of authors so far. After today, we will move forward and discover new genres and new perspectives on Israel’s history, but the Torah will always be square one. Nothing else can make sense without it.

OK, here we go: Leviticus.

LEVITICUS

The Latin name “Leviticus” refers to the Israelite tribe of Levi, the tribe of Moses and his brother Aaron. The Levite tribe was unlike the other eleven tribes of Israel, as they were set aside or “consecrated” to be priests. Instead of selecting priests from among the various tribes by some standard of personal merit, the only way to become a priest in Israel was to be born into the family of Levi. Leviticus is a repository for laws and instructions that relate specifically to the work of priests: how to make the various types of food sacrifices, laws about “clean” and “unclean” animals and activities, and rituals for people who had become “unclean” by contracting a disease or touching something designated “unclean.”

This is the “cult” of Israel, or the daily religious ritual. It also details the various feasts and holidays which the priests will oversee, including Passover, which we studied in Exodus, and the Day of Atonement, when sacrifices are made on behalf of the entire nation of Israel to “atone” or “wipe away” the guilt of their corporate sin. The laws about acceptable and unacceptable sexual practices are the only bits from Leviticus which get any press these days, and the people preaching or condemning those passages rarely recognize that this is basically a handbook for ancient priests, and shouldn’t be removed that very specific context.

NUMBERS

The scroll we call “Numbers” is one of those long and tricky texts which at first appears to be an endless list of genealogies and names, but actually plays an important narrative and thematic role in the Torah. A quick summary of the structure of Numbers: First, a census of the people, including a breakdown of each tribe and some more details about the priests; then Israel’s departure from Mount Sinai and their adventures on the way to Canaan, including rebellions, battles, and a run-in with a pagan prophet named Balaam; then another census, and some more laws and instructions for the priests. On the surface it seems like a grab-bag of lists and little narrative pieces, but once we discover the literary structure, its purpose in the overall structure of the Torah becomes more clear.

Numbers is all about transition, the discontinuity of the people who will enter the land, but the continuity of the covenant and the leadership. It’s like this: the keys to the structure are the census at the beginning, and the census toward the end. An entire generation passes between them, so that (almost) none who were living at the time of the lawgiving at Mount Sinai are still alive when the group reaches Canaan. God states plainly in Numbers chapter 14 that this will be the case, a punishment for the peoples’ grumbling and rebellion.

However, by breaking the people down into tribes as part of that first census (in Numbers chapter 1), and organizing them by the names of Jacob’s twelve sons (Judah, Simeon, Levi, etc.), the tribal identities will survive and in that way the people will be the “same” when they enter the land. The scroll of Numbers moves the story along, but more importantly does so with all of the covenant trappings in place. Israel’s identity is now big enough and strong enough to live on beyond that first particular group of people who fled from Egypt. Israel is now an idea, ready to plant itself in the ground and become a nation. That’s the scroll of Numbers.

DEUTERONOMY

“Deuteronomy,” or devarim in Hebrew, is the last of the five sections of Torah. It starts and ends with narrative bits, but the bulk of the book consists of laws and admonitions to the people of Israel, presumably from the priests. There is a lot of new material, but also much that is recycled and expanded from earlier in the Torah: the Ten Commandments are repeated in a slightly different configuration, the feasts and holidays are revisited, and some of the laws from Exodus and Leviticus are restated. However, it is hard to ignore the very different tone and presentation of the laws in Deuteronomy. While the legal bits in the previous books were written down as literature, the material in Deuteronomy appears to have been designed to be read out loud. A repeated refrain throughout the book is “Hear, O Israel…” followed by some instruction, blessing, or warning.

And speaking of blessing and warning, this is perhaps the main innovation of Deuteronomy. While the laws of Exodus and Leviticus are presented as statements of identity, as simple boundary markers, Deuteronomy introduces the idea of reward for obedience to the law, and punishment for breaking the law. Not rewards or punishments doled out by the priests (though these do come up from time to time), but rather blessings and curses poured out on the people by God himself. If you obey the law, life in the land will go well, you will be victorious in battle and your crops will be healthy. If you disobey and follow another path, things will be rough for you. Your enemies will defeat you, and perhaps even – worst case scenario – carry you off into exile (file that one away for later). Note, however, that we’re still talking about very earthbound blessings and curses. This is not heaven versus hell, it’s success versus failure in this life, in this land, here and now.

Deuteronomy makes more sense if we think about the social-religious reality of Israel at this stage in its development. The first generation, the generation that left Egypt and received the law first-hand from Moses at Mt. Sinai, is gone. They’re dead. The new generation has inherited the covenant and the mission to settle the land. They didn’t experience the Red Sea or Sinai for themselves, so like any generation which inherits religion from the old folks, it needs to be retold, re-explained, expanded and supported, or it’s just not going to stick. The often passionate, sermon-like tone of the teachings in Deuteronomy – combined with the “read-aloud” format – reflects this dynamic.

One more thing about the text of Deuteronomy, and this takes us in a very different direction and a new kind of conversation here on BOOK. There is a formidable scholarly hypothesis that suggests portions of Deuteronomy were written later in Israel’s history – much later – and edited back into the scroll. Specifically, the business about blessings and curses and exile all sounds very much like theology that would have developed a thousand or so years later when Israel actually found itself threatened with imminent exile. The second book of Kings describes how King Josiah – one of the last kings of Israel before the great exile that altered their national destiny forever – discovered the long-lost “scroll of the law,” presumably Deuteronomy, and how the Israelites rejoiced and read it out loud. The redaction theory suggests that at this point the scroll was edited and updated to reflect Israel’s contemporary situation.

On the one hand, I’m always rather cautious and skeptical when it comes to hypothetical Bible redactions. Scholars have had a field day, explaining that every passage that strikes them as odd must have just been added by someone “after the fact.” These theories are fascinating, but they are ALWAYS just theories, and many times they reflect a willful ignorance of the way the literature was originally designed to work. HOWEVER, religious readers who shudder and balk at the idea of biblical redaction in general need to calm down and understand how ancient authorship worked. It is not at all unthinkable that any Bible text might have been edited, updated, or otherwise redacted – even heavily so. This is how ancient texts were developed and put together. Authorship and ownership of literature did not work then as it does now. Communities forged texts, often through oral transmission and “contemporization” to their own time and place.

We’ve already suggested that the Torah was compiled out of existing material by Israel’s priests upon the settlement of the land. That makes the whole thing a work of editing and redaction, so there’s really no reason that a later redaction would be a big problem. I’m not completely convinced by the Josian redaction theory about Deuteronomy, but I don’t see it as a problem or threat. It’s just an historically reasonable theory, and I wanted to at least introduce the notion of redaction into our study.

Deuteronomy ends with Moses pronouncing a blessing on Israel, and then breathing his last. Before he dies, Moses passes the banner of leadership over to his right-hand-man Joshua who, along with his partner Caleb, are the only two witnesses of Mount Sinai who will enter into the land. That narrative is picked up after the Torah by the book bearing Joshua’s name. We’ll look at that controversial text next time.

But that’s a wrap on our examination of the Torah. Take a deep breath. We covered a lot of material in ten short podcasts, picked apart some very complex and very old pieces of writing, and tried to wrap our brains around some very big, very foreign ideas. There is a LOT of Bible left, but the events, themes, and literary tropes of the Torah are now the currency and medium with which the later Bible authors will weave their stories. Creation and covenant, blessings and curses, offspring and land. These are the keys to connecting the biblical dots.

That’s gonna do it for today. Next time we’ll look at the first two books of the Bible after the Torah: Joshua and Judges. Very different books that are stages in the same argument. They set up a problem which is solved in the following books, Ruth and Samuel. But before any of that, I think we’ll do a fun supplement with a few “deleted scenes” from Genesis and Exodus, some juicy bits we had to leave out for time. Look for that soon.

Is it time to peg the Australian dollar?

The Reserve Bank's moves are only increasing policy uncertainty and diminishing consumer confidence, but there might be a solution.

The Reserve Bank of Australia has lost control of monetary policy. This is a simple fact borne out by the RBA’s decision earlier this week to cut rates in response to similar moves by central banks elsewhere.

Policymakers still think that the currency is too strong; that was the primary reason cited by the RBA for this latest cut.

In following this path, however, policymakers have actually destroyed confidence and put the economy on a weaker footing than it would otherwise be on. This easing cycle is three years old and rates were already at generational lows.

Have a think about why non-mining business investment is still so weak, why consumer spending is supposedly so fragile. There are no structural impediments, just a lack of confidence.

Unfortunately, each and every time the RBA cuts, confidence seems to get weaker as households and business begin to reassess the outlook.

It’s with that in mind that the exchange rate target being pursued could be formalised, perhaps by establishing a currency board. Under this arrangement, rather than having a fixed interest rate target at any given point (currently 2.25 per cent), the AUD-USD exchange rate would be fixed at a particular level (or the trade-weighted index). Interest rates would then simply move up or down automatically in order to reach that target.

Currency boards are widely regarded as being better suited to small open economies such as Australia that have difficulty sustaining an independent monetary policy. Under the circumstances, it would be naive to suggest that the RBA conducts an independent monetary policy.

With a fixed exchange rate, and in this world of competitive devaluations, interest rate fluctuations would then be largely unrelated to perceived economic conditions. The nexus between rate moves and weaker confidence would be broken.

The main advantage to this approach, however, is that it would clarify to the nation (and to the market and everyone else) what the true policy target is. As things stand, the country is beholden to a seemingly arbitrary and unknown policy goal. A month or two ago, the market was toying with a couple of rate hikes here or there. Subsequent data justified those positions. All of a sudden (and with no change to the economic backdrop), we’re facing a few more rate cuts. Households and business can be forgiven for feeling a little queasy about such an abrupt change.

So the government should stop the façade and just fix the exchange rate. We effectively have an exchange rate target anyway; it’s just that no one outside of the bureaucracy seems to know what it is. Maybe they don’t know themselves -- certainly the goalposts seem to move.

Back in 2012 under the previous Labor government, the target was put at US85c, a level swiftly described by the RBA as desirable. Then the target moved to US75c, a level subsequently adopted by the Coalition. Now that we’re nearly at that point, the focus has moved onto the trade-weighted index. A currency board would prevent this kind of chaos. It would introduce discipline (to both the government and the bureaucracy) and policy certainty in an uncertain world, a world gripped by competitive devaluations and the currency war.

It must be emphasised that this is only a second-best solution. Ideally we would live in a world with freely floating exchange rates. This is certainly preferable, and it’s clear that inflation targeting has served the country well.

But the reality is we don’t live in that world anymore. Inflation targeting has been dispensed with globally and currency manipulation is rife. The exchange rate is the target; the monetary system needs to change as a result.

Regardless of whether you view the RBA’s latest move as a positive step or not, one thing remains clear: it caught analysts and commentators completely off guard. Late last year, every economist was forecasting the next move would be up. There is a reason for that: global and domestic economies had been (and still are) getting better. It made sense to expect that the RBA would act to reduce the degree of monetary stimulus.

The problem is this unshakeable view in policy circles that the commodity price slump will lead to a disastrous fall in national income and jobs. That is, unless the exchange rate falls as well. This is crux of the current problem. Unfortunately, this simply forces the RBA to respond to whatever central banks elsewhere are doing. Consequently, there is no consistency in policy. Under this current ad-hoc approach, Australia’s institutions risk their credibility, financial stability, currency stability and inflation -- even if just asset price inflation. Changes clearly need to be made.

"Of manifestos and manias

To say that the market is happy with the Congress victory would be an understatement. But would investors have been as happy had they brushed up on the Congress manifesto?

Parties rarely live up to their campaign promises, but it’s worth taking this manifesto at face value. The Congress has been touting its populist measures—the rural jobs scheme and the farm loan waiver—during the entire campaign.

This populism is abundant in the manifesto. The party promises 25kg of grain a month to families below the poverty line, a measure that will increase food subsidies, already at Rs30,000 crore annually. It also promises to expand last year’s Rs65,000 crore loan waiver to reach more farmers, while shirking off disinvestment for public sector enterprises in manufacturing. This can’t help the fiscal deficit.

The Congress has a genuine chance to pursue reform. But its populism is at odds with the reform agenda the market thinks imminent. The mania appears to have blinded investors to this tension.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

The Radzewicz Riddle–The Rise and Fall of Nations

Posted on December 15, 2008

The 17th century English pamphleteer Cato ranked among the great enemies of Kings and champions of the common people. Like Algernon Sidney, John Trenchard, Thomas Paine, Sam Adams, and John Dickinson, he advocated an end to the Divine Right of Kings, and a beginning for the Rights of Men. They were the talk radio of their respective eras and helped fashion the 17th century Glorious Revolution in England and the even more glorious Revolution in America in the following century.

It is impressive to consider the lengthy time periods that were required to throw off the shackles of aristocratic authority from the shoulders of the common people. The Magna Carta had been signed by King John in 1215, six to seven hundred years before these more final revolutions occurred in England and the American colonies. The ordinary citizens had been striving for that long to make headway. And even the Glorious Revolution of the 1680’s didn’t grant enough rights to dissuade millions of Englishmen from leaving their homes and going to the New World.

It is even more humbling to recognize that that slow centuries long process of gaining freedom for a majority of English speaking citizens was the best there ever had been–anywhere on earth. England’s democritization was painfully slow, but at least it happened–and led to America’s full blown freedoms. Aside from a few other European nations, there was no movement to free individuals anywhere else on the Globe!

Now there had been antecedents in a few isolated outposts where there was no aristocracy or autocrats to tyrannize the people. Phoenicia, Greece, Rome, Venice, Holland, Iceland, and the Hanseatic cities had flourished while they remained free and open societies, but that’s only about a fraction of 1% of the world’s population! However, if you look at each of those rare free societies, even though they all Rose for a while to great affluence, sooner or later they all matured, withered, and Declined to obscurity.

The Riddle of History is Why, when these nations were small and isolated, with limited resources, poor school systems, struggling to grow food and manufacture tools and equipment, they somehow did all that, gained prosperity, and yet later, with better schools, a growing elite intellectual class, and expanded governmental systems in place, they commenced a Decline? Did adversity make the people work harder at first? What happened to end the upward progress of these successful enclaves?

And why was the existence of free societies restricted to this tiny handful of the world’s people? What was unique to those few “laboratories of history” that showed the way to personal liberty and affluence. The Radzewicz Rule suggests that it was economic freedom and an empowering Faith that allowed the common genius of a citizenry to flourish. But those conditions were extremely rare throughout history for all people. If you had been born somewhere at random on earth during the period from 3,000 BC to 1,775 AD, your odds or chance of gaining personal freedom would be akin to winning the Massachusetts mega jackpot! That is why the pamphleteers for liberty were so praiseworthy–where they were allowed to speak and write they demanded freedom.

Those scribblers, sneered at by the great Philosophers, wrote simply. They laid out the case for liberty in brief essays that were widely read by common people.. There was no need for academics to explain what they wrote. They knew of the actual cases in history where people had gained freedom and they called for more of the same.

Cato wrote, “The People, when they are not misled or corrupted, generally make a sound Judgment of Things. They have natural Qualifications equal to those of their Superiors; and there is oftener found a great Genius carrying a Pitchfork, than carrying a White Staff.”

In those two sentences, Cato attests to the fact that common people are often wiser than their intellectual and over-educated betters. However, Cato went on to make a key point about the Rise and Fall of Nations; he echoed the Radzewicz Rule axiom that successful societies were created by common folk only when they were free and unburdened by intellectuals.

Cato wrote: “Besides, there are not such mighty Talents requisite for Government, as some, who pretend to them without possessing them, would make us believe; Honest affections, and common Qualifications are sufficient; and the Administration has always been best executed, and the Publick Liberty best preserved, near the Origin and Rise of States, when plain Honesty and common Sense alone governed the public Affairs and the Morals of Men.”

There, in Cato’s fine words, is the answer to the Riddle– Young, vibrant societies are not burdened by non-productive elites that advise and consult but do no real work. They are unregulated, unrestricted, and the citizenry are forced to innovate and free to produce. Only after those ordinary people have created abundance can their society have the where-withall to support parasitic classes–mostly academics, utopianists, government employees, foundation employees and special interest groups.

All those new elites that emerge in successful nations are parasites–they were not present in the building–but now they have to carve out a comfortable niche for themselves. Since they are by definition non-productive, their only role can be found in directing the efforts of the remaining productive citizenry. Since they bring an inexperienced vision to the task, tainted with utopian abstractions, the resulting direction will always be counter-productive. This process continues and escalates over time. One mistaken policy requires another worse policy to correct the results of the last failure –and Decline sets in.

The amswer to the Riddle is counter-intuitive. But only if you have an undue respect for the intellectual elites that presume to control the nation from lofty non-productive perches on high. Remember that it was the Honest Affections of the common people at the beginning that made for Efficiency and the maintenance of Publick Liberty. And, sadly, it is the complex ideologies of the new elites that undermine the sturdy foundation built by those honest and simple people.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"It’s Going To Get Worse Before It Gets Better And It Ain’t Bad Yet

Had a discussion with a liberal Texan who has not, in her adult years, experienced economic difficulty. That is, unlike me, she has not lived in an economically dying state (New York in the mid-90’s, Michigan in the late 90’s early 00’s) and finally, an economically dead state (NY and MI now). So, a few people at her place of employment have been laid off and she’s worried. She was supremely offended when I said, “It’s not bad yet and it’s going to get worse.”

Just as a citizen in Michigan and New York has a hard time fathoming how thoroughly boiled a frog he is, a Texan or Floridian has a difficult time fathoming how good he has it.

A Southern liberal also has a tough time comprehending the destruction the union mentality and heavy taxation brings to a state. Unions destroy productivity and detach performance from pay. This, ironically, interferes with individualism. As in, the individual defers to the whole and becomes less inclined to be the best he can be. His spirit is destroyed. So much so, that in absence of unions, many men (mostly men) sit and wait for salvation. They are used to the strength coming from without, not from within.

Heavy taxation does it’s own sort of damage. Businesses, bodies of people together, reach a point where the work load isn’t worth it. The companies either move or fold.

Texas has grown because states like Michigan and New York kill their business climate. And yet, a Texas liberal refused to hear the truth about taxes and unions while simultaneously lamenting lay-offs at her company. This kind of disconnect is disturbing, but revealing.

What liberals want is a guarantee. She wants no one to ever lose a job. She wants no one to ever to know economic discomfort. She wants the country to have Texas’ economy but tax and unionize like New York and Michigan. You can’t have it both ways. It won’t work, as California is now learning. The safety net, large and cushy, is its own sort of noose. Eventually it kills the golden goose. The goose dies or flies South.

The worrying thing is that if the whole nation operates like Michigan, New York and California, the economy everywhere will die. At a certain point, government money runs out. That can’t just keep printing it forever.

It’s a terrible thing when liberals get their way. The policies do the exact opposite of their intention. It’s not bad here in Texas. In fact, it’s still pretty good. Liberal policies won’t prevent disaster here. They cause them. I’m afraid not enough people know that.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Bliss Stage: Actual Play

Bliss Stage is actually harder to prep as a one-shot than as a campaign. This is mostly because the game relies on players to generate the soap opera drama through play, which builds as you do multiple sessions.

So, if you want to do a “campaign ending” one-shot, you have to write up little relationship outlines for everyone to give them something to kick off with.

The second thing, is that Bliss Stage works very different than a lot of RPGs- most rpgs you can grab a character sheet and the stats tell you about your character and what you’re good at doing- Bliss Stage is all about relationships which are ever-shifting. So there’s a bit of orientation you need to give players to help them understand who the characters are and what they can do.

I included some description in the quicksheets and a bit on the character sheets to help folks make that transition.

So, confession #1 – this is the first time I ran Bliss Stage, ever.

Of the 6 players, Jono and Sushu I regularly game with, so we had a good comfort level there. The other 4 players all had at least some familiarity with anime and I think 2 had briefly looked at the Bliss Stage rules and such, had some idea about the premise.

A quick read of the character sheets is useful for seeing who the characters are and the drama between them. What’s interesting is we had a father & son playing Selene & Ken, and a wife & husband playing Mark & Lisa.

Mission 1- Fraying Edges

Mark and Tamara are sent to scout and serve as a distraction while Selene escorts the Disruptor as it’s being transported along on the barely running train system.

One thing I found interesting is that the Anchor players had no problem coming up with conflicts or problems to the missions before I had to even do much. In fact, I found myself having to adjust as a GM to meet the conflicts they’d introduce. Obviously, for more than a one-shot, the group would get good at picking up a collective aesthetic, but for the one-shot, it was a neat stretch for me.

Mark and Tamara did fine on their missions- it was Selene who got the crazy Nightmare from rolls, etc. Mark then came back to rescue her.

All of that was pretty tame stuff – the interlude scenes after are where things really kicked off. The joke was, “The Real World: Evangelion” as the drama began to kick in. The mission only served to provide fuel for the dramas between characters…

Tamara confronted Stacy in the mess hall, and loudly berated her for throwing Mark into danger recklessly, emphasizing, “He’s just a kid!” (bonus drama: crushing Mark’s hopes to get with her…).

What’s interesting is that all of this is about fictional positioning- it’s not like Jono (who was playing Stacy) did anything mechanical or encouraged anything MORE dangerous than anything else in a Bliss Stage mission- it was just a combination of the prepped relationships and the way in which he expressed Stacy’s character and maybe a bit of girls ganging up drama.

Ken attempted to get Selene to open up, and she shut him down. The players joked about how this must just be the normal way they operate (“We put the Dys back into Dysfunctional!”).

And, Tamara confronted Prof. Alison. “You can’t just send Mark out there!” and “You ALWAYS say this is the last mission!” I grimly decided on the spot that Prof. Alison had a photo album of every pilot or kid she had lost in the Resistance – handing the Polaroid to Tamara- “Get everyone’s picture.”

Mission 2: Anime Exploding Doom!

Since a lot of the issues were already brought up during the Interludes, I kept the Briefing short.

The players did this awesome thing of getting some pre-mission chatter going on between the characters – which reflected both the stresses between the characters AND the sort of nervous non-chalant fronts folks put up to hide their stress.

The mission goals consisted basically 1) get to the Landing Platform and 2) Destroy a Support on the Platform. Since this ship is massive, the Supports were spread out, so each pilot was on their own.

Again, Anchors came up with a variety of dangerous alien threats to evade or fight. The Pilots also came up with appropriately anime scenes:

* Going gun/missle berserk as enemies swarm in, discarding empty missle pods and pulling off sections of the mech which are revealed to be new guns/missles until nothing but a skeletal frame remains.

* Blasting straight through one of the landing Supports in a head-first beam-cannon suicide attack

* Grabbing the top of a building which is converted through the magic of it being a Dream, into a building sized- energy sword.

Tamara Blissed first, and in doing so, managed to free all the Sleepers at the cost of being converted into an alien herself by destroying the Platform. Lisa was slamming the eject button, which was disconnected…

…and Selene Blissed right after her, from losing the relationship, and taking her busted skeletal Anima and doing a suicide run into the mass of alien enemies, telling Ken, “Don’t you eject me, don’t you eject me don’t you eject me…” before disappearing in a flash of light.

We decided after the fact that Selene has convinced the mechanic, Sae Sae, to disconnect her eject and that of Tamara’s, while leaving Mark’s connected.

In the epilogue, Ken was travelling to the families of all the kids lost in the Resistance to tell them what happened to their kids.

Lisa had become a legitimate authority on the Bliss, having kept meticulous, if a bit cracked, notes with each mission.

Mark was still trying to dive into the Dream to find Selene, with Lisa reluctantly helping. We ended with Sae Sae bringing them the letter Selene left, asking him to disconnect the eject buttons, and the door closing.

Overall, a great game.

Mechanics and such

The one big snag was that after the first mission and interludes, I realized no one was going to Bliss Out at this rate. I upped everyone’s Bliss by 20 (reflected in the documents now), so that it would time right. Whether that’s a little too much, or just right, I’ll have to find out with repeat plays.

Also, we only had one instance of Intimacy Building, which I’m not sure if that was because of people trying to play with unknown players, the general demographic, or what.

Two surprises in running the game.

First, players didn’t do any trust breaking during the interludes. It’s kind of neat how that also scales based on fictional positioning- if your character doesn’t trust someone already, you’re not going to deal with a Trust Breaking situation.

Second, a few relationships go a long way. Players did well by choosing only a few relationships for dice. Part of this might be the fact that Trauma is low for an endgame scenario so it’s not like everyone was scrambling for dice. On the other hand, the bad rolls were pretty bad.

For the first mission, I didn’t really worry about who/what I threatened, but the second mission I always targeted the High Intimacy/Low Trust relationships. That seemed to work well.

Players always prioritized Mission over everything else. Game-wise, that’s actually not a bad choice, since further rolls only mean more pain. I wonder if other choices would futz the numbers differently?

Overall, a great time with a new scenario, run for the first time. I’m going to have to run it a few more times and tweak details, but I’m happy with it.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Semantic transformation of Individualism concept from the perspective of Georg Simmel
Three Individualism forms: isolation, unique and moderntextarticle2016per Development of social segregation and individual processes in modern societies increasingly lead to expanding social circles in which a person can have mobility and transformation. Such circumstances, in contrast to the limited social relations in primitive and Premodern societies, lead to widening of the person''''''''''''''''s living area and personality development. In such a situation, a person as a member of different groups with different roles acquires more freedom and choices. Simmel by giving these pre-conditions, and examining the historical and social changes associated with the Renaissance and then, as well, recognizes three types of Individualism of isolation, unique and modern by defining individuality means a state of inner and outer liberation of person about the basic forms, which tendency to be each associated with socio-historical conditions of the 18th, 19th and 20th century has had the strength or weakness. This study tries to study the meanings of individuality and individualism and semantic transformation and its meaning in different centuries from the perspective of Georg Simmel, and explore the relationship between individuality and social structure.Society Culture MediaIranian Association for cultural studies & communication5

Changes of human mood are often linked to emotions and human beings are considered as emotional creatures. Emotion as a biological phenomenon was addressed by psychologists in the past decades. However, with advances in sociological studies and attention to language and its structural rules, there has been created more opportunities to study the sociological feelings. Were emotions considered as a physical phenomenon and biological changes once, they are considered as a linguistic phenomenon being resulted of cultural changes now. But like other sociological domains, this new one has also being influenced by theoretical discussions. The differentiation of opinion between positivists and social constructionists and role of social structure in the formation of feelings are involved among the discussions in this area. The article is due to by offering positivist and social constructionist perspectives and studying the role of power and statue in the social structure, contributes a little to the differentiation of these views in the area of the sociology of emotions.Society Culture MediaIranian Association for cultural studies & communication5

Rational approach based on a realist epistemology, considered science as a rational phenomenon, universal, non-social, one dimensional and ineffective of socio-cultural interests. But the cultural approach based on socio-cultural epistemology (or epistemological relativism) considered science as a quite social and cultural activity, and that have the fundamental connection with ideologies and socio- cultural values. Laboratory studies have focused on the interactions between the human and material vendors. Based on these studies, scientific activity is essentially local, mixed and accidental, so knowledge cannot be interpreted as an activity that obeys the rules of the scientific method. Laboratory studies of science showed that certain forces sociology and anthropology can enter the laboratory space, and show that there is also a political world filled with treaties negotiated and imposed to advancing to the paths accepted and based on seeing those things that should see them. In this paper, we introduce the tradition of laboratory studies in the sociology of science. And investigated the most important evidence and facts of this tradition in the sociologists of science and technology studies. Thus, we review the history of the laboratory studies, pioneers in this field are introduces (such as Michael Lynch, Karin Knorr-Cetina, Latour and Woolgar). Then, Bath school was considered as one of the main trends in this area, and in the end, the approach of laboratory studies was analyzed.Society Culture MediaIranian Association for cultural studies & communication5

"Republicans Suffering Death By A Thousand Cuts With Spending Bill

Do Republicans even give a damn about winning elections? It’s absurd I have to ask this question.

Right now, a Republican-controlled Congress is trying to spend trillions under the cover of darkness in the form of the latest omnibus spending bill. Remember this is the GOP—the supposed party of fiscal responsibility. Also remember, Congress’ primary constitutionally mandated responsibility is to be stewards of taxpayer dollars, a message Republicans should absolutely own.

So why vote GOP at all? Why should any Republican be remotely surprised if the base isn’t excited about sending any of them back to Congress?

In the same moment Democrats are hoping for a “blue wave” in the midterms, Republicans are busy giving liberals exactly what they want at every turn while giving its own base nothing. At a time when Republicans should be pinning Democrats on their heels, Republicans capitulate.

Republicans have to go on offense. They have to give people a reason to vote for them. There is absolutely nothing preventing Republicans from taking the lead on key themes and issues—immigration, Obamacare, Planned Parenthood—just name the battle.

But what do they do instead? They talk only about tax cuts and the mere fact that they aren’t Democrats.

Sorry, but “I’m not Nancy Pelosi” is not going to cut it in the midterms.

This isn’t 2012. Republicans controlled all three branches coming out of 2016 and conservatives still don’t have much to show for it. 2018 can’t be about tax cuts alone. The midterms will be won or lost primarily on whose base turns out. If Republicans cannot energize their base, they will stay home and Democrats win. If Republicans give Democrats everything they want, the base stays home and Democrats win.

And Republicans will be sent home.

Also, merely saying you’re “not a Democrat” doesn’t work well when too many Republicans voting records actually look far more like Pelosi’s than they should.

Going on offense will also be necessary to effectively combat the left. Republicans will need to stay one step ahead of Democrats at all times.

Some chatter on CapHill that if Pelosi were to exit (& this is just a theory), she would time her exit after GOPers bought ad time & burned $ campaigning against her. Sober GOPers know a Pelosi exit is bad for them as it robs them of a foil.

Obviously this is just a theory, but Democrats will definitely do anything they can to leverage Republicans against themselves—as Republicans continue to do everything they can to work against themselves and their conservative base.

If the GOP is serious about winning in the midterms, they need to give voters a reason why they should win. Repeatedly buckling on immigration, Planned Parenthood, healthcare and just about everything else is not the way to do it.

Passing a $1.2 trillion omnibus spending package in secret—the biggest bill of the year—is not the way to do it either.

The GOP won in 2016 because voters wanted a conservative agenda fought for and passed. Republicans prospects in 2018 will be a referendum on their ability—or ongoing pathetic inability—to get the job done.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"At 12:34 of the fourth quarter, Martellus Bennett hauled in a 5-yard pass, but was hit low by Burfict. Soon after that, Gronkowski started to speak up as pushing and shoving was seen on the field.

“That’s who we are. We always have each other’s backs,” Bennett said. “Things happen in the game. It was one of those things, it usually doesn’t happen that way, but Gronk’s like, ‘bro, I got you.’”

“I mean, he hit me in the back of my knee. That’s low,” Bennett added.

Later in the drive, Gronkowski was called for a taunting penalty after hauling in a 29-yard pass. On the next drive, the pushing and shoving became more apparent. After a 1-yard touchdown run, Blount was called for unnecessary roughness after fighting after the whistle blew. The back also got into it with Burfict multiple times.

“You play football, there’s a lot of guys – testosterone, egos, you know, you’re losing a game, you’re winning a game, you’re celebrating, everybody sees that you’re having fun,” Blount said. “When you have guys that are losing games, it’s not easy to take. That goes for everybody. We just got to keep our composure.”

During those drives, it also became apparent that Gronkowski was a target for Bengals players. Once someone gets a taunting penalty, they’ll get ejected if they get another. The tight end was asked if he felt the Bengals were trying to bait him.

“They do that every game,’ Gronkowski said. “If you watch film, they’re always baiting everyone to do that. They’re a tough, physical team. They’re physical football players. They’re big, and they hit hard. I feel like that’s the style that they play, so I kind of gave into it when I got my penalty.”

“We were just playing football, man. It gets like that sometimes,” Bennett added. “We’ve got guys who don’t back down from anyone and play hard throughout the whole game. That’s just the way it is. We don’t back down. We’re not looking for trouble, but we don’t walk away from trouble either.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"BlackBerry Z10 Returns ‘Exceed Sales’

The BlackBerry Z10 smartphone hasn’t sold well in the U.S., according to some analysts.

What could be worse for BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion Ltd. than weak early sales of its new flagship phone? The possibility that people who did buy the phone are returning it.

In two separate reports Thursday morning, analysts noted a weak launch of the BlackBerry Z10 in the U.S.

ITG analyst analyst Joe Fersedi writes that the Z10 launch “started poorly and weakened significantly as the days passed,” and that Z10 sales are “in line-to marginally ahead of anemic sales” of older BlackBerry models and the Nokia Lumia 822.

Fersedi said that initially the Z10’s share of sales was 4% at Verizon stores and 7% at AT&T stores, but those numbers have fallen to about 1% to 2%.

If you’ve got a mental health condition and didn’t get the higher rate of PIP mobility

The rules for getting the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) mobility component have changed. You are now more likely to get the mobility component if you have a mental health condition that makes it difficult for you to plan or make a journey.

Because of the change, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has said it will look again at any PIP claims which were decided after 27 November 2016 but before 28 June 2018 – you can check the date on your decision letter.

If you think this would change a decision made about your PIP then you can ask the DWP to look at your claim again. You can ask them to do this if you:

have a mental health condition that makes going outside difficult

didn’t get the mobility component of PIP or you got the standard rate of the mobility component

Ask the DWP to look at your claim again

If your PIP decision was made before 28 November 2016

If you didn’t get the mobility component or you got a lower rate than you expected, you might be able to get your claim backdated to before 28 November – contact your nearest Citizens Advice.

The DWP has written to some people who they think might benefit from the change. However the DWP might not correctly identify everyone, so you should contact them yourself.

Write to the benefit office listed on your original decision letter. Tell them you think the new rules mean you should have got the higher mobility component and you want them to look at your PIP decision again.

You'll need to include your:

National Insurance number

address

contact details

If you don’t have your original decision letter, call the PIP enquiry line to find out where to send your letter.

If you’re already getting PIP when you ask for a review

The DWP will look at your entire PIP claim again - this includes the care and mobility components. This means you might get less money overall than you were getting. If you’re not sure, contact your nearest Citizens Advice for help.

If you aren’t getting any PIP

You should make a new claim if you think you might now qualify for the mobility component – you don’t need to wait until your old claim has been reviewed. If you make a new claim you could get extra money sooner and they might backdate the payment.

How your claim will be reviewed

You won’t have to go to another face-to-face assessment. The DWP will review your claim by using all the information you sent when you applied.

If they need more information they might contact you or your doctor.

If you’re eligible for more money

The DWP will send you a letter after the review to tell you their decision. If you’re entitled to more money it will tell you how much you’ll get.

Your payment will be backdated to the date of your claim or when the mobility component rules were first changed (28 November 2016), whichever is later.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

My Favorite 1960s Dragnet #5: Juvenile: DR 19

Since March 2007, I've been podcasting one radio episode of Dragnet per week to recreate the experience of Dragnet's first listeners, as well as providing commentary and sharing listener feedback before and after the show. The show has listeners across America and around the World.

Also, I'll be posting a Monthly public domain Dragnet TV episode.

This definitely was a gut wrenching episode. You could tell how this case affected Friday and how he was involved in this one. In my opinion, the only parent(s) more despicable than the mother in “Juvenile DR 19″ were the self-centered couple in the season 2 episode “The Little Victim”. I wonder if both of these cases were investigated and tried in 2010 rather than 1967 and 1968, would the outcomes been different?",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"I guess just the measuring criteria is being posted today, then each subwoofer review after the holidays, then a final wrap up..ala shootout. Sounds like it might be another week or so for listening results.

I'm very much looking forward to the results! Just thought I'd post this here so that everyone was aware of it.

good grief!!! how are ANY of those subwoofers listed consider ""ultimate"" in ANY way??? Give me a break. There are so many other subs available that would destroy those listed and make them cry in their soup. Here's a more likely list of ""ultimate"" subwoofers

CS 18.2
eD A7-450 & up
Seaton subs
Epik subs
etc....seriously...what a joke. They should call this the ultimate basic subwoofer shootout. I'm not saying the subs listed are not good, but...their price points are all higher than they should be, their performance is definitely much less than can be had for the same money from other competitors.

Just as an example, compare the Rythmic 15"" sub listed to the Elemental Designs A5-350. Similar specs, but the eD is $400.00 cheaper and that INCLUDES shipping. Similar specs, so obviously a much better deal

I can see how the tittle can be misleading but thats no biggie. I'd say 70% of the new sub buyers will benefit from the results of this shootout. Sucks (for me atleast) that the entire details will be revealed in parts but AVH did all the hard work- putting money and time into this so they can milk it all they want.
GTG's can offer faster but similair benefits to the HT Sub community. If there is ever one in South Florida, I'd participate.

Wait and see. I'll bet it will show quite well among the competition it's in with. It's got a killer driver, a strong amp, and a very well designed box and porting system (think PB13 lite). Since the PB13 has been so extensively tested in the past, SVS suggested going with the PB12 Plus. It would be a mistake to underestimate it.

Just as an example, compare the Rythmic 15"" sub listed to the Elemental Designs A5-350. Similar specs, but the eD is $400.00 cheaper and that INCLUDES shipping. Similar specs, so obviously a much better deal

It's funny, cause I had the A7s-450, which is apparently a better sub than the A5-350, and the VTF-15H is way better.

Well..anything is possible, but I'd sure like to see some graphs and numbers to back up that claim. Care to offer any proof? You dont' have to do the testing yourself, just post the proof you seem to have.

I would expect the HSU to be much boomier since it's ported, but have a lot less slam and total clean output of the A7S 450 since you are comparing completely different beasts here.

Well, to be fair I am sure the HSU is great but Cacihome needs to tell people he is a HSU dealer or was which can make his opinions biased.

well, to be fair i am sure the hsu is great but cacihome needs to tell people he is a hsu dealer or was which can make his opinions biased.

ouch!!!

and just for the record I loved my HSU sub and have posted that several times. It was a great sub, and I'm sure the new 15"" is good too. I never said anything negative about HSU or their products. In fact, I directly compared the eD and the Rythmic as their specs are almost identical but price is 400-500 apart

and just for the record. I am NOT a dealer nor am I associated with any audio company in ANY way. I pay for my products just like you do...and I review them honestly without bias of any kind.

Well. These are the specs on the HSU 15"" and I have to say I find it VERY hard to believe that a 350watt rms amp and a 15"" driver could come anywhere near out performing an 18"" driver with 1300watts of power behind it. And btw...we are comparing a sealed to ported sub so I know that makes a big difference. You'd really have to compare it to an 18"" ported eD with 1300watts amp. or get eD to make you an A3-550 15"" ported WITH a 1300 watt amp.

also, you need to note that the HSU sub is $879.99 PLUS $139.99 shipping. So it's really $1019.98

Well. These are the specs on the HSU 15"" and I have to say I find it VERY hard to believe that a 350watt rms amp and a 15"" driver could come anywhere near out performing an 18"" driver with 1300watts of power behind it.

I would expect the HSU to be much boomier since it's ported, but have a lot less slam and total clean output of the A7S 450 since you are comparing completely different beasts here.

Whether or not the HSU is bommier is going to be dependent on the room conditions and the setup. From what I've heard about the A7S, in an open room, it's deep bass is weak without heavy eq due to the roll off which starts at a relatively high frequency. In apparently comes up short in comparison with the Chase products.

Unfortunately, in recent years it's hard to definitively prove anything when it comes to sub vs. sub since there is a lack of good standardized testing like Illka and AV talk used to do.

Its not a 350Watt amp. you should really post its a 1400Watt amp becaus that is the ratings others use.

You also need to post the driver sensitivity and Xmax of each driver along with the sub design (ported, sealed) to know the differences.

btw, what 18"" driver/1300 Watt subs are you refering too?

well, he was referring to the A7S 450 and so I went with that. But...the A3-550 is more in line with the HSU...but eD would need to put the 1300watt amp in that sub to make it a more comparable shootout I'd think

Well..anything is possible, but I'd sure like to see some graphs and numbers to back up that claim. Care to offer any proof? You dont' have to do the testing yourself, just post the proof you seem to have.

I would expect the HSU to be much boomier since it's ported, but have a lot less slam and total clean output of the A7S 450 since you are comparing completely different beasts here.

How be you back up your statement since you made it. Knowing how to cut 'n paste sub specs doesn't cut it and is no answer.
Of course if you have nothing to offer except sub ads feel free to go away.

I am pretty sure he was a dealer or something related to HSU. I had this discussion before with him when he was saying how much better the HSU ULS-15 was than the eD sub as well. It is OK to like something better but like I told Soundood even if the product is great coming from a dealer has little meaning. I can see loving a product so much that you become a dealer for it, I did for Ada!, but I also own the Krell right now and no Ada products. I am not in this for business. I am sure the HSU sub is an awesome product as HSU usually makes great subs(I have never owned any).

How be you back up your statement since you made it. Knowing how to cut 'n paste sub specs doesn't cut it and is no answer.
Of course if you have nothing to offer except sub ads feel free to go away.

Obviously you're just trolling.

Im' not sure what ""statement"" you are asking me to back up....other than my initial one saying that these subs are hardly the ""ultimate"" in subwoofers. I then went on to compare the A5-350 with the 15"" Rythmic and stated that they were virtually the same sub except the the Rythmic will cost you around $400-$500.00 more.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The results, released Tuesday, suggest that even as financial institutions implement more sophisticated fraud-mitigation techniques, they have not been keeping pace with criminals. The challenges are particularly acute at smaller banks and credit unions, which comprised a majority of the survey’s respondents.

Still, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, which conducted the survey, said that its findings provide valuable insights about the usefulness of various fraud-fighting tools.

Of the banks and credit unions that participated, 63 percent said that fraud losses on signature-based debit cards were higher in 2016 than they were a year earlier, while only 15 percent said that losses were lower.

Similarly, 50 percent of the respondents said that fraud losses on PIN-based debit cards increased in 2016, while only 12 percent said that they decreased.

When asked about credit cards, 41 percent of the financial institutions said that losses rose, while 16 percent said they fell.

The survey found that when financial institutions were asked about paper checks, wire transfers, and prepaid cards, they were also more likely to report higher losses than lower losses.

The only exception to the trend was fraud involving funds credited to accounts using the automated clearing house network. Only 2 percent of survey respondents said that type of fraud increased in 2016, while 4 percent said that it decreased.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"2013: The Titanic Year?

| by Tisaranee Gunasekara

“We were on the Titanic and everyone knew it was hitting the iceberg” - Eric Hobsbawm (Interesting Times)

( January 3, 2013, Colombo, Sri Lanka Guardian) In 2013, Sri Lanka will continue to be blessed with a President who is intent on life-long rule and dynastic succession, at whatever cost; and a Leader of Opposition who unfailingly lends that President a helping hand, at crucial junctures.

The regime’s decision to boycott the Appeal Court hearing is understandable. Having conducted the most indefensible ‘trial’ in living memory, without even the barest show of impartiality or justice, the regime would not want to deal with questions it cannot answer and explanations it cannot provide. Since the impeachment was a witch-trial, the Rajapaksas have no choice but to hug the cloak of impunity ever closer and defy the courts.

The decision by Ranil Wickremesinghe, and it is indeed his decision to ignore the summons of the Appeal Court, is not so logical. It is in the interests of the UNP to assist the courts to uncover and expose the shenanigans of the impeachment. So what made Ranil Wickremesinghe make a decision which will hurt his party, the country and eventually himself (a subjugated court can be used against him, if the Rajapaksas decide that it is in their interests to promote an even more reliable tool as the leader of the UNP)?

The argument about parliamentary sovereignty does not hold water, because in today’s Sri Lanka it is the Rajapaksas who are sovereign. In Rajapaksa Sri Lanka parliamentary sovereignty is as much of a lie, as democracy, human rights, media freedom or a political solution to the ethnic problem. The subjugated UPFA majority in parliament has turned the legislature into a Rajapaksa-doormat. Just last month, the parliament, in violation of a Supreme Court ruling (by a bench headed by Justice Shiranee Thilakawardane), assented to a Bill which seriously eroded parliamentary control over finances, one of the few preserves the 1978 Constitution left under sole legislative aegis. In reality, parliamentary sovereignty is as dead as a dodo. It is one thing to embrace the restoration of parliamentary sovereignty as a desirable goal; it is quite another thing to elevate its corpse and strengthen the asphyxiating hand of the executive still further.

................... Summery: Play the video ...............

...........................................................

Today, both within and outside the impeachment process, the real conflict is between the executive and the judiciary, the Rajapaksas and the courts. The conflict between the legislature and the judiciary is a myth concocted by the Rajapaksas to hide their dynastic purpose; plus provide their puppets in the UPFA - and in the UNP - with a lofty-sounding excuse to do the inexcusable.

Ranil Wickremesinghe is too clever not to know this. His is a political decision, taken not in honest ignorance, but in conscious duplicity. In fact this is not the first time Mr. Wickremesinghe made a decision which brought him some very short-term and extremely ephemeral gains while harming his interests in the medium to long term. And he will persist in committing such small acts of hara-kiri, especially if the Rajapaksas continue to stir the UNP-leadership pot using their other tool, Sajith Premadasa. With the leader and the alternate leader of the main opposition party in thrall to them, the Rajapaksas are in an unassailable position, or will be once they have subjugated the judiciary.

The Consolidation of Rajapaksa Rule

The impeachment, nakedly unfair and glaringly unjust, is the most grievous blow the Rajapaksas have inflicted on Sri Lanka. It will push Sri Lanka beyond the threshold of liveability.

Once the impeachment is through, the Rajapaksas are likely to move ahead with lightening speed to appoint a more amenable chief justice and a more reliable prime minister. Both choices are of seminal importance to the Rajapaksa project. The Shirani Bandaranayake saga would have demonstrated to the Rajapaksas the danger of placing non-family members in positions of power. After all, the Siblings showered the husband of the CJ with undeserving honours, and believed that that would be a sufficient guarantee of her eternal obedience. But Shirani Bandaranayake did thwart the Rajapaksas-purpose, just five months after she became the CJ. In November 2011, a bench headed by Shirani Bandaranayake effectively killed the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act (the so called ‘Sacred Areas’ act, which sought to empower the regime to expropriate any piece of land by the simple expedient of fixing a certain label on it). The Supreme Court decreed that this Act cannot be presented in parliament without the consent of all the provincial councils; the regime was compelled to withdraw it. Perhaps that was the day the Rajapaksas decided that Dr. Bandaranayake must either be broken or evicted.

Given this experience, the Siblings would want to ensure that the next CJ and the next PM are totally committed to the Rajapaksa power-project, out of choice or necessity. And they will not hesitate to pick candidates who are appallingly unsuitable. Once the impeachment travesty succeeds, the Rajapaksas will not feel the need to bother about maintaining appearances (except internationally, until the Hambantota Commonwealth Summit is successfully concluded). After all, if the UPFA and the country can digest this impeachment, they can imbibe any abomination, without even a twinge of indigestion or nausea.

2013 is thus likely to be a fortuitous year for the Rajapaksas, however unlucky it may turn out to be for ordinary Lankans. The SLFP’s back is truly broken, as is evident from the grovelling conduct of senior and junior SLFPers throughout the impeachment process. The leasers of the SLMC, the CWC, the EPDP and other minority parties might make occasional noises, but will eventually knuckle down, placing their own powerless positions above their parties and their peoples.

And there is nothing substantial or worthwhile left of the UPFA left.

So 2013 is likely to be a year in which the Rajapaksas consolidate old gains and make new ones: “…the government was planning to make wide-ranging changes to the powers vested with the provincial councils…. Accordingly changes are to be made to laws pertaining to Police powers vested in Councils together with amendments to the law which states that in the event an Act regarding the subjects of provincial councils is to be tabled in parliament it should be passed by all nine provincial councils” (Daily Mirror – 1.1.2013). Once the impeachment is successful and the judiciary subjugated, the regime will be able to bring in any law it likes, including ones which violate constitutional provisions and/or the norms of natural justice. Bad laws will be passed by the subjugated parliament, and implemented to the letter by subjugated courts, rendering insecure the lives of most Lankans.

When Mahinda Rajapaksa won the presidency in November 2005, if someone foretold that this moment will arrive in just seven short years, would we have believed it?

2012 was bad; 2013 cannot but be worse, barring a miracle.

Referring to America’s critical failure to address the issue of gun control, massacre after massacre, Jon Lee Anderson asked, “Where is our threshold for self-awareness? What is our national threshold for shame?” (The New Yorker – 16.12.2012). It is a question we should do well to ask ourselves, as 2013 advances, the Rajapaksas progress and the country regresses.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Primary Magic: Technological Innovation.Secondary Magic: -Caster or Holder: Caster Magic. || Lost Magic. Description: - It all began when she was eleven years old. Kiki was always fascinated with technology, and frequently could be seen in her bedroom playing with spare parts and forming them into god knows what. From mechanical devices to various games for entertainment, everything she would make would be way ahead of its time. Her mother had no idea where she gained this intelligence from, it was rather strange yet intriguing, since Kiki was always a very smart girl. Succeeding with straight 100s in school, always showing up to places on time, being able to operate and work on lacrimas- she learned everything extremely quickly, almost too quickly. Her smarts seemed to work like a magnet, and with that, she began to do more then just make technological objects- she began to participate in two similar yet different lifestyles; hacking, and theft. She often could be seen sneaking around various cities, stealing from small stores and hacking simple lampposts. However, as she grew as a person, she also grew in these arts, and she began to learn how to prosper in life. People were easily manipulated, and her skills in hacking grew to be able to hack entire buildings, cities, governments. It was like a simple addiction, as her adrenaline would never stop pumping at the thought of these actions.

At fourteen years of age, she joined ""Calaveras de Azucar,"" a group of individuals with similar interests to hers. It was an organized crime syndicate of thieves, and her being the youngest of members often was a burden on her shoulders. Unlike her, they were all mages, and she was just a hacker with no magic but the means of technology at her side. After a year of living among them, she finally snapped and ran during the night from her home to Talonia. She ventured through the black markets, and eventually came across a woman which looked to be that of a scientist. The woman noticed that Kiki held many advanced technologies on her side, and ventured down into a secret underground surgical room with her. There, she was given a magical surgery, which gave her the powers that nobody else on Earthland would ever be able to experience. She was implemented with the Lacrima-Net itself, and her entire nervous system and veins were now rewired with technology. She was upgraded, and now had the magical powers of hacking on her side. She was now able to hack anywhere, and did not have to use tools- the only tools she would have to use would be her imagination and hands, which assisted her greatly. After the surgery, she returned to Calaveras de Azucar and showed them what she was capable of- which soon crowned her the commander of that gang. She was now a master thief and hacker, and could use her magic in all of her dark ways.

In using this magic, she can be seen doing nearly anything that she would wish to do. From creating motorcycles out of her mind to creating whips to beat people with, it is definitely versatile. She channels the magical energy through herself, she is her own magical medium- therefore there is no way to stop her. She uses this magic to get to her goal, whether this may be completing missions for her guild, stealing various high-value materials in heists, or hacking computers for her allies, she uses it for her own good along with the good of her amigos. She can be seen anywhere at once, she has taken her hacking into her own hands and has carried it out in her life. She is manipulative yet wise, and knows when it is appropriate to use each spell. It should be known that one should not stand in the path of Kiki, or else she will advance- no matter what the price will be.

Strengths:- Her magic is very geared to that of mobility and utility, therefore Kiki can be seen nearly everywhere in the battlefield at once. That is, if you can see her at all..- Since Technological Innovation revolves around technology and its entirety, her spells often form things out of thin air and nothingness. One minute there could be nothing next to you, and the next there can be a giant box glowing a bright purple sitting there. Her magic can be classified as a mixture of a caster and maker magic, unique to her and her only. - Being based around technology and the Lacrima-Net, Kiki can use this magic for her personal benefits as well. She can make large screens to play video games on, watch movies, and draw maps with a simple push of a button. Not only does this benefit herself, but this can benefit her allies in more ways than one. This magic is extremely versatile.

Weaknesses:- This magic, Technological Innovation, is not situated on any element in the slightest. This means that no matter what, her attacks do not do extra damage due to elemental bonuses and resistances. She fights with technology itself, not any elements. - Due to the nature of this magic and its abilities, each one is programmed with full technology and coding. A downside to this can be that each ability glows a beautiful purple, which can cause her attacks to be easily detectable by the enemy if she was trying to be discreet.- Technological Innovation definitely comes with its pros and cons when it comes to this, which is the aspect that the magic is full of utility spells. A con of this can be that she lacks the normal amount of other types of spells that a typical mage has, which are replaced with utility. - Tying into the last weakness, it can be seen that the spells that are not utility are typically supportive and offensive. She only holds a few defensive spells, as the rest are those stated previously.

Lineage:

Blessed by the Fourth Wall:

Blessed by the Fourth WallDescription: The ancestor in here could have turned into a god, but nooooo, he had to preserve the fabric of reality or something. For this lineage, this ancestor, known as the One Who Got Close, is the only one to have found the Fourth Wall of the world, giving himself the chance to break it and ascend to the heights that are unknown, basically, us. However, when told by the wall that breaking it would sacrifice everyone else in the world, the noble goody-two-shoes chose to stop himself instead and as a result, he was blessed by the Fourth Wall. This blessing would go down to his bloodline and now you, oh lucky guy, are one of his kin.Ability: The Fourth Wall respects the user's bloodline and has given those of it the Glimpse, the ability to see what the user should not be able to see. Of course, to respect the purpose of the Fourth Wall, the user can only see one ""Thing"" at a time. Such as a snippet from a magic or character app (See 2 strengths or 2 weaknesses, see 2 likes or 2 dislikes, and so on.), or from another post to know someone is for example pursuing them or that someone is going to make a certain attack on them within the current post. Usage: 5 post cooldown between uses.

- D - Industrialization: Kiki's magic was designed to help industrialize cities- it was made to assist those in the building industry, or at least for the user's own benefits, and was to be able to manipulate different types of metals for her protection and effectiveness. Therefore, Kiki gains a 10% damage increase while fighting in established cities.

- D - Hacker's Perks: Being able to hack high levels of technology, Kiki has learned how to react to certain types of enemies in a way that is slightly less harmful when taking damage from them. Lacrimas, being one of the most powerful of the technological items in Earthland, have become the prey of this ability. Kiki takes 10% less damage from attacks coming from Lacrima-based abilities.

- D - Living Tower: While being implemented with her magic illegally, she was implemented with the Lacrima-Net itself. Her body functions as a living iLac tower of sorts, thus allowing service to all allies in a 45 meter radius of her body. This works anywhere, including secluded areas that are far away from civilization. Not only that but she can charge iLacs if they are low on battery at a quick rate, allowing more access to planning attacks and access to the Lacrima-Net. It is as if she is a high-powered iLac, as she is able to produce screens in-front of her for personal use and preparing for attacks. Kiki can frequently be seen drawing on these screens for planning with her nails, as well as playing video games and music for personal use. Not only that, but she can sometimes be seen hacking with these screens as well, threatening those that she is trying to steal from with blackmail.

- C - Heightened Sights: In the procedure to expand her knowledge and level of closeness with the Lacrima-Net, the new inner-wiring essentially made it to her eyes. Kiki is able to see people through walls if there is a product of technology on the other side. This can count as iLacs, lampposts, and much more. When she sees these people, they appear as an outline of their person, and in coding of purple. This only works on beings equal or lower to Kiki's rank.

Spells:

Signature Spells:

Tech Blocks (D):

Name: Tech Blocks.Rank: Signature Spell. || D Rank.Type: Utility.Duration: Instant.Cooldown: Instant.Description: Mastering technology, Kiki has learned how to produce various objects out of thin air. One of the most useful is known as her ability ""Tech Blocks,"" which essentially works like a levitating stairway or sidewalk. To use this ability, Kiki forms a small square of technology in her hands and tosses it to a desired location (up to 30 meters away which travels at 15 meters per second), resulting in a glowing and rock-solid 45 meter long stairwell / sidewalk producing in that area. This can float in the air if necessary, as well as lay across surfaces such as water and spaces between rooftops. These blocks are very beautiful, and consist of a translucent body with what appears to be a glowing pink and purple liquid inside of it. However, this is just the way the ability was coded, as it is in reality just a neon-translucent glowing box. This ability can be used once per post.

Strengths:- This spell can be used as a way to escape those that are of a lower ground or high threat. An example of escaping would be running across the blocks as they are created on the skyline of a big city, in order to escape possible threats that are not able to travel from rooftop to rooftop. - Not only can this be used to transport Kiki, but other allies can run on this as well. However, they must be careful, considering these blocks have no ledges. One slip, and you can fall from a very far height if that is where the blocks are located. - Due to being the operator of these blocks, Kiki can control who can and cannot get onto these blocks. Therefore, enemies cannot get onto these blocks without instantly causing the part they step on to explode.Weaknesses:- These tech-blocks glow tremendously, therefore can be easily detected by possible threats. - This row of blocks only takes 20 damage to destroy, therefore if an enemy wants to destroy this escape-route, then they can very easily. This can be used to their advantage, as they can cause deadly falls if timing the destruction properly as Kiki escapes. When the row is destroyed, it explodes into a beautiful array of pink and purple glowing shards of floppy discs and shimmer. - Due to this being such a low rank spell, it can only hold so much. Therefore, only three people + their pets can be on the line of tech-blocks at a time. If another tries to get onto one, all active tech-blocks will immediately explode due to the weight limit exceeding capacity. - This block-row only lasts for one post, therefore they cannot stay there for too long of a time. Those who cross these blocks better hurry, or else they will explode under their feet.

Synth-Whip (User-Ranked):

Name: Synth-WhipRank: Signature Spell. || User Ranked Until S.Type: Offensive.Duration: Instant.Cooldown: Instant.Description: With the installation of her magic came a great change, for she now was able to use it has a way to carry out offensive strikes on the enemy with magical power instead of using guns and other weapons. One of the best yet simple of her offensive spells, Synth-Whip, is used to carry out quick and efficient damage on those that stand in the way of her path. To use this ability, Kiki only has to twinkle her fingers, causing them to emit a beautiful series of sparkles above them. These sparkles soon grow into two thin and long whip-like objects, which are made of pure light and tech. These whips are as beautiful as a sunrise, as they switch between blue, purple, and pink with shimmer and revolving inside as if they were liquid. Kiki is able to use these to perform a quick semi-melee attack by running up to the enemy and gashing the side of their body with these whips via swinging, dealing user-ranked damage (until S rank). When this strikes, the coding turns into a very hot format, therefore they may experience a burning sensation and singeing of clothes when struck. Kiki is able to strike units up to 5 meters away from her, and is travels at the quick speed of 4 meters per second. After it hits the enemy or misses, it will break into a beautiful array of shimmer. Kiki is able to use this once per post.

Strengths:- Swinging these multi-colored whips of pure technology, Kiki can deal quick and efficient damage to a single target. - Kiki is rather fortunate to be able to use this spell, considering most of her attacks fall under utility. In addition to this, she usually specializes in long-ranged offensive spells, therefore her using of a melee attack is very useful in quick and close-ranged battles. Weaknesses:- Being the spell this is, it is not able to hit more than one enemy at a time. Therefore, in 1 v 6 situations, this spell would be rendered nearly useless, as she would be outnumbered and only able to strike one individual. - Using this spell, it is typically used in melee situations where she would need to defend herself when up-close. Therefore, this attack is useless at far range, and should not even be wasted in doing so. If she uses this at a long-range, she will just be greeted with to whips in her hands with nothing to use them on. - Being a melee attack that is used by swinging the whips and hitting the target with force, this strike is capable of being blocked quite easily by an enemy shield or defensive spell. This is due to the whips being quite thin, however the wires are still quite powerful.

D Rank Spells:

Light-Cycle:

Name: Light-Cycle. ✧Rank: D.Type: Utility.Duration: 3 posts.Cooldown: 4 posts.Description: Some may wonder, ""How does the master thief of the Lacrima-Net get around?"" The answer is simple; her Light-Cycle. One of Kiki's personal favorite spells and abilities, this ability allows her to make a tech-filled motorcycle out of thin air. The way she conjures this is quite simple, for she twiddles her fingers and makes a small triangle of purple tech. She then throws it onto the ground in-front of her and backs up a few feet, and it expands into a large motorcycle that looks to be extremely futuristic. This motorcycle's wheels and build is very circular and sleek, and is made of pure and solid technology. It glows a beautiful purple where it is not solid black and grey, and the transparent purple parts look to be filled of pure purple shimmer and glitter. When starting, this motorcycle can reach speeds of 33.75 meters per second, which is definitely fast. When riding, due to the fast speeds it can travel up to, it leaves a faint trail of purple coding on the ground. After it has reached its maximum duration or Kiki simply is finished riding, it explodes into shimmer and computer parts. To avoid a possible fatal impact, it notifies when it is about to meet its final duration so the passengers can get off before it explodes.

Strengths:- Being able to make a motorcycle is an extreme perk for Kiki, considering it allows for a quick entrance and exit from battle for more than just one ally (being herself). - Not only is she able to ride this motorcycle, she can do badass tricks with it aerial style. From jumping from rooftop to rooftop with it to doing flips while doing at top speed, she definitely looks like someone you would want to be friends with while riding this vehicle.Weaknesses:- Due to the length of this motorcycle, it is only able to hold a set amount of people at one time. This is three mages and their pets, nothing more. If a fourth mage tries to get onto the motorcycle, it will not allow a start, and will only be able to function after they get off. - Since this motorcycle is able to be used in combat to escape or ride into it, it can only take 20 HP Damage before erupting into a mass of computer parts. However, it would be hard to hit this motorcycle, considering it can go very fast. It would be easy to take down if going slow, though. - Like most of her spells, this motorcycle greatly glows a purple color. This allows for the tracking of her location, as well as not being able to blend into the surrounding areas while using.

Techno-Invis:

Name: Techno-Invis.Rank: D.Type: Utility.Duration: 3 posts.Cooldown: 4 posts.Description: When getting her magic implemented into her veins and nerves, she was sure to make sure that this ability was implemented first. This was one of the abilities that convinced her to get the procedure, strictly because it would assist her in all things theft and combat. This ability, Techno-Invis, allows Kiki to go invisible for a short period of time. The way she activates this ability is quite simple, as she simply swings one of her hands across her face. This will make her fade into a purple silhouette of herself for a few seconds, and then will fade into the air as if nobody was standing where she was at the current time that it was activated. While invisible, she will not be visible to any eyes on the battlefield, and can run around freely as she wishes without any consequence- unless she gets hit.

Strengths:- Due to the ability to go invisible, this allows for secretive entrances and exits. An example of this could be if there was a hoard of enemies standing in the way, and the leader was in the back being guarded in the front with their guards. Kiki could activate her ability of invisibility and run behind the all of the guards and right behind the leader, put a gun to the back of their head, and fire. This can allow tactical moves that would be nearly impossible while in sight. - Being invisible has its pros and cons, as she fades into the invisible surges of the Lacrima-Net tower that is herself. She gains a slight speed boost of 5% while invisible, considering her technological senses and aura is heightened in this state. Weaknesses:- Being invisible is not as powerful as one may think, as it does come with things that one may not expect it to come with. When she is invisible, she is definitely still able to attack the enemy with various spells that she would wish to use. However, when she does wish to attack, her body will waver in and out of this state, making her presence known if the enemy does notice. While wavering, her body will show, which will be mostly her typical appearance with a few parts still slightly-invisible and glowing purple. This showing of parts of her body fades back into invisibility when the post that she attacks in ends. - Similar to wavering in and out when using attacks, this same situation occurs while being hit with attacks while invisible. If, lets say a water elemental, shoots a beam of water in the location of Kiki while invisible, her body will show in all effected areas she was hit for the rest of the post that she was struck on. She will, of course, take the full amount of the damage used in the enemy spell, and cannot avoid said damage while invisible unless she happens to dodge it. - While in the state of invisibility, some confuse the term with the state of being able to pass through walls and become one with air itself. Kiki is not capable of passing through walls or anything of the sorts, her body acts the same as it typically would- only with not being able to be seen and gaining a very small speed boost. If she were to try to pass through a wall while invisible, she would be greeted with a slam in the face with pure brick.

Suctions.png:

Name: Suctions.pngRank: D.Type: Utility. Duration: 3 posts.Cooldown: 4 posts. Description: Having this beautiful and useful magic based on technology while being a thief is very useful, and an example of the benefits can be seen in this ability. Known as ""Suctions.png,"" this useful ability allows her to scale walls at ease. The way she uses this is a bit different than her other abilities, as she first summons a small and levitating screen with nothing but a text box and a set of numbers upon it, similar to that of a phone or calculator. This levitating touch-screen is tied to her body in many ways. She then types in ""7819243260"" and hits enter, causing the screen to disappear and four magic circles to form, one on each hand and one on each area by the toes. These magic circles produce purple and pink objects which appear to be levitating suction cups, and although they are levitating, they are strongly tied to the areas of Kiki's body that they hover above. The two cups on the hands are used to do the climbing, while the two in the area of the feet are used to catch / assist climbing if necessary. With these cups allows the rapid climbing up walls, as previously stated.

Strengths:- This ability allows climbing even the flattest of surfaces, which is very useful when carrying out that of a heist. Kiki can be seen climbing various walls of skyscrapers to get to the top building, which is very useful. This cuts out the factor of having to sneak through the entire building to get to the top floor, which she could do easily, and cuts her chances in half of getting caught in the act of stealing riches. - When falling from great heights, such as a large building, Kiki would be able to catch herself with this ability. One may ask how she would be able to think so fast, considering she has to type in a long strand of numbers to activate these suction cups, but she has done this countless times in the past. As she falls, she can activate this ability and suction herself to the nearest building beside her, saving her life in the process. Weaknesses:- With every ability comes its cons, and this ability definitely has an amount of those. When climbing up buildings from the exterior, Kiki is unable to climb wet surfaces, such as ones effected by Rain and waterfalls. If she tries to climb these buildings while they are slippery, the suction cups simply will not stick, therefore she will be unable to do so. If she is falling from a building and it is raining, it is her best bet that she is damned. - While climbing for an excess amount of time, she may find herself in a bit of a bad situation. These magical circles that fund the cups only exist for so long, therefore if she climbs for too long they can eventually deactivate on her. Therefore, she will be in for a long fall, and eventually have a nice and quick meeting with concrete. - If trying to escape enemies in the form of climbing, Kiki may also find herself in a bit of a situation if the enemy is able to think smart enough. If they attack the suction cups themselves, each has a total of 5 HP, adding up to 20 HP total. These are very weak, therefore Kiki is best to not use them while trying to escape combat. However, they do make for a good entrance.

Lotus.jpg:

Name: Lotus.jpgRank: D.Type: Offensive.Duration: Instant.Cooldown: 2 posts.Description: Some may ask Kiki, ""Since you type in a code to use your suction spell, is there more codes that allow you to do different things?"" and the answer is a definite yes. Similar to ""Suctions.png,"" this spell, known as ""Lotus.jpg,"" is created in the same way. To use this spell, Kiki first makes a similar text box similar to a phone or calculator and types in the strand of numbers ""8293410273."" After hitting enter, a purple magical circle will open in-front of her and cause a large and glowing purple lotus flower to appear, floating in-front of it. This flower looks to be made entirely of coding and parts of a computer, and possesses a glowing center which looks as smooth as a polished rock. Kiki then twists her hand behind it, causing the flower to begin rotating quickly in a clockwise motion. As it twirls, the center begins to expand and glow, eventually firing a large glowing laser in the color purple. This laser is about 10 meters wide, and can travel up to 45 meters away in 33.75 meters per second. As it is shot at an enemy, it does 20 HP damage to the main target and 10 HP damage to anyone else caught in the blast. After the laser is released, the flower will burst into millions of fragments of purple glitter and non-harmful glass particles.

Strengths:- With this beautiful laser-beam comes its pros and cons, and being able to hit multiple people is definitely one of them. While it may not effect those that are hit after the main target, it is definitely a spell of great power, and is helpful due to the abundance of D-Rank utility spells. Weaknesses:- With most of the other spells comes the same issue in this one, as this lotus flower and laser glow tremendously. In fact, these glow a lot more than the average spell, nearly illuminating an entire dark-area. If she is trying to perform a sneak-attack, it is best for her to not use this spell.- Since multiple people are able to be affected by this attack, there also comes the issue that allies can be hurt as well. If they are fighting the enemy that Kiki is aiming for and gets in the way, they may be met with a bit of damage done to their end.

C Rank Spells:

Teleportation Detonator:

Name: Teleportation Detonator.Rank: C.Type: Utility. Duration: 5 posts. || Instant Teleport.Cooldown: 6 posts.Description: A quite useful ability indeed, Kiki uses this spell as a way to teleport to safety, exit fights quickly, enter fights quickly, scare enemies, and get to places she may not be able to access without magic. To use this ability, Kiki removes a large metal object from her back and holds it in her hands. This metal object has latches to the bottom of it, and glows a purple color in the center while the rest is silver metal. She then throws this object, which can travel up to 120 meters away at 90 meters per second. When this lands on a surface, it locks into the surface, and is unable to move unless 40 HP damage is done to it. Once this is latched onto a desired surface, it makes a bit of a ticking noise before it relieves itself, and casually sits there. Now you may ask, ""what is the point of this ability?"" The answer is that it has in no way been activated in this state, as it is merely waiting for activation. To activate, Kiki presses a small button attached to her leg, and she is soon teleported to the object that she had thrown in the beginning. While inside the instant teleportation, she goes invisible for a split second, and soon arrives on-top of the metal object, resulting in it breaking.

Strengths:- In using this ability, it allows for the rapid entrance and exit of fights if necessary. An example of this can be if Kiki is being extremely hurt in a city on street-level. She can quickly remove the metal object and throw it to the roof of a building, and soon escape the torment that she is facing at that time. - In relation to the previous statement, she can use this teleportation device as a means of getting to high and low places without harm. An example of this could be if she is having to go to a lower-platform over a deep hole underground. She can aim the teleportation device to land on the desired platform and teleport to it, rather than having to risk a long jump that could result in fatal injuries.Weaknesses:- Being a physical piece of matter can be a bit of a weakness, considering it does have a set amount of damage it can take before breaking. This is 40 HP damage, and when it does break, it puffs into a strong and opaque purple smoke-cloud.- When attempting to entire fights while using this teleportation device, it can definitely be risky in regards to Kiki's safety. An example of this could be if she threw it over a wall and higher-ranked mages were on the other side in a large group, as she could teleport to their location and not see them from the beginning. This would result in her taking great amounts of damage, which would not be good. - After she throws the teleportation device and teleports to its location, it will break and have the ability go on cooldown.

Tech-Grenade:

Name: Tech-Grenade. Rank: C.Type: Offensive. Duration: Instant.Cooldown: 3 posts.Description: After acquiring her technological advancements, Kiki desired different ways to defeat the enemy- ones that did not require her using her smarts. She stayed up for four days straight programming this ability into her system. To use this ability, ""Tech-Grenade,"" Kiki expands all of her fingers and causes five purple beams of light to shoot toward her hand from her fingers, resulting in the blank space switching into a purple haze of light. This light slightly expands and forms into a purple and glowing object, which is that of a grenade. This grenade is transparent and filled with purple and pink sparkling liquids, that of which are held in by a pin at the top. When wishing to use this ability, Kiki will remove the pin of the grenade and throw it at the enemy, traveling up to 90 meters away at 67.5 meters per second. On impact, this grenade detonates in a purple and pink explosion, dealing 40 HP damage to the first enemy hit and 20 HP damage to anyone else in the blast zone of 45 meters in diameter. This explosion is so beautiful, as it consists of pink and purple shimmer and immense amounts of smoke. It is a bomb, and should definitely be treated as such.

Strengths:- When throwing this grenade, it erupts into a circular area of damage that is 45 meters long across in every direction. Therefore, the closest one to be where the grenade is on impact will receive full damage. This is a blessing, considering many people are able to take damage at one time. This is very useful for Kiki, as she is able to use this grenade when trying to clear a large wave of weak enemies in a close vicinity of each-other. - Being a throwing grenade, it is made to be able to be thrown at a decently long rate. If she wishes to throw it over a wall that she knows enemies are on the other side, she is most likely capable of doing so and being successful in the process. Weaknesses:- As this is a grenade, removing the pin on the top of it causes it to be vulnerable to detonation. Therefore, if Kiki were to accidentally drop it or have it slip out of her hand, it could detonate at her feet and cause her to be in the center of the explosion. That would not be a good thing for Kiki, therefore she frequently holds it tight with the pin removed. - There comes some times where Kiki is unable to tell who is an ally and who is an enemy. If a group of people is approaching through the shadows, and she is unaware who they are, she may throw the grenade at them and cause it to detonate. If the group of ""enemies"" were actually her allies, such as Savage Skull, she would be in massive trouble. - One of the most beautiful of her abilities when detonated, this grenade explodes into a beautiful array of purple and pink smoke and sparkles. While this is a beautiful sight, the smoke and sparkles glow tremendously, therefore it is useless if she wants the attack to not be known.

Synth-Spire:

Name: Synth-Spire.Rank: C.Type: Offensive.Duration: Instant.Cooldown: 3 posts. Description: One of her most advanced abilities in her newly-wired nervous system, Synth-Spire, Kiki is capable of causing a large spire of technology to shoot from the ground into the air. To do this, she pulls both of her arms upward, which results in a large spire of transparent computer parts to shoot up from a large hole that she summoned into the ground. In doing so, she is capable to control this spire with her mind. The way she uses this beautiful spire is quite unique, as she is capable of ordering it to topple over. As it topples, it will fall in a general direction that she causes it to, resulting in it toppling over enemies and dealing 40 HP damage to the first hit and 20 HP damage to anyone else caught in the shadow of the falling object. This can be conjured up to 90 meters away from Kiki's current location, and is the same length in height. The spire is nearly 25 meters wide, and is filled with a beautiful array of purple and pink sparkles like a majority of her other spells. As it falls, it travels at a speed of 67.5 meters per second.

Strengths:- With the nature and width of this spire, it is capable of hitting multiples of enemies when falling. However, as it falls, it only does full damage to one individual, that being the first enemy that is hit. An example of this would be if she was ordering it to hit five individuals standing in a line. The man closest to the falling spire's inside would be hit first and receive full damage, while the rest would only receive half of the damage that the first struck would. Weaknesses:- Similar to nearly every one of her other abilities, this spire possesses a very radiant purple and pink glow that is produced from the inside of this spire. Therefore this would not be very a very wise spell to use if trying to be sneaky, but the real issue comes with the size of this spire. It is a very large spire, therefore the size + the glow will illuminate many areas. - When commanding this spire to fall, Kiki may find herself in the predicament that she cannot tell her allies and enemies apart once again. The glow that her spells produce is a glow, but a dark one at that, therefore she may find herself hurting her allies on accident.

Primary Magic: Technological Innovation.Secondary Magic: -Caster or Holder: Caster Magic. || Lost Magic. Description: - It all began when she was eleven years old. Kiki was always fascinated with technology, and frequently could be seen in her bedroom playing with spare parts and forming them into god knows what. From mechanical devices to various games for entertainment, everything she would make would be way ahead of its time. Her mother had no idea where she gained this intelligence from, it was rather strange yet intriguing, since Kiki was always a very smart girl. Succeeding with straight 100s in school, always showing up to places on time, being able to operate and work on lacrimas- she learned everything extremely quickly, almost too quickly. Her smarts seemed to work like a magnet, and with that, she began to do more then just make technological objects- she began to participate in two similar yet different lifestyles; hacking, and theft. She often could be seen sneaking around various cities, stealing from small stores and hacking simple lampposts. However, as she grew as a person, she also grew in these arts, and she began to learn how to prosper in life. People were easily manipulated, and her skills in hacking grew to be able to hack entire buildings, cities, governments. It was like a simple addiction, as her adrenaline would never stop pumping at the thought of these actions.

At fourteen years of age, she joined ""Calaveras de Azucar,"" a group of individuals with similar interests to hers. It was an organized crime syndicate of thieves, and her being the youngest of members often was a burden on her shoulders. Unlike her, they were all mages, and she was just a hacker with no magic but the means of technology at her side. After a year of living among them, she finally snapped and ran during the night from her home to Talonia. She ventured through the black markets, and eventually came across a woman which looked to be that of a scientist. The woman noticed that Kiki held many advanced technologies on her side, and ventured down into a secret underground surgical room with her. There, she was given a magical surgery, which gave her the powers that nobody else on Earthland would ever be able to experience. She was implemented with the Lacrima-Net itself, and her entire nervous system and veins were now rewired with technology. She was upgraded, and now had the magical powers of hacking on her side. She was now able to hack anywhere, and did not have to use tools- the only tools she would have to use would be her imagination and hands, which assisted her greatly. After the surgery, she returned to Calaveras de Azucar and showed them what she was capable of- which soon crowned her the commander of that gang. She was now a master thief and hacker, and could use her magic in all of her dark ways.

In using this magic, she can be seen doing nearly anything that she would wish to do. From creating motorcycles out of her mind to creating whips to beat people with, it is definitely versatile. She channels the magical energy through herself, she is her own magical medium- therefore there is no way to stop her. She uses this magic to get to her goal, whether this may be completing missions for her guild, stealing various high-value materials in heists, or hacking computers for her allies, she uses it for her own good along with the good of her amigos. She can be seen anywhere at once, she has taken her hacking into her own hands and has carried it out in her life. She is manipulative yet wise, and knows when it is appropriate to use each spell. It should be known that one should not stand in the path of Kiki, or else she will advance- no matter what the price will be.

Strengths:- Her magic is very geared to that of mobility and utility, therefore Kiki can be seen nearly everywhere in the battlefield at once. That is, if you can see her at all..- Since Technological Innovation revolves around technology and its entirety, her spells often form things out of thin air and nothingness. One minute there could be nothing next to you, and the next there can be a giant box glowing a bright purple sitting there. Her magic can be classified as a mixture of a caster and maker magic, unique to her and her only. - Being based around technology and the Lacrima-Net, Kiki can use this magic for her personal benefits as well. She can make large screens to play video games on, watch movies, and draw maps with a simple push of a button. Not only does this benefit herself, but this can benefit her allies in more ways than one. This magic is extremely versatile.

Weaknesses:- This magic, Technological Innovation, is not situated on any element in the slightest. This means that no matter what, her attacks do not do extra damage due to elemental bonuses and resistances. She fights with technology itself, not any elements. - Due to the nature of this magic and its abilities, each one is programmed with full technology and coding. A downside to this can be that each ability glows a beautiful purple, which can cause her attacks to be easily detectable by the enemy if she was trying to be discreet.- Technological Innovation definitely comes with its pros and cons when it comes to this, which is the aspect that the magic is full of utility spells. A con of this can be that she lacks the normal amount of other types of spells that a typical mage has, which are replaced with utility. - Tying into the last weakness, it can be seen that the spells that are not utility are typically supportive and offensive. She only holds a few defensive spells, as the rest are those stated previously.

Lineage:

Blessed by the Fourth Wall:

Blessed by the Fourth WallDescription: The ancestor in here could have turned into a god, but nooooo, he had to preserve the fabric of reality or something. For this lineage, this ancestor, known as the One Who Got Close, is the only one to have found the Fourth Wall of the world, giving himself the chance to break it and ascend to the heights that are unknown, basically, us. However, when told by the wall that breaking it would sacrifice everyone else in the world, the noble goody-two-shoes chose to stop himself instead and as a result, he was blessed by the Fourth Wall. This blessing would go down to his bloodline and now you, oh lucky guy, are one of his kin.Ability: The Fourth Wall respects the user's bloodline and has given those of it the Glimpse, the ability to see what the user should not be able to see. Of course, to respect the purpose of the Fourth Wall, the user can only see one ""Thing"" at a time. Such as a snippet from a magic or character app (See 2 strengths or 2 weaknesses, see 2 likes or 2 dislikes, and so on.), or from another post to know someone is for example pursuing them or that someone is going to make a certain attack on them within the current post. Usage: 5 post cooldown between uses.

- D - Industrialization: Kiki's magic was designed to help industrialize cities- it was made to assist those in the building industry, or at least for the user's own benefits, and was to be able to manipulate different types of metals for her protection and effectiveness. Therefore, Kiki gains a 10% damage increase while fighting in established cities.

- D - Hacker's Perks: Being able to hack high levels of technology, Kiki has learned how to react to certain types of enemies in a way that is slightly less harmful when taking damage from them. Lacrimas, being one of the most powerful of the technological items in Earthland, have become the prey of this ability. Kiki takes 10% less damage from attacks coming from Lacrima-based abilities.

- D - Living Tower: While being implemented with her magic illegally, she was implemented with the Lacrima-Net itself. Her body functions as a living iLac tower of sorts, thus allowing service to all allies in a 45 meter radius of her body. This works anywhere, including secluded areas that are far away from civilization. Not only that but she can charge iLacs if they are low on battery at a quick rate, allowing more access to planning attacks and access to the Lacrima-Net. It is as if she is a high-powered iLac, as she is able to produce screens in-front of her for personal use and preparing for attacks. Kiki can frequently be seen drawing on these screens for planning with her nails, as well as playing video games and music for personal use. Not only that, but she can sometimes be seen hacking with these screens as well, threatening those that she is trying to steal from with blackmail.

- C - Heightened Sights: In the procedure to expand her knowledge and level of closeness with the Lacrima-Net, the new inner-wiring essentially made it to her eyes. Kiki is able to see people through walls if there is a product of technology on the other side. This can count as iLacs, lampposts, and much more. When she sees these people, they appear as an outline of their person, and in coding of purple. This only works on beings equal or lower to Kiki's rank.

Signature Spells:

Tech Blocks (D):

Name: Tech Blocks.Rank: Signature Spell. || D Rank.Type: Utility.Duration: Instant.Cooldown: Instant.Description: Mastering technology, Kiki has learned how to produce various objects out of thin air. One of the most useful is known as her ability ""Tech Blocks,"" which essentially works like a levitating stairway or sidewalk. To use this ability, Kiki forms a small square of technology in her hands and tosses it to a desired location (up to 30 meters away which travels at 15 meters per second), resulting in a glowing and rock-solid 45 meter long stairwell / sidewalk producing in that area. This can float in the air if necessary, as well as lay across surfaces such as water and spaces between rooftops. These blocks are very beautiful, and consist of a translucent body with what appears to be a glowing pink and purple liquid inside of it. However, this is just the way the ability was coded, as it is in reality just a neon-translucent glowing box. This ability can be used once per post.

Strengths:- This spell can be used as a way to escape those that are of a lower ground or high threat. An example of escaping would be running across the blocks as they are created on the skyline of a big city, in order to escape possible threats that are not able to travel from rooftop to rooftop. - Not only can this be used to transport Kiki, but other allies can run on this as well. However, they must be careful, considering these blocks have no ledges. One slip, and you can fall from a very far height if that is where the blocks are located. - Due to being the operator of these blocks, Kiki can control who can and cannot get onto these blocks. Therefore, enemies cannot get onto these blocks without instantly causing the part they step on to explode.Weaknesses:- These tech-blocks glow tremendously, therefore can be easily detected by possible threats. - This row of blocks only takes 20 damage to destroy, therefore if an enemy wants to destroy this escape-route, then they can very easily. This can be used to their advantage, as they can cause deadly falls if timing the destruction properly as Kiki escapes. When the row is destroyed, it explodes into a beautiful array of pink and purple glowing shards of floppy discs and shimmer. - Due to this being such a low rank spell, it can only hold so much. Therefore, only three people + their pets can be on the line of tech-blocks at a time. If another tries to get onto one, all active tech-blocks will immediately explode due to the weight limit exceeding capacity. - This block-row only lasts for one post, therefore they cannot stay there for too long of a time. Those who cross these blocks better hurry, or else they will explode under their feet.

Synth-Whip (User-Ranked):

Name: Synth-WhipRank: Signature Spell. || User Ranked Until S.Type: Offensive.Duration: Instant.Cooldown: Instant.Description: With the installation of her magic came a great change, for she now was able to use it has a way to carry out offensive strikes on the enemy with magical power instead of using guns and other weapons. One of the best yet simple of her offensive spells, Synth-Whip, is used to carry out quick and efficient damage on those that stand in the way of her path. To use this ability, Kiki only has to twinkle her fingers, causing them to emit a beautiful series of sparkles above them. These sparkles soon grow into two thin and long whip-like objects, which are made of pure light and tech. These whips are as beautiful as a sunrise, as they switch between blue, purple, and pink with shimmer and revolving inside as if they were liquid. Kiki is able to use these to perform a quick semi-melee attack by running up to the enemy and gashing the side of their body with these whips via swinging, dealing user-ranked damage (until S rank). When this strikes, the coding turns into a very hot format, therefore they may experience a burning sensation and singeing of clothes when struck. Kiki is able to strike units up to 5 meters away from her, and is travels at the quick speed of 4 meters per second. After it hits the enemy or misses, it will break into a beautiful array of shimmer. Kiki is able to use this once per post.

Strengths:- Swinging these multi-colored whips of pure technology, Kiki can deal quick and efficient damage to a single target. - Kiki is rather fortunate to be able to use this spell, considering most of her attacks fall under utility. In addition to this, she usually specializes in long-ranged offensive spells, therefore her using of a melee attack is very useful in quick and close-ranged battles. Weaknesses:- Being the spell this is, it is not able to hit more than one enemy at a time. Therefore, in 1 v 6 situations, this spell would be rendered nearly useless, as she would be outnumbered and only able to strike one individual. - Using this spell, it is typically used in melee situations where she would need to defend herself when up-close. Therefore, this attack is useless at far range, and should not even be wasted in doing so. If she uses this at a long-range, she will just be greeted with to whips in her hands with nothing to use them on. - Being a melee attack that is used by swinging the whips and hitting the target with force, this strike is capable of being blocked quite easily by an enemy shield or defensive spell. This is due to the whips being quite thin, however the wires are still quite powerful.

D Rank Spells:

Light-Cycle:

Name: Light-Cycle. ✧Rank: D.Type: Utility.Duration: 3 posts.Cooldown: 4 posts.Description: Some may wonder, ""How does the master thief of the Lacrima-Net get around?"" The answer is simple; her Light-Cycle. One of Kiki's personal favorite spells and abilities, this ability allows her to make a tech-filled motorcycle out of thin air. The way she conjures this is quite simple, for she twiddles her fingers and makes a small triangle of purple tech. She then throws it onto the ground in-front of her and backs up a few feet, and it expands into a large motorcycle that looks to be extremely futuristic. This motorcycle's wheels and build is very circular and sleek, and is made of pure and solid technology. It glows a beautiful purple where it is not solid black and grey, and the transparent purple parts look to be filled of pure purple shimmer and glitter. When starting, this motorcycle can reach speeds of 33.75 meters per second, which is definitely fast. When riding, due to the fast speeds it can travel up to, it leaves a faint trail of purple coding on the ground. After it has reached its maximum duration or Kiki simply is finished riding, it explodes into shimmer and computer parts. To avoid a possible fatal impact, it notifies when it is about to meet its final duration so the passengers can get off before it explodes.

Strengths:- Being able to make a motorcycle is an extreme perk for Kiki, considering it allows for a quick entrance and exit from battle for more than just one ally (being herself). - Not only is she able to ride this motorcycle, she can do badass tricks with it aerial style. From jumping from rooftop to rooftop with it to doing flips while doing at top speed, she definitely looks like someone you would want to be friends with while riding this vehicle.Weaknesses:- Due to the length of this motorcycle, it is only able to hold a set amount of people at one time. This is three mages and their pets, nothing more. If a fourth mage tries to get onto the motorcycle, it will not allow a start, and will only be able to function after they get off. - Since this motorcycle is able to be used in combat to escape or ride into it, it can only take 20 HP Damage before erupting into a mass of computer parts. However, it would be hard to hit this motorcycle, considering it can go very fast. It would be easy to take down if going slow, though. - Like most of her spells, this motorcycle greatly glows a purple color. This allows for the tracking of her location, as well as not being able to blend into the surrounding areas while using.

Techno-Invis:

Name: Techno-Invis.Rank: D.Type: Utility.Duration: 3 posts.Cooldown: 4 posts.Description: When getting her magic implemented into her veins and nerves, she was sure to make sure that this ability was implemented first. This was one of the abilities that convinced her to get the procedure, strictly because it would assist her in all things theft and combat. This ability, Techno-Invis, allows Kiki to go invisible for a short period of time. The way she activates this ability is quite simple, as she simply swings one of her hands across her face. This will make her fade into a purple silhouette of herself for a few seconds, and then will fade into the air as if nobody was standing where she was at the current time that it was activated. While invisible, she will not be visible to any eyes on the battlefield, and can run around freely as she wishes without any consequence- unless she gets hit.

Strengths:- Due to the ability to go invisible, this allows for secretive entrances and exits. An example of this could be if there was a hoard of enemies standing in the way, and the leader was in the back being guarded in the front with their guards. Kiki could activate her ability of invisibility and run behind the all of the guards and right behind the leader, put a gun to the back of their head, and fire. This can allow tactical moves that would be nearly impossible while in sight. - Being invisible has its pros and cons, as she fades into the invisible surges of the Lacrima-Net tower that is herself. She gains a slight speed boost of 5% while invisible, considering her technological senses and aura is heightened in this state. Weaknesses:- Being invisible is not as powerful as one may think, as it does come with things that one may not expect it to come with. When she is invisible, she is definitely still able to attack the enemy with various spells that she would wish to use. However, when she does wish to attack, her body will waver in and out of this state, making her presence known if the enemy does notice. While wavering, her body will show, which will be mostly her typical appearance with a few parts still slightly-invisible and glowing purple. This showing of parts of her body fades back into invisibility when the post that she attacks in ends. - Similar to wavering in and out when using attacks, this same situation occurs while being hit with attacks while invisible. If, lets say a water elemental, shoots a beam of water in the location of Kiki while invisible, her body will show in all effected areas she was hit for the rest of the post that she was struck on. She will, of course, take the full amount of the damage used in the enemy spell, and cannot avoid said damage while invisible unless she happens to dodge it. - While in the state of invisibility, some confuse the term with the state of being able to pass through walls and become one with air itself. Kiki is not capable of passing through walls or anything of the sorts, her body acts the same as it typically would- only with not being able to be seen and gaining a very small speed boost. If she were to try to pass through a wall while invisible, she would be greeted with a slam in the face with pure brick.

Suctions.png:

Name: Suctions.pngRank: D.Type: Utility. Duration: 3 posts.Cooldown: 4 posts. Description: Having this beautiful and useful magic based on technology while being a thief is very useful, and an example of the benefits can be seen in this ability. Known as ""Suctions.png,"" this useful ability allows her to scale walls at ease. The way she uses this is a bit different than her other abilities, as she first summons a small and levitating screen with nothing but a text box and a set of numbers upon it, similar to that of a phone or calculator. This levitating touch-screen is tied to her body in many ways. She then types in ""7819243260"" and hits enter, causing the screen to disappear and four magic circles to form, one on each hand and one on each area by the toes. These magic circles produce purple and pink objects which appear to be levitating suction cups, and although they are levitating, they are strongly tied to the areas of Kiki's body that they hover above. The two cups on the hands are used to do the climbing, while the two in the area of the feet are used to catch / assist climbing if necessary. With these cups allows the rapid climbing up walls, as previously stated.

Strengths:- This ability allows climbing even the flattest of surfaces, which is very useful when carrying out that of a heist. Kiki can be seen climbing various walls of skyscrapers to get to the top building, which is very useful. This cuts out the factor of having to sneak through the entire building to get to the top floor, which she could do easily, and cuts her chances in half of getting caught in the act of stealing riches. - When falling from great heights, such as a large building, Kiki would be able to catch herself with this ability. One may ask how she would be able to think so fast, considering she has to type in a long strand of numbers to activate these suction cups, but she has done this countless times in the past. As she falls, she can activate this ability and suction herself to the nearest building beside her, saving her life in the process. Weaknesses:- With every ability comes its cons, and this ability definitely has an amount of those. When climbing up buildings from the exterior, Kiki is unable to climb wet surfaces, such as ones effected by Rain and waterfalls. If she tries to climb these buildings while they are slippery, the suction cups simply will not stick, therefore she will be unable to do so. If she is falling from a building and it is raining, it is her best bet that she is damned. - While climbing for an excess amount of time, she may find herself in a bit of a bad situation. These magical circles that fund the cups only exist for so long, therefore if she climbs for too long they can eventually deactivate on her. Therefore, she will be in for a long fall, and eventually have a nice and quick meeting with concrete. - If trying to escape enemies in the form of climbing, Kiki may also find herself in a bit of a situation if the enemy is able to think smart enough. If they attack the suction cups themselves, each has a total of 5 HP, adding up to 20 HP total. These are very weak, therefore Kiki is best to not use them while trying to escape combat. However, they do make for a good entrance.

Lotus.jpg:

Name: Lotus.jpgRank: D.Type: Offensive.Duration: Instant.Cooldown: 2 posts.Description: Some may ask Kiki, ""Since you type in a code to use your suction spell, is there more codes that allow you to do different things?"" and the answer is a definite yes. Similar to ""Suctions.png,"" this spell, known as ""Lotus.jpg,"" is created in the same way. To use this spell, Kiki first makes a similar text box similar to a phone or calculator and types in the strand of numbers ""8293410273."" After hitting enter, a purple magical circle will open in-front of her and cause a large and glowing purple lotus flower to appear, floating in-front of it. This flower looks to be made entirely of coding and parts of a computer, and possesses a glowing center which looks as smooth as a polished rock. Kiki then twists her hand behind it, causing the flower to begin rotating quickly in a clockwise motion. As it twirls, the center begins to expand and glow, eventually firing a large glowing laser in the color purple. This laser is about 10 meters wide, and can travel up to 45 meters away in 33.75 meters per second. As it is shot at an enemy, it does 20 HP damage to the main target and 10 HP damage to anyone else caught in the blast. After the laser is released, the flower will burst into millions of fragments of purple glitter and non-harmful glass particles.

Strengths:- With this beautiful laser-beam comes its pros and cons, and being able to hit multiple people is definitely one of them. While it may not effect those that are hit after the main target, it is definitely a spell of great power, and is helpful due to the abundance of D-Rank utility spells. Weaknesses:- With most of the other spells comes the same issue in this one, as this lotus flower and laser glow tremendously. In fact, these glow a lot more than the average spell, nearly illuminating an entire dark-area. If she is trying to perform a sneak-attack, it is best for her to not use this spell.- Since multiple people are able to be affected by this attack, there also comes the issue that allies can be hurt as well. If they are fighting the enemy that Kiki is aiming for and gets in the way, they may be met with a bit of damage done to their end.

C Rank Spells:

Teleportation Detonator:

Name: Teleportation Detonator.Rank: C.Type: Utility. Duration: 5 posts. || Instant Teleport.Cooldown: 6 posts.Description: A quite useful ability indeed, Kiki uses this spell as a way to teleport to safety, exit fights quickly, enter fights quickly, scare enemies, and get to places she may not be able to access without magic. To use this ability, Kiki removes a large metal object from her back and holds it in her hands. This metal object has latches to the bottom of it, and glows a purple color in the center while the rest is silver metal. She then throws this object, which can travel up to 120 meters away at 90 meters per second. When this lands on a surface, it locks into the surface, and is unable to move unless 40 HP damage is done to it. Once this is latched onto a desired surface, it makes a bit of a ticking noise before it relieves itself, and casually sits there. Now you may ask, ""what is the point of this ability?"" The answer is that it has in no way been activated in this state, as it is merely waiting for activation. To activate, Kiki presses a small button attached to her leg, and she is soon teleported to the object that she had thrown in the beginning. While inside the instant teleportation, she goes invisible for a split second, and soon arrives on-top of the metal object, resulting in it breaking.

Strengths:- In using this ability, it allows for the rapid entrance and exit of fights if necessary. An example of this can be if Kiki is being extremely hurt in a city on street-level. She can quickly remove the metal object and throw it to the roof of a building, and soon escape the torment that she is facing at that time. - In relation to the previous statement, she can use this teleportation device as a means of getting to high and low places without harm. An example of this could be if she is having to go to a lower-platform over a deep hole underground. She can aim the teleportation device to land on the desired platform and teleport to it, rather than having to risk a long jump that could result in fatal injuries.Weaknesses:- Being a physical piece of matter can be a bit of a weakness, considering it does have a set amount of damage it can take before breaking. This is 40 HP damage, and when it does break, it puffs into a strong and opaque purple smoke-cloud.- When attempting to entire fights while using this teleportation device, it can definitely be risky in regards to Kiki's safety. An example of this could be if she threw it over a wall and higher-ranked mages were on the other side in a large group, as she could teleport to their location and not see them from the beginning. This would result in her taking great amounts of damage, which would not be good. - After she throws the teleportation device and teleports to its location, it will break and have the ability go on cooldown.

Tech-Grenade:

Name: Tech-Grenade. Rank: C.Type: Offensive. Duration: Instant.Cooldown: 3 posts.Description: After acquiring her technological advancements, Kiki desired different ways to defeat the enemy- ones that did not require her using her smarts. She stayed up for four days straight programming this ability into her system. To use this ability, ""Tech-Grenade,"" Kiki expands all of her fingers and causes five purple beams of light to shoot toward her hand from her fingers, resulting in the blank space switching into a purple haze of light. This light slightly expands and forms into a purple and glowing object, which is that of a grenade. This grenade is transparent and filled with purple and pink sparkling liquids, that of which are held in by a pin at the top. When wishing to use this ability, Kiki will remove the pin of the grenade and throw it at the enemy, traveling up to 90 meters away at 67.5 meters per second. On impact, this grenade detonates in a purple and pink explosion, dealing 40 HP damage to the first enemy hit and 20 HP damage to anyone else in the blast zone of 45 meters in diameter. This explosion is so beautiful, as it consists of pink and purple shimmer and immense amounts of smoke. It is a bomb, and should definitely be treated as such.

Strengths:- When throwing this grenade, it erupts into a circular area of damage that is 45 meters long across in every direction. Therefore, the closest one to be where the grenade is on impact will receive full damage. This is a blessing, considering many people are able to take damage at one time. This is very useful for Kiki, as she is able to use this grenade when trying to clear a large wave of weak enemies in a close vicinity of each-other. - Being a throwing grenade, it is made to be able to be thrown at a decently long rate. If she wishes to throw it over a wall that she knows enemies are on the other side, she is most likely capable of doing so and being successful in the process. Weaknesses:- As this is a grenade, removing the pin on the top of it causes it to be vulnerable to detonation. Therefore, if Kiki were to accidentally drop it or have it slip out of her hand, it could detonate at her feet and cause her to be in the center of the explosion. That would not be a good thing for Kiki, therefore she frequently holds it tight with the pin removed. - There comes some times where Kiki is unable to tell who is an ally and who is an enemy. If a group of people is approaching through the shadows, and she is unaware who they are, she may throw the grenade at them and cause it to detonate. If the group of ""enemies"" were actually her allies, such as Savage Skull, she would be in massive trouble. - One of the most beautiful of her abilities when detonated, this grenade explodes into a beautiful array of purple and pink smoke and sparkles. While this is a beautiful sight, the smoke and sparkles glow tremendously, therefore it is useless if she wants the attack to not be known.

Synth-Spire:

Name: Synth-Spire.Rank: C.Type: Offensive.Duration: Instant.Cooldown: 3 posts. Description: One of her most advanced abilities in her newly-wired nervous system, Synth-Spire, Kiki is capable of causing a large spire of technology to shoot from the ground into the air. To do this, she pulls both of her arms upward, which results in a large spire of transparent computer parts to shoot up from a large hole that she summoned into the ground. In doing so, she is capable to control this spire with her mind. The way she uses this beautiful spire is quite unique, as she is capable of ordering it to topple over. As it topples, it will fall in a general direction that she causes it to, resulting in it toppling over enemies and dealing 40 HP damage to the first hit and 20 HP damage to anyone else caught in the shadow of the falling object. This can be conjured up to 90 meters away from Kiki's current location, and is the same length in height. The spire is nearly 25 meters wide, and is filled with a beautiful array of purple and pink sparkles like a majority of her other spells. As it falls, it travels at a speed of 67.5 meters per second.

Strengths:- With the nature and width of this spire, it is capable of hitting multiples of enemies when falling. However, as it falls, it only does full damage to one individual, that being the first enemy that is hit. An example of this would be if she was ordering it to hit five individuals standing in a line. The man closest to the falling spire's inside would be hit first and receive full damage, while the rest would only receive half of the damage that the first struck would. Weaknesses:- Similar to nearly every one of her other abilities, this spire possesses a very radiant purple and pink glow that is produced from the inside of this spire. Therefore this would not be very a very wise spell to use if trying to be sneaky, but the real issue comes with the size of this spire. It is a very large spire, therefore the size + the glow will illuminate many areas. - When commanding this spire to fall, Kiki may find herself in the predicament that she cannot tell her allies and enemies apart once again. The glow that her spells produce is a glow, but a dark one at that, therefore she may find herself hurting her allies on accident.

"Students at Terra Nova High School grow a farm -- and a unique produce business

Faith Cathcart/ The Oregonian
Jenny Carmona (cq), steps with care through the lemon cucumber patch at Terra Nova Farm. ""I really like harvesting. I like working with the plants, "" she says. For Carmona, a junior at Terra Nova High School, farming had a calming effect. ""It was kind of like an escape for me."" Paul Hudak watches the plow chisel through the sod of the baseball field. Hudak grimaces each time the plow hooks clank. Has the driver punctured something hidden under the soil -- maybe pipes?

Hudak's farmer friends have told him he is crazy to try to convert the field at Terra Nova High School into a productive student farm. And his untested idea of a student-run business selling produce to subscribers won't fly, either.

The new teacher will need to win over those students, quickly. He will peddle seeds, talk about soil pH levels and try to muster interest.

It will be a tough sell in a place where many of the 60 students have more important concerns: failing grades, relationship quandaries and just fitting in at Terra Nova, a small high school focusing on individualized learning in the Beaverton School District.

Undaunted, Hudak imagines students growing corn, kale and tomatoes on this 3/4-acre patch. But first, before the autumn rains settle in, the plow slowly cuts through the chunks of earth between second and third base.

The earth looks like fractured pottery, a sure sign of compacted clay soil, not friendly for fruits and vegetables.

Growing up in upstate New York, Hudak was surrounded by farmland. At 15, he worked on a farm where they grew everything from flowers to blueberries to squash.

He attended two colleges in The State University of New York system and fully intended to become a teacher. But he dropped out and veered in another direction.

""I knew that my calling was always agriculture.""

Hudak took a cross-country train trip, stopping at farms along the way to find the right farm. ""It was love at first sight coming through Oregon.""

At 21, he moved to Persephone Farm in Lebanon south of Salem to an apprenticeship with plans to one day buy his own farm. Hudak also traveled for a year, living on family farms in Finland, Belgium, France and Italy. He went on to start Forest Meadow Farm in Silverton with friends, then moved to Grants Pass to still another farm -- this one stocked an adjoining restaurant and bakery -- that fit his local food ethic: ""I'm a big proponent of not having to haul our food farther than we need.""

In 2007, he uprooted for a girlfriend in Portland. Within weeks, Hudak landed a part-time job with Terra Nova's Conservation Corps, taking students to do environmental service work and maintain parks in the Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District.

On his first visit to the school, he spotted the barren ball field behind it. ""I was like, 'Um, yeah.'""

Things just fell into place. Then-principal Gary Myers immediately saw that a farm fit the school's philosophy to connect kids with their interests and allow them to explore them with internships.

The school received a multi-year environmental education grant through the Oregon Community Foundation Gray Family Fund to start the farm and hire Hudak, 31, whose position is partly paid for by the Beaverton School District.

Hudak, who wears a perma-smile and describes his favorite foods as ""super good"" or ""ah-mazing,"" devotes long hours to planning the program.

""He sort of fell in our laps,"" Myers says. ""I just felt really fortunate to have him show up on our doorstep.""

***

Call Mike Morton a reluctant farmer. After three years of struggle at Sunset High School in Beaverton, the 17-year-old with the ear-length straw-blond hair lands at Terra Nova. He hopes to find a place where he can connect with teachers and raise his grades -- things he never did at Sunset because he felt out of place and disengaged.

His mom chides him to sign up for the farm internship, but Morton has seen Hudak, a jeans-and-shirt guy with a Zen-like demeanor, around school.

Until Hudak, who lets his curly, dirty blond ponytail stick out from a baseball cap, asks for help building a hothouse for tomatoes. Morton drafts a design within a day -- and he sticks around for the season. The kid who once slept in late, skipped classes, gave up on his plans of becoming a firefighter, finds something he's good at.

It's well into fall -- when farmers prep for spring -- and the students try to keep up with the heap of new information.

The first semester farm crew of nine page through catalogs with purple carrots and multi-colored squash. Most of them aren't wild about fruits and vegetables, but these are cool -- strange varieties grocery stores typically don't stock.

They order seeds, build an irrigation system. Though they will practice organic farming methods, they can't label the farm organic without official certification.

Even before the seeds are planted, students like junior Jenny Carmona can picture the field at harvest, brimming with fruits and vegetables. Even once-dubious students like senior Cassidy Ringwald -- who didn't like being told what to do and was on the verge of being kicked out of the farm program -- have come around. Ringwald, 17, who dresses in all black, now volunteers for extra chores and still manages to keep his grades up.

Hudak's enthusiasm is rubbing off.

***

Other schools in Oregon have gardens for the kids; some even provide fresh food for lunches. But Terra Nova's is believed to be the first high school community supported agriculture (CSA) program in Oregon, one of a handful across the country. Trillium Charter School in North Portland once operated a small CSA with students ages 8 to 12.

It's a simple notion. CSAs started in the 1960s in Europe and Japan -- a pact between consumers looking for quality food and farmers looking for stable markets. CSAs jumped to the United States in the mid-1980s and took off.

Furthermore, sustainable agriculture organizations have tried to spur interest among youth to teach them how food grows, where it comes from and about healthy eating.

There are more than 130 listings for Oregon CSAs on LocalHarvest.org, a Web site pinpointing such programs nationwide, including Terra Nova's, tucked away in Portland on Northwest Thompson Road near the Multnomah and Washington county line.

On the receiving end of Terra Nova's bounty is Carol Grimes, one of 18 subscribers. She lucks into the deal because of a chance meeting with Hudak at a farmers market. Other local CSAs are already booked with subscribers for the season. For $500, Grimes, who wants to eat healthier, picks up a box of seasonal fresh fruits and veggies each Thursday from May to October. The boxes are so full, she invites friends over for weekly dinner parties to spread the wealth.

""Knowing that I'm supporting a really valuable program that's in my own community, and in addition is with high school students,"" Grimes says, ""really makes this experience meaningful.""

Terra Nova students return from summer break just as the farm reaches full bloom. In one corner, tomatoes in reds, oranges and yellows dangle from the vine. Across the field, cornstalks and bursting sunflowers tower. Closest to the street, violet cosmos and soft pink straw flowers add crayon colors to a sea of green. Drivers speeding around the curve slow down. What's going on, they ask.

Levi Jennings is one of seven students picked to work with Hudak over the summer to manage the farm. A $12,000 grant allows each student to earn a small stipend. For many, it's their first job.

Jennings, who has a persistent 5 o'clock shadow, unlike his peers, is a human encyclopedia rattling off factoids about how flowers can suck away a plant's energy from the vegetables it produces. He demonstrates the correct way to pick Sun Gold cherry tomatoes, which are so sweet the students call them ""sugar bombs.""

""This plant is growing because of me,"" says the 16-year-old junior, whose interests in nature conservation and biology dovetail at the farm.

Students here have become independent. Instead of asking Hudak how to organize the hundreds of flowers they picked, they form an assembly line. Rock music blares from a boombox as students bundle the blooms into bouquets.

The farm, producing more than expected, signs up three more CSA members.

The work is a lot hotter than the students expected, too. ""This is a job that most people would kill themselves if they had,"" says Ringwald, who once nearly quit the farm program. ""In the summertime in the heat, it's horrible working out here. With Paul, he keeps our enthusiasm up a lot.""

But Carmona, who thought the farm would have chickens like her grandmother's farm in Mexico, sees the space as a refuge. During the summer, she stresses about her family's move into a new home. ""It's like a little sanctuary to go to.""

During lunch break, the crew sits together in Hudak's classroom. On this warm day, he carries in a watermelon from the farm. With everything they grow, the students sample it before giving it to members.

""This thing's a beast,"" Hudak says as he slices through the red flesh. As they eat, the room silences. Juice slides down the students' chins and onto their hands, crusted with dirt.

Hudak asks if they think this Crimson Sweet variety is good. They nod. ""We should do all watermelon next year,"" Ringwald says.

If they harvest the seeds, Hudak tells them, they can use them next season. Eventually, the seeds will adapt to Terra Nova's microclimate to make for even better watermelon.

""The way that humans evolve,"" Hudak tells them, ""plants evolve.""

This is a classroom without walls, where it's not about lecturing. Hudak wants his students to have fun, just as he did on his first farm job. Science served with watermelon.

***

It's late October, the last day of the first season. Farmer Greg Malinowski, who farms nearby and who helped plow up the sod last year, is back. He tills under any plants still left standing.

Instead of pottery pieces, the ground looks sifted. The till moves it like an electric mixer stirring dry chocolate cake mix. It's a testament to Hudak and the students -- and to the power of chicken manure, donated by Stutzman Environmental Products in Canby and the ZooDoo fertilizer from the Oregon Zoo -- to amend and fertilize.

The fall farm crew stops to watch Malinowski churn their year's work back into the ground. Student Mike Morton -- the once reluctant farmer -- stands there longest -- and says he's not sad to see the farm go because he knows its soul is still there. Then he holds out his digital camera to snap a picture of himself with the farm in the backdrop.

He's more excited about school and is on track to earn his high school diploma, one of the minimum requirements to becoming a firefighter.

Farming is still hippie, Morton says. ""I still think that. Maybe I'm just a hippie, too.""

Levi Jennings and Cassidy Ringwald didn't come to see any of the hoopla. They continue to wash beets. They've changed in little ways. Jennings eats healthier; his new favorite vegetable is kohlrabi, a small, bulbous, cabbage variety. Ringwald takes ownership in the garden, even warning students during a schoolwide farm tour not to step on plants. ""We grow with love,"" Ringwald says. Both say they'll be back next season.

That night, the students and CSA members come together for their third and last potluck: homemade pizza with tomatoes and pesto, stuffed acorn squash with melted cheddar cheese, fresh tomato salsa and pumpkin pie.

Hudak mingles with everyone. He wants to share the successful model with other schools. ""My biggest hopes were that the students would enjoy doing it. It's definitely inspired me to make this the best it can be.""

This winter, he will re-apply for the environmental education grant, though funds are not guaranteed. In order to make the program more self-sustainable, Terra Nova will try to double the CSA membership next spring.

Inside, everyone celebrates their first season.

Outside, just across from the party, the field still smells of a mix of cilantro, basil and dirt. Along with the good bugs and bad bugs that give and take from the farm, the students will return -- next season.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Set a release schedule

An ideal number of uploads

Uploading regularly (sometimes multiple times a day) is a big part of how gaming channels operate on YouTube. Frequent releases and urging viewers to subscribe may keep gaming channels on the top of their viewers’ minds, set audience expectations, and can help surface your videos more frequently.

When planning out how many uploads you want to release each day or week, ensure your proposed schedule will keep you sane and happy. It’s not a good idea to upload just to reach a magic number.

Remember to check in with your audience. Are they watching all of your uploads and loving your stuff? Try reading your comments and looking at your Audience retention and Watch time reports in YouTube Analytics to get a sense of how entertained your viewers are with the videos you’re producing. Your effort level and your audience’s response are two key indicators that can help guide the frequency of your uploads.

Don’t forget to promote your programming schedule so that your audience knows when and what they can expect from you. Consider adding a call-to-action in your videos, using branding elements like your channel banner or trailer to advertise your schedule, and sharing it on social media.

It’s ok to take a break or go on vacation -- but remember to let your fans know or film in advance and upload with the scheduler!

Tips

See it in action

While we don’t encourage you to make videos if you’re not feeling well, here Markiplier shows his fans why he may be taking a few days off from regularly scheduled programming.

Find the right formats

Gaming videos come in many shapes and sizes. There’s no need to stick with just one type. Many gamers have gone beyond the traditional “walkthrough”and “Let’s Play” formats to less traditional videos featuring on-screen appearances, long-form content and livestreams.

One of the best ways to see which types of videos you like to make (and what resonates with your audience) is by experimenting. Try out different formats until you find the ones that inspire and motivate you. Many creators have accelerated their growth and discovery by featuring several types of videos on their gaming channel.

Don’t forget that livestream is an option too. You can turn it on with the touch of a button and instantly be interacting with your audience in real time. With the Stream Now dashboard, it's super easy to create playlists of previous live streams and promote on social media.

Clintus games walks his viewers through an unboxing of his Super Geek Box.

Schedule around events

Search trends often spike around industry events or game launches. Some creators have found success by producing videos that relate to these. Always stick to what makes your channel work, but if you have the opportunity and inspiration to take advantage of these events, go for it!

Study the trends. Search traffic for a game often begins weeks before the actual public release --consider releasing a relevant video (like a preview before it comes out or an “unboxing” video to show your excitement about it! If you wait until the day of the release, you may have already missed a lot of potential viewership.

It may be helpful to write out a calendar. Just grab a planner and jot down some potential ideas and dates. Try to align them with gaming events or premieres you think are important. Not only will a consistent schedule help build viewership, but it can help you stay on top of your production schedule.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Getting Tired of Obama

Every day I see pictures of his ugly mug on the newsstands; and on the television; and everywhere else I look. Like “Big Brother” in George Orwell’s prophetic “1984” where the country was run by this guy everybody called “Big Brother,” whose face was EVERYWHERE. Where it was on your television when it was turned off, and that TV watched YOU. I’m getting to the point where I just turn it off whenever I see his mug. Sheesh!

VIAGRA FOR RAPISTS? No, none of the politicians in this ad voted for specifically a law to allow rapists and child molesters to be able to get Viagra at government expense. But every one that voted for Obama’s health care swindle voted for a bill that would ALLOW rapists and child molesters access to it after they get out of prison, so they can “get it up” to rape either adults or children, whatever they prefer.

“THE STAFF” DOES IT ALL: Politicians do practically nothing aside from voting and raising money for re-election. The “staff” does it all. They read the legislation (when it is read at all); they WRITE the legislation their principal introduces. They write the speeches he gives. They put THEIR ideas into his head (they call it “advice”). The congressperson just takes credit for what they do and collects his money. Every once in a while he goes into Congress and votes the way they tell him he should.

NO COMPROMISE: Obama and other Democrats whine about there being “no compromise” in Washington. They want you to think it is the Republicans who will not compromise, but it is the Democrats. They have many meetings at which they hear idea after idea from Republicans, but they reject them out of hand. Then they say “Republicans have no new ideas.” Actually, Republicans have plenty of ideas, but liberal Democrats won’t hear them. Republicans simply won’t compromise their basic principles and accept those of the Democrats (liberals).

OBAMA “NOT KING”: Obama bemoans the fact that he is not king. And he talks about “crushing your enemies, referring to those who disagree with him.” Since when are people who disagree with a president “enemies?” I thought he wanted to “get them involved.” You can’t do that if you consider them an “enemy.” This is the “great unifier.” Sheesh!

LARRY KING NEEDS TO BE RETIRED: He got confused the other day and accused that “WikiLeaks” guy of “walking off” his set. Only one problem; he didn’t. Larry’s getting really old and is showing signs of his senility. He ought to announce his retirement and go home to rest. He isn’t much good as a commentator, anyway. All he does is “throw softballs” at Democrats while ignoring Republicans..",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Bob Pulford spent five seasons as the Kings head coach (1972-77). Pulford is second all-time in Kings coaching history in games (396) and wins (178) and is third in Kings history with a .535 winning percentage. Pulford is the only Kings coach to ever win the Jack Adams award (1975), awarded to the NHL's Best Coach.

In Pulford's first year with the Kings (1972-73), the team was named “Most Improved” in the NHL and missed the playoffs in the last game of the season. His second year, the Kings made the playoffs for the first time in five years. His third year, the Kings had their greatest season ever finishing with 105 points and earning Pulford “Coach of the Year” honors. His fourth year, the Kings advanced to the second round of the playoffs for the first time in seven years and took heavily favored Boston to a seventh game in the Stanley Cup Quarterfinals. In his final year, the Kings again advanced to the Stanley Cup Quarterfinals and again, fell to the Boston Bruins, this time in six games.

Pulford played junior hockey for the Toronto Marlboros for three seasons from 1953 to 1956, winning two Memorial Cups. He moved up to the Maple Leafs for the 1956–57 season and remained with the team for 14 seasons. Pulford was named an NHL All-Star six times with the Leafs and registered four 20-goal seasons while winning four Stanley Cups in a span of six seasons during the 1960s. The Leafs traded him to the Los Angeles Kings on Sept. 3, 1970, where he played two seasons scoring 30-50=80 in 132 games as the Kings captain and retired as a player in 1972.

Pulford collected 643 points (281 goals, 362 assists) in 1,079 games for the Leafs and Kings from 1956-72.

After leaving the Kings, Pulford joined the Blackhawks organization as head coach and general manager. He served as coach on three separate occasions from 1977 to 1987. He was promoted to senior vice president in 1990, but took on the general manager's duties again from 1992 to 1997, from 1999 to 2000, and from 2003 to 2005. During his third stint as general manager, Pulford doubled again as head coach. His all-time coaching record is 361-325-136.

The Zero Excuses Workout

From the Experts at Men's Health

Prove you have what it takes to transform your body for good

Change your attitude; change your body. Yes, it’s that simple. Think about it: When guys start saying they don’t have the time, energy, or desire to exercise, it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. After all, you probably accomplish a lot in the day. In fact, you likely get done what you absolutely need to get done. But if you don’t truly classify working out as priority, you aren’t going to do it. And everyone knows it’s easier not to exercise, right?

Well, we say it’s not that hard to exercise. Especially when you use The Zero Excuses Workout. This three-day-a-week, fat-burning routine—designed by Men’s Health adviser Alwyn Cosgrove, C.S.C.S.— takes just 30 minutes from start to finish, including your warmup. And all it requires is pair of dumbbells. Can you wake up a half-hour earlier? Hit the gym on your lunch break? Skip an evening sit-com? Then you have the time. The question is: Do you have the heart—or do you have excuses?

DIRECTIONS
Alternate between Workout A and Workout B three days a week, resting a day between each session. So in Week 1, you might do Workout A on Monday and Friday, and Workout B on Wednesday. In Week 2, you’d do Workout B on Monday and Friday, and Workout A on Wednesday. Before each workout, perform the Warmup, which will boost your calorie-burn, reduce your risk of injury, and improve your performance in the subsequent workout.

"I am iterating over a table of guids and preforming some business logic on each. When that's complete, depending on what happened during the business logic, I may push the guid to a results table. It looks like my best, (only?), option is to create a hold using filedef and -WRITE the guid to that file.

A couple Q's:

1. I came across some code which suggests the way to approach this is something like:

FILEDEF RESULTS DISK ????/results.ftm-RUN

- begin my loop - do my work

- if I want to write the guid -WRITE RESULTS &GUID

- end of loop

Does that look right? Do I not need to define a mas file? If that is the right way to go about it I'm getting the following error so maybe I'm missing something?

2. I learnt a little while ago that if I want my holds to be removed at the end of the request I don't want ""ON TABLE HOLD AS 'foccache/temp_hold"" but rather ""ON TABLE HOLD AS temp_hold"" as foccache is session, the other route is for the duration of the request, (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong about that). So with that in mind, where would I want to create this hold if I want it to be deleted at the end of the request? So in the below code, what should ""????"" be?

"The first retrospective exhibition of works by Nikolai Kulbin (1868–1917) discovers the artist as a landscape painter with an analytical mind and yet an unspoiled vision, a prominent graphic artist who left many portraits of his contemporaries, a talented theatrical artist, and book illustrator.

The exhibition is dedicated to the 85th anniversary of Andrei Tarkovsky (1932–1986), famous Russian filmmaker and film director. A renowned master of cinema, Tarkovsky gained international recognition during his lifetime. He is considered the creator of a new language in cinematic art, having introduced new aesthetics and philosophy to it and influenced its further development.

The retrospective exhibition of one of the most prominent artists of the Soviet realistic landscape presents to the public around 70 works from the collection of the Russian Museum, the artist's family and private collections.

SUSTAINING AND CREATING exhibition is the result of successful realization of the program of support for the young artists Unusual Art that gives an incredible chances for the development of artist with limited physical opportunities in the age from 16 to 25 and allows them to receive the national recognition in the very beginning of their career.

The exhibition acquaints with the series that unites 64 works by the well-known contemporary Russian photographer who had a trip across Africa and portrayed the unique beauty of landscape of this exotic land and its inhabitants – the representatives of the various world of wild nature that is removed from destructive force of civilization and preserves its independence.

The exhibition is devoted to the creative oeuvre of two generations of the family of Petersburg artists Traugot: Georgiy Traugot (1903–1961), his wife Vera Yanova (1907–2004), whose works are presented to viewers for the first time ever, and their sons – Alexander Traugot (born 1931) and Valeriy Traugot (1936–2009).

The solo exhibition of Genia Chef presents the creative oeuvre of the well-known master of contemporary art who was born in the Soviet Union and from 1985 works in foreign countries (Germany, Austria, the United States of America, Spain).

The international exhibition of the children's photograph is the artistic and educational Photo-project that united the young masters of photograph from Cologne, Turku and St. Petersburg. The exhibition shows what the young Finns, Germans and Russians are interested in.

The Russia for All exhibition project by the inhabitants of Moscow Victor Bondarenko (the author of idea of the exhibition) and the artist Dmitry Gutov is connected with the practice of contemporary art and realized in the form of the trip across Russia with stops in different cities.

“Expedition” exhibition-installation created by the modern artists Mikhail Pavlukovich and Olga Subbotina in 2010 especially for the Festival of modern art “Living Perm” is holding within the framework of the Days of Perm Culture in St. Petersburg “Cultural Alliance”.

For the first time the exhibition of artworks by Mikhail Shvartsman from the collection of the artist’s family presents his graphic heritage as an organic, unique, marked by special virtuosic “making” branch of his creative oeuvre.

The Zone of Happiness exhibition shows four Olga Chernysheva's videofilms (The Unknown, Self-Studying, Dionysius Steamer, Train), as well as a series of drawings and watercolours created by the artist on the basis of her video- and photo-works.

The personal exhibition of Natalya Savinova showcases works, which has already became classic, from the State Russian Museum collection, as well as those created recently, which belong to the author and have never been shown to public.

The exhibition dated to the ninetieth birthday of the Swiss artist and philosopher Victor Ruzo introduces his works of different oeuvre periods, which depict his unique life story, a story of a peculiar oeuvre phenomenon.

Vadim Ovchinnikov is one of the most outstanding characters of underground of Leningrad, a member of TEII (Association of Experimental Fine Art) and of the Fund of Free culture, a memder and theorist of a group New artists.

The exhibition was prepared in cooperation with Swiss Cultural Center. Its main exhibits were historical documents and engravings from the Navy Archive, Russian National Library and the State Russian Museum.

Northeast Utilities in Connecticut Tuesday confirmed that it plans to turn over part of its IT operations to two India-based outsourcing firms, despite a recent push by state lawmakers to keep it from doing so.

NU says it employs some 400 IT workers, and ""will retain about half of those employees"" after turning some operations over to outsourcers Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, two of India's largest IT firms.

Today's announcement makes official what had already been suspected -- the company had told its IT workers weeks ago that it was considering outsourcing tech work.

The utility, which operates New England's largest energy delivery system, today said it is ""working with strategic business partners to help conduct the rest of the work - the majority of which will still be conducted locally.""

NU said it expects that 40 of its affected IT employees will be rehired by the outsourcers ""and will still work at NU facilities.""

In response to their lobbying efforts, several Connecticut legislators in 2003 introduced a series of bills to limit H-1B visa use, arguing that it was being used to transfer jobs overseas. The efforts were unsuccessful and eventually the Connecticut organization that fought visa use disbanded.

Utility jobs had been considered among the more stable in Connecticut, at least until NU merged last year with Boston-based utility NStar.

Company officials at the time told regulators and lawmakers that the merger would lead to savings. Once word leaked out last month that NU was considering offshore outsourcing in its IT department, state lawmakers responded.

""Shipping these good-paying jobs away will not just hurt Connecticut's economy, but it could also pose a serious security threat,"" said State Rep. Joe Aresimowicz, a Democrat and House majority leader, in a statement last week.

Connecticut's unemployment rate is at 8.1%, the 35th highest in the nation, and the state's labor pool has seen a slight decline in size this year.

In a statement today, NU said: ""We spent a great deal of time over the last year studying our combined, post-merger IT department and determined we had two very distinct business models - neither of which was best practice when compared with current IT models. In order to meet customer expectations and deliver the latest IT solutions, we have designed one integrated, forward-looking, technology-savvy organization.""

NU said the transition will begin in November and will last through June of 2014. The utility is offering employees a voluntary separation package.

John Miano, a programmer and attorney who founded the Programmers Guild, said that when he started following IT offshoring in mid-1990s, ""most of the (news) coverage was over incidents like this (NU's move) and there was shock.""

Now, most of the H-1B news coverage is about how bringing in more H-1B workers will create jobs, said Miano.

""The sad thing is these companies don't save any money doing this,"" said Miano. ""The problem is there is no management consulting dollars for telling people the risks and why nots of offshoring.""

Friday Funny Pages: Yoda Spit Take

Hello readers, it’s time once again for Friday Funny Pages. I haven’t posted a blog since last Friday, my apologies for the lack of activity but I’ve been focusing on my current job hunt which has been quite a feat in this dismal economy also the wife and I took a few days to go camping and escape from the disheartening reality of modern living if only for a little over 48 hours. Now I’m back, somewhat recharged, and ready to bare down and dive back into my regular writing agenda! So let’s get right to it shall we?

Today’s panel comes to us from the great, and now defunct, Star Wars Tales comic book. For those who might not know Star Wars Tales was a monthly collection put out by Dark Horse of two or three short stories set in the Star Wars universe. Generally these stories were not considered canon, rather they were imaginative little vignettes that would explore portions of the movies that went unseen or elaborate on details that were only mentioned in passing during the films. Many were interesting side-stories and serious explorations of the themes of Star Wars, while others were goofball parodies and comedic asides. This panel comes to use from the latter category. This panel is intended to be funny. The image comes from a story entitled “Force Fiction” written by Kevin Rubio with art by Lucas Marangon. The setting is a small cafe somewhere on Coruscant shortly after the events of Episode I, where Yoda and Mace Windu are discussing the fate of a certain young Force adept by the name of Skywalker. This particular spit take comes after Mace determines that he thinks Anakin Skywalker should be given Qui-Gon’s lightsaber and trained as a Jedi. Yoda isn’t too happy about it, and points out all the reasons why not to train the boy, reasons we as the reader know to be all valid points. That’s not the point of this story however, for as the two Jedi knights sit quietly eating their lunch a group of raiders suddenly smash through the front of the cafe intent on robbing the place and the story quickly becomes an homage to Pulp Fiction and the iconic scene with Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in a very similar small dinning establishment (of course I don’t need to remind anyone who plays Mace Windu in Star Wars).

Anyway it’s a funny little Star Wars bit and this image of Yoda taken by surprise is just really amusing to me. Also if you look closely you will see that Yoda is sitting in the Jedi equivalent of a booster seat. Good stuff. If any of you Star Wars fans out there have not made yourselves familiar with the stories in Star Wars Tales I suggest you do so ASAP. There are a ton of genuinely excellent Star Wars stories throughout the pages, both serious and funny. Though they aren’t putting out any new books anymore you can get Star Wars tales in trade paperback, there are several volumes available. At about $20 a pop it’s a worthy investment! May the Farce be with you!",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"I don't use NM for connecting to the Internet. So I think that should be stopped right away. Also I have ext4 filesystem so I assume lvm2-monitor can be safely turned off. My primary usage is surfing net and coding in Python (newbie though).

Which services should I disable so that unnecessarily resources don't remain busy?

2 Answers

You can do without NetworkManager, but I find it awfully handy for dealing with changing wifi on a laptop (which you say you're using). If you don't need it, though, no harm in turning this off.

acpid 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

This is probably what's making your power button work, and what makes the system suspend when you close the lid. You can live without it, but probably don't want to.

auditd 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

This is the userspace part of the Linux Auditing System, which is a more secure way of logging kernel-level events than syslog. Among other things, it records SELinux alerts. Strictly speaking, you don't need it.

avahi-daemon 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

This is for autodiscovery of services on a network — printers being a big example. It's not required.

cpuspeed 0:off 1:on 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

This will probably just start the right in-kernel CPU frequency scaling driver as an on-start operation, and not run anything. (And if it can't for whatever reason and runs the daemon, you probably want it.)

haldaemon 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

This runs hald, which is in the process of being obsoleted but which is, as of Fedora 14, still used for a few things. Best to leave it on for now

If you're sure you're not using lvm (note that you can use ext4 on top of lvm!), you can turn off lvm2-monitor, and the same goes for md software RAID and mdmonitor.

messagebus 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

This is the d-bus system message bus. If you're using a modern desktop environment, you'll basically need this. If you're not, you can get away without it, but will probably have to hack things up. (I'm pretty sure gdm needs it, for example.)

netfs 0:off 1:off 2:off 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

This doesn't run any daemons, but starts any network filesystems in /etc/fstab/. It's harmless either way.

If you're not using NFS, NIS, or some other RPC-based service, all of these can go off.

rsyslog 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

You technically don't need to log anything, but you probably really want to. You could consider tuning it to work in a more lightweight way on your laptop.

smolt 0:off 1:off 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

This sends anonymized usage statistics back to the Fedora Project. It doesn't run anything, but there's a cron file in /etc/cron.d/smolt which checks the state here. If you don't want it, I suggest removing the entire smolt package. (But consider leaving it — the data is useful to the people putting the distro together for you, and it's only once a month.)

udev-post 0:off 1:on 2:on 3:on 4:on 5:on 6:off

Another run-and-done startup script, this one needed to keep rules generated during the boot process around once the system is up. Leave it on.

It's possible (and likely, if you didn't specify otherwise in the installer) that you are still using LVM with ext4 on the logical volumes, however, lvm2-monitor is really only useful if you're using LVM snapshots and/or mirrors, so it is safe to trun off.

Are you using NFS in any way? If not, you can probably safely turn off the netfs, nfslock and rpc* services.

Do you use any mDNS (or ZeroConf) devices? Avahi-daemon both registers your computer as a mdns device and enables your system to search for similar devices. If you don't plan on ever using that, you can disable it.

The other services are fairly normal to have running (like rsyslog), or are simply startup processes that don't leave around running processes (like smolt and udev-post).",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"About 100 people gathered at the School of Image Arts last Tuesday for the new building’s official opening, with an open bar and hors d’oeuvres such as stuffed tomatoes and sliders. The renovation changed the exterior brick to glass and added LED lights to the outside walls. President Sheldon Levy and vice-president academic Alan Shepard gave speeches, hinting at the delays that displaced image arts students around campus for about a year longer than expected. People were smiling, laughing and enjoying the night, most of them glad the project is finally nearing its end.

Some students, however, are unhappy with their new academic home. They see little difference inside the building after the renovation. Some image arts (IMA) students are disappointed with the changes and don’t feel it was worth the time they spent displaced around campus.

“I expected a lot more to be changed given the time they took,” said Emily Goode, a fourth-year IMA student in an email. “The first floor is the only one that they fully renovated.”

The $71-million building project took about three years to complete. During that time, students used alternative facilities off-campus, and in Kerr Hall, the Victoria Building and the Rogers Communications Centre.

Although Goode said it was inconvenient, she didn’t mind using the other facilities. Still, she felt that the building improvements could have been more suited to the needs of students.

She’s not the only one. “The move out wasn’t that bad because we were all expecting this wicked building,” said Lukas Sluzar, a fourth-year IMA student. “But when we got back, we found that it was pretty much the exact same building. So a lot of us were pretty disappointed.”

The building project was a part of Ryerson’s Master Plan, an initiative to re-utilize campus space. The plan included construction of a gallery and research centre. The first exhibition to be showcased is Ryerson’s Black Star

Historical Black & White Photography Collection. The collection of 250,000 photographs, anonymously donated in 2005, was given to the school on the understanding that Ryerson would build a professional gallery to house it.

The gallery is still incomplete but is expected to open in September 2012.

“The building was really about the gallery,” said Alex Anderson, chair of image arts. “The focus of the design was how to add a world-class gallery . . . in an already built construction.”

Just under half of the funding for the project came from grants and the rest came from internal sources and donations.

Even with all the planning and announcements from the school, the lack of upgrades and improved facilities disappointed students. The fourth-year students are the only current students who have used the old building.

“The hallways were the exact same so I knew how to navigate around,” said Sluzar.

Some students felt the money could have been better spent.

“There are things image arts needs and a new coat of paint with some green tile and a glowing building are not on that list,” said Goode. “I would much rather have another studio space or spend the renovation money on new equipment.”

Anderson said that Ryerson didn’t dip into the equipment budget to fund the renovation.

Julia Hanigsberg, vice-president of administration and finance, said that the $32.9 million grant money went directly to fund improvements for the image arts program, not the gallery. “A major part of (the renovation) was the re-cladding of the building, bringing light into the building,” she said. She also said that renovations made the building more wheelchair accessible.

Even though the outside of the building was improved, the interior of the building only saw an increase in windows, study spaces and the addition of a gallery.

The new building, which is 14,000 square feet bigger, will have a new coffee shop — Balzac’s — scheduled to open next week.

However, Anderson said she understands IMA students’ disappointment with the lack of upgraded facilities.

“I appreciate their frustrations,” said Anderson. “There were limitations to the renovations . . . we didn’t get to upgrade to the top facilities, so we’re still dealing with the older production facilities. . . We’re working on that. We’re working around it.”

IMA students were told by administration that the value of their degrees would go up as a result of the building. However, as an academic investment, the building did not change the quality of education students received, according to some faculty.

“Certainly the money would have been better spent on things that would better equip the students for entry into the professional world. But it was never about improving IMA standards. It was about publicity, optics and appearances,” said one IMA faculty member, who wished to remain anonymous. “The basis of the school’s reputation is a lot more complex than impressions of a building.”

Anderson clarified. “It’s not the building. It’s the attention the building attracts and the opportunities the building offers to the school that would ultimately make it a more highprofile degree.”

Students can use the building facilities, but much of it is still blocked off. Signs placed on several doors read, “No Access. Construction Zone. Please keep out.” Men in hard hats work throughout the building, fixing rooms still inaccessible to students. By the time construction is complete, all of those who remember the old image arts building will have graduated, and incoming students will be none the wiser to how the building used to be.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"SANTA BARBARA -- In a conciliatory gesture to a grieving family, authorities are dismissing a criminal complaint over ""stolen candles"" against Isla Vista stabbing victim Cheng Yuan ""James"" Hong, which stemmed from a bizarre January spat with roommate and eventual mass murderer Elliot Rodger.

Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce E. Dudley told this newspaper that late Friday morning, she filed a motion to dismiss the case involving Hong, one of six people Rodger killed one week earlier. She said the infraction was minor enough to be outweighed by the healing benefit to Hong's San Jose family.

""It's in the best interest of justice,"" Dudley said. ""It's so small. I believe it's important to the Hongs that their son has no criminal history whatsoever. It's the right thing to do.""

Elliot Rodger, James Hong

That's in line with the feelings of the family, which described the theft claim as overblown. It gained a wide profile when in the wake of the killings, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office reported Rodger initiated a citizen's arrest of Hong after accusing him of stealing $22 worth of candles. Hong was booked and released and later paid a fine.

But Hong's brother said Rodger initiated the conflict when he took away Hong's measuring cup out of annoyance over his cooking, and Hong responded by grabbing Rodger's candles to force a trade.

""In response, Elliot called the police,"" said Hong's brother, who asked not be named to protect his family's privacy. ""What kind of person would call the police for such a petty argument?""

Dudley said she was willing to go as far as asking the governor to issue Hong a pardon and explored that option before determining she could clear Hong's record locally.

Hong, a Lynbrook High School alum, was one of three people stabbed to death by Rodger in their apartment the night of May 23 before Rodger got into his car and continued a rampage through Isla Vista where he shot and killed three people and injured more than a dozen others.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"JAPANESE researchers have implanted a small camera inside a mouse's brain to see how memory is formed, in an experiment they hope to some day apply to humans to treat illnesses such as Parkinson's disease.

The study, published in the Journal ofNeuroscience Methods and Sensors and Actuators, used a camera 3 mm long, 2.3 mm wide and 2.4 mm in depth, Jun Ohta, professor at Nara Institute of Science and Technology in western Japan, said.

Working with researchers at Kinki University, Mr Ohta implanted the special semiconductor camera inside the hippocampus of the mouse's brain, designing the devise so that a screen showed blue light whenever the camera captured memory being recorded by the brain.

The researchers injected the mouse with a substance that lights up whenever there is brain activity. The camera then captures that light and the visuals come up on a screen.

The team now plans to use the camera while the mouse is walking.

""We are thinking about how to apply this to humans, though we must be very careful, as it involves implanting something into the brain,'' Mr Ohta said.

""It would take 10 years at the earliest.''

The researchers hope the study will lead to new ways to treat Parkinson's disease, as they aim to have the camera track brain activity that trigger symptoms such as tremours.

I feel really badly about animal testing, and I try to live my life the most ethically as I can (no excessive leather products - thank you LV !, vegetarian, natural cleaning products, carpooling as much as possible etc).. with that being said, I understand that animal research is often done in order to gain further understanding, I just hope that it's being done in the most ethical way possible in order to minimize the suffering.

I'm possibly coming off as a hypocrite, since any intrusion in an animal's life may cause it unnecessary suffering.. this is just how I feel about it. I wish we could all just sing song and hold hands/paws !

LOL! Kumbaya is a great song!!

I would have to think that yes, they treat the mouse as ethically and carefully as they can, since they are recording brain waves, and pain will make the tests useless if the animal is in pain.

I abhor animal testing, especially when it's totally unnessary. One study I read about was testing lipsticks in the eyes of rabbits! I was so ticked off when I read that, WHY did they have to test it in an animals eyes... don't they know what they put in it? I mean, it's stupid... if the ingrediants are known, then the reaction should also been known. Besides, how many women do you know who miss their mouths completely and hit themselves in the eye?

I am pleased Ayla, you do make a concentrated effort to refrain from using animal parts and the like, but we depend on many animals for many things... got leather seats in your car? Leather furniture in your house? Leather in your shoes? Yes, I think we can minimize how much of animal products we use, but we can't completely stop from using some.

There was a time that Apple macOS was the best platform to handle multimedia (audio, image, video). This might be still true in the GUI space. But Linux presents a much wider range of possibilities when you go to the command line, specially if you want to:

Process hundreds or thousands of files at once

Same as above, organized in many folders while keeping the folder structure

Same as above but with much fine grained options, including lossless processing, pixel perfectness that most GUI tools won’t give you

The Open Source community has produced state of the art command line tools as ffmpeg, exiftool and others, which I use every day to do non-trivial things, along with Shell advanced scripting. Sure, you can get these tools installed on Mac or Windows, and you can even use almost all these recipes on these platforms, but Linux is the native platform for these tools, and easier to get the environment ready.

These are my personal notes and I encourage you to understand each step of the recipes and adapt to your workflows. It is organized in Audio, Video and Image+Photo sections.

I use Fedora Linux and I mention Fedora package names to be installed. You can easily find same packages on your Ubuntu, Debian, Gentoo etc, and use these same recipes.

Audio

Show information (tags, bitrate etc) about a multimedia file

ffprobe file.mp3

ffprobe file.m4v

ffprobe file.mkv

Lossless conversion of all FLAC files into more compatible, but still Open Source, ALAC

Has been said the Fraunhofer AAC library can’t be legally linked to ffmpeg due to license terms violation. In addition, ffmpeg’s default AAC encoder has been improved and is almost as good as Fraunhofer’s, specially for constant bit rate compression. In this case, this is the command:

Same as above but under a complex directory structure

This is one of my favorites, extremely powerful. Very useful when you get a Hi-Fi, complete but useless WMA-Lossless collection and need to convert it losslesslly to something more portable, ALAC in this case. Change the FMT=flac to FMT=wav or FMT=wma (only when it is WMA-Lossless) to match your source files. Don’t forget to tag the generated files.

Convert APE+CUE, FLAC+CUE, WAV+CUE album-on-a-file into a one file per track ALAC or MP3

If some of your friends has the horrible tendency to commit this crime and rip CDs as 1 file for entire CD, there is an automation to fix it. APE is the most difficult and this is what I’ll show. FLAC and WAV are shortcuts of this method.

Make a lossless conversion of the APE file into something more manageable, as WAV:

ffmpeg -i audio-cd.ape audio-cd.wav

Now the magic: use the metadata on the CUE file to split the single file into separate tracks, renaming them accordingly. You’ll need the shnplit command, available in the shntool package on Fedora (to install: yum install shntool). Additionally, CUE files usually use ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) charset and a conversion to Unicode (UTF-8) is required:

It is not UTF-8 encoded, it is some ISO-8859 variant, which I need to know to correctly convert it. My example uses a Brazilian Portuguese subtitle file, which I know is ISO-8859-15 (latin1) encoded because most latin scripts use this encoding.

Now we are ready to add them all to the movie along with setting the movie name and embedding a cover image to ensure the movie looks nice on your media player list of content. Note that this process will write the movie file in place, will not create another file, so make a backup of your movie while you are learning:

You’ll get a directory tree with decrypted VOB and BUP files. You can generate an ISO file from them or, much more practical, use HandBrake to convert the DVD titles into MP4/M4V (more compatible with wide range of devices) or MKV/WEBM files.

Convert 240fps video into 30fps slow motion, the loss-less way

Modern iPhones can record videos at 240 or 120fps so when you’ll watch them at 30fps they’ll look slow-motion. But regular players will play them at 240 or 120fps, hiding the slo-mo effect.

We’ll need to handle audio and video in different ways. The video FPS fix from 240 to 30 is loss less, the audio stretching is lossy.

# make sure you have the right packages installed
dnf install mkvtoolnix sox gpac faac

1 Photo + 1 Song = 1 Movie

The above method will create a very efficient 0.2 frames per second (-framerate 0.2) H.264 video from the photo while simply adding the audio losslessly. Such very-low-frames-per-second video may present sync problems with subtitles on some players. In this case simply remove the -framerate 0.2 parameter to get a regular 25fps video with the cost of a bigger file size.

The -vf scale=960:-1 parameter tells FFMPEG to resize the image to 960px width and calculate the proportional height. Remove it in case you want a video with the same resolution of the photo. A 12 megapixels photo file (around 4032×3024) will get you a near 4K video.

There is also a more efficient and completely lossless way to turn a photo into a video with audio, using extended podcast techniques. But thats much more complicated and requires advanced use of GPAC’s MP4Box and NHML. In case you are curious, see the Podcast::chapterize() and Podcast::imagify() methods in my music-podcaster script. The trick is to create an NHML (XML) file referencing the image(s) and add it as a track to the M4A audio file.

-Directory, -FileName and -RegionName specify the things you want to see in the output. You can remove -RegionName for a cleaner output.
The -r is to search recursively. This is pretty powerful.

Make photos timezone-aware

Your camera will tag your photos only with local time on CreateDate or DateTimeOriginal tags. There is another set of tags called GPSDateStamp and GPSTimeStamp that must contain the UTC time the photos were taken, but your camera won’t help you here. Hopefully you can derive these values if you know the timezone the photos were taken. Here are two examples, one for photos taken in timezone -02:00 (Brazil daylight savings time) and on timezone +09:00 (Japan):

This shows that the local time when the photo was taken was 2013:10:12 23:45:36. To use exiftool to set timezone to -02:00 actually means to find the correct UTC time, which can be seen on GPSDateTime as 2013:10:13 01:45:36Z. The difference between these two tags gives us the timezone. So we can read photo time as 2013:10:12 23:45:36-02:00.

The source code currently brings to life (as an example), integrated with some Bluemix services and Docker infrastructure, a PHP application (the WordPress popular blogging platform), but it could be any Python, Java, Ruby etc app.

Before we start: understand Bluemix 3 pillars

I feel it is important to position what Bluemix really is and which of its parts we are going to use. Bluemix is composed of 3 different things:

Bluemix is a hosting environment to run any type of web app or web service. This is the only function provided by the CloudFoundry Open Source project, which is an advanced PaaS that lets you provision and de-provision runtimes (Java, Python, Node etc), libraries and services to be used by your app. These operations can be triggered through the Bluemix.net portal or by the cf command from your laptop. IBM has extended this part of Bluemix with functions not currently available on CloudFoundry, notably the capability of executing regular VMs and Docker containers.

Bluemix provides pre-installed libraries, APIs and middleware. IBM is constantly adding functions to the Bluemix marketplace, such as cognitive computing APIs in the Watson family, data processing middleware such as Spark and dashDB, or even IoT and Blockchain-related tools. These are high value components that can add a bit of magic to your app. Many of those are Open Source.

UI to build, manage and execute the app delivery pipeline, which does everything needed to transform your pure source code into a final running application.

The Track & Plan module, based on Rational Team Concert, to let your team mates and clients exchange activities and control project execution.

This tutorial will dive into #1 and some parts of #3, while using some services from #2.

The architecture of our app

When fully provisioned, the entire architecture will look like this. Several Bluemix services (MySQL, Object store) packaged into a CloudFoundry App (bridge app) that serves some Docker containers that in turns do the real work. Credentials to access those services will be automatically provided to the containers as environment variables (VCAP_SERVICES).

Structure of Source Code

The example source code repo contains boilerplate code that is intentionally generic and clean so you can easily fork, add and modify it to fit your needs. Here is what it contains:

bridge-app folder and manifest.yml file

The CloudFoundry manifest.yml that defines app name, dependencies and other characteristics to deploy the app contents under bridge-app.

containers

Each directory contains a Dockerfile and other files to create Docker containers. In this tutorial we’ll use only the phpinfo and wordpress directories, but there are some other useful examples you can use.

.bluemix folder

When this code repository is imported into Bluemix via the “Deploy to Bluemix” button, metadata in here will be used to set up your development environment under DevOps Services.

admin folder

Random shell scripts, specially used for deployments.

Watch the deployment

The easiest way to deploy the app is through DevOps Services:

Click to deploy

Provide a unique name to your copy of the app, also select the target Bluemix space

The idea is to encapsulate all these steps in code so deployments can be done entirely unattended. Its what I call brainless 1-click deployment. There are 2 ways to do that:

A regular shell script that extensively uses the cf command. This is the admin/deploy script in our code.

An in-code delivery pipeline that can be executed by Bluemix DevOps Services. This is the .bluemix/pipeline.yml file.

From here, we will detail each of these steps both as commands (on the script) and as stages of the pipeline.

Instantiation of external services needed by the app…

I used the cf marketplace command to find the service names and plans available. ClearDB provides MySQL as a service. And just as an example, I’ll provision an additional Object Storage service. Note the similarities between both methods.

Creation of an empty CloudFoundry app to hold together these services

The manifest.yml file has all the details about our CF app. Name, size, CF build pack to use, dependencies (as the ones instantiated in previous stage). So a plain cf push will use it and do the job. Since this app is just a bridge between our containers and the services, we’ll use minimum resources and the minimum noop-buildpack. After this stage you’ll be able to see the app running on your Bluemix console.

Creation of Docker images

The heavy lifting here is done by the Dockerfiles. We’ll use base CentOS images with official packages only in an attempt to use best practices. See phpinfo and wordpress Dockerfiles to understand how I improved a basic OS to become what I need.

The CCS_BIND_APP on the script and BIND_TO on the pipeline are key here. Their mission is to make the bridge-app’s VCAP_SERVICES available to this container as environment variables.

In CloudFoundry, VCAP_SERVICES is an environment variable containing a JSON document with all credentials needed to actually access the app’s provisioned APIs, middleware and services, such as host names, users and passwords. See an example below.

A container group with 2 highly available, monitored and balanced identical wordpress containers

See the results

At this point, WordPress (the app that we deployed) is up and running inside a Docker container, and already using the ClearDB MySQL database provided by Bluemix. Access the URL of your wordpress container group and you will see this:

Bluemix dashboard also shows the components running:

But the most interesting evidence you can see accessing the phpinfo container URL or IP. Scroll to the environment variables section to see all services credentials available as environment variables from VCAP_SERVICES:

So I’m using sed, the text-editor-as-a-command, to edit WordPress configuration file (/etc/wordpress/wp-config.php) and change some patterns there into appropriate getenv() calls to grab credentials provided by VCAP_SERVICES.

Dockerfile best practices

The containers folder in the source code presents one folder per image, each is an example of different Dockerfiles. We use only the wordpress and phpinfo ones here. But I’d like to highlight some best practices.

A Dockerfile is a script that defines how a container image should be built. A container image is very similar to a VM image, the difference is more related to the file formats that they are stored. VMs uses QCOW, VMDK etc while Docker uses layered filesystem images. From the application installation perspective, all the rest is almost the same. But only only Docker and its Dockerfile provides a super easy way to describe how to prepare an image focusing mostly only on your application. The only way to automate this process on the old Virtual Machine universe is through techniques such as Red Hat’s kickstart. This automated OS installation aspect of Dockerfiles might seem obscure or unimportant but is actually the core of what makes viable a modern DevOps culture.

Being a build script, it starts from a base parent image, defined by the FROM command. We used a plain official CentOS image as a starting point. You must select very carefully your parent images, in the same way you select the Linux distribution for your company. You should consider who maintains the base image, it should be well maintained.

Avoid creating images manually, as running a base container, issuing commands manually and then committing it. All logic to prepare the image should be scripted in your Dockerfile.

In case complex file editing is required, capture edits in patches and use the patch command in your Dockerfile, as I did on wordpress Dockerfile.
To create a patch:

diff -Naur configfile.txt.org configfile.txt > configfile.patch

Then see the wordpress Dockerfile to understand how to apply it.

Always that possible, use official distribution packages instead of downloading libraries (.zip or .tar.gz) from the Internet. In the wordpress Dockerfile I enabled the official EPEL repository so I can install WordPress with YUM. Same happens on the Django and NGINX Dockerfiles. Also note how I don’t have to worry about installing PHP and MySQL client libraries – they get installed automatically when YUM installs wordpress package, because PHP and MySQL are dependencies.

To chose to go with Docker in some parts of your application means to give up some native integrations and facilities naturally and automatically provided by Bluemix. With Docker you’ll have to control and manage some more things for yourself. So go with Docker, instead of a buildpack, if:

If you need portability, you need to move your runtimes in and out Bluemix/CloudFoundry.

If a buildpack you need is less well maintained then the equivalent Linux distribution package. Or you need a reliable and supported source of pre-packaged software in a way just a major Linux distribution can provide.

The best balance is to use Bluemix services/APIs/middleware and native buildpacks/runtimes whenever possible, and go with Docker on specific situations. Leveraging the integration that Docker on Bluemix provides.

I’ve searched for a long time and finally found a US regular bank that will let me open a free checking account. It is BBVA Compass bank.

All these services are free: ATM withdraw and deposit (BBVA’s and AllPoint ATMs), full featured Internet banking, full featured mobile banking, Visa debit card, Apple Pay and more. The non-free services are listed here and exact rates depend on the US state where the account was opened.

To open a checking account, you must personally visit a physical branch in US and spend 40 minutes on an interview. You will leave the branch with an open account and routing numbers containing a $26 balance plus valid user and password that can be used on BBVA’s app and Internet banking. Free Visa debit card will arrive to some US address in a week or two, so no ATM until then.

They have 2 free checking account types. You should chose the one that includes free or charge AllPoint ATM usage which are very popular throughout US, and can be found in almost every 7 Eleven store. Use the AllPoint app to find one near you. (more…)

WordPress is packaged for Fedora and can be installed as a regular RPM (with DNF/YUM). The benefits of this method are that you don’t need to mess around with configuration files, filesystem permissions and since everything is pre-packaged to work together, additional configurations are minimal. At the end of this 3 minutes tutorial, you’ll get a running WordPress under an SSL-enabled Apache using MariaDB as its backend.

On December 3 Apple has open sourced the Swift programming language on Swift.org. The language was first released (not Open Source yet) about the same time as iOS 8 and was created by Apple to make Mac and iOS app development an easier task. Swift is welcome as one more Open Source language and project but is too early to make a lot of noise about it. Here are my arguments: (more…)

I don’t know about you senior bloggers but I’m starting to hate the way the WordPress community has evolved and what it became.

From a warm and advanced blogging software and ecosystem it is now an aberration for poor site makers. Themes are now mostly commercial, focused on institutional/marketing sites and not blogs anymore. WordPress is simply a very poor tool for this purpose. You can see this when several themes are getting much more complex than WordPress per se. (more…)

Before iOS 8, the Polar H7 heart sensor with bluetooth needed special apps to pair. Now it pairs natively on the Settings app and starts sending heart rate to the new Health app on iOS 8, which will keep recording the data and building a graph like this:

At the Fedora 20 release party another guy stepped up and presented+demonstrated OpenShift, which was the most interesting new feature from Red Hat for me. First of all I had to switch my mindset about cloud from IaaS (infrastructure as a service, where the granularity are virtual machines) to PaaS. I heard the PaaS buzzword before but never took the time to understand what it really means and its implications. Well, I had to do that at that meeting so I can follow the presentation, of course hammering the presenter with questions all the time.(more…)

Few weeks ago I attended the Fedora 20 release party at São Paulo Red Hat offices. It was nice to hang together with other Fedora enthusiasts, get a refresh about newest Fedora features and also share my experiences as (I considere myself) a power user.

For some reason nobody published a simple guide like this. Maybe nobody tryied this way. I just tryied and it works with OS X Mountain Lion on a Mid 2012 MacBook Air.

If you have a Mac computer or laptop and want to install OS X, and all that you have is the operating system installation ISO image, you just need an external USB storage (disk or pen drive) of 5GB minimum size. Those regular 120GB or 1TB external disks will work too.

Just remember that all data on this external storage will be erased, even if the Mac OS X installation ISO is just 4.7GB. So make a backup of your files and after installtion you can re-format the external disk and recover the files on it.

To make the OS X installation ISO image file usable and bootable from the external storage, use the Mac OS terminal app or, on Linux, use the command line. This is the magic command:

dd if=""OS X Install DVD.iso"" of=/dev/disk1 bs=10m

You might want to change the red part of this command to the disk name that you get when inserted the external storage. Remember to not use things like disk1s1 or, on Linux, sdc1. The highlighted blue part on these examples are the partition name, and you don’t want that. You want to use the whole storage, otherwise it will not boot the computer.

After the command finishes execution, boot the Mac computer with the alt/option key pressed. Several devices will appear on screen for you to choose wich one to boot. Select the one with the USB logo and called “EFI Boot“.

Mac OS X installation app will boot and you can start the process. Remember that the default behavior here is to upgrade the installed system. If you want a clean install, select the Disk Utility app on the menu and make sure you erase and create a new partition on the Mac internal storage.

As a side technical note, this is all possible because ISO images — primarily designed for optical disks — can also be written to regular other storages as pen drives. And Apple has also put the right bits on these ISO images to allow it to boot from non-optical disks too.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Hundreds of leads in case of missing Maine girl

Authorities in Waterville on Monday offered a $30,000 reward for information that would lead investigators to Ayla Reynolds.

Story highlights

20-month-old Ayla Reynolds was last reported seen more than a week ago

Her father said he doesn't know what happened to her

Ayla was at his home when she was last seen December 16

Police said Wednesday they have received 370 leads in the disappearance of a 20-month-old Maine girl, whose father reiterated he doesn't know what happened to her.

""It is important the public hear it from me personally that I have no idea what happened to Ayla (Reynolds) and that I am not hiding,"" Justin Dipietro said in a statement.

Authorities in Waterville on Monday offered a $30,000 reward for information that would lead investigators to find the girl.

Police Chief Joseph Massey said the last reported sighting of the toddler was on December 16, when her father said he put her to bed. Police are confident that someone took Ayla from the house, the chief said.

Ayla is described as having blond hair, being about 2 feet, 9 inches tall, and weighing 30 pounds. She was last seen wearing green pajamas with white polka dots and the words ""Daddy's Princess"" across the front. When she disappeared, the girl had her arm in a soft cast.

The toddler's mother, Trista Reynolds, told HLN's Nancy Grace last week that Dipietro waited almost 24 hours to take Ayla to the emergency room after the girl broke her arm several weeks ago. Reynolds also said her daughter often would return with bruises after visits with Dipietro.

Dipietro, 24, said he would never do anything to hurt Ayla, who was in his sole custody when she disappeared.

""The questions of Ayla's arm or bruises or anything else being said are simply ludicrous,"" Dipietro said in his statement. ""I would never want anyone to spend even a minute in my shoes. No one should ever have to experience this.""

Police searched Dipietro's home with his permission.

Reynolds, 23, on December 15, the day before Ayla went missing, filed a complaint seeking sole custody.

She told HLN she didn't tell Dipietro she was going to court because he was ""vindictive"" and ""verbally abusive.""

""Now, me and him had had the discussion within that week that he told me himself that he was going to file the custody papers against me,"" Reynolds said. ""So I decided to go and file against him.""

The mother told Grace that she had raised Ayla for 18 months and Dipietro became involved only after ""I needed to go and get a little bit of help for myself."" She told HLN she underwent rehab.

Police do not have anyone connected to the case in custody.

Dipietro, who released his first statement last week, Wednesday thanked those who are aiding the effort to find his daughter.

""I have to believe that Ayla is with somebody and I just want that person to find the courage to do the right thing and find a way to return her safely,"" the father said. ""The truth is the truth and when the case is solved it will be out there. Until then, please try to remain positive and hopeful as I remain confident that Ayla will return safely.""",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Ralph Blasey Jr. Vice President of Agency that is in charge of security for Comey, Brennan, McCabe, Rice & Lynch — NO COINCIDENCES!

Posted byu/Sea127 reddit.com

This article puts it all together. Very comprehensive and to the point.

No major issue with Mr Ralph Blasey Jr just “HAPPENS” to be VP over all Personal Private Security for Comey, Brennan, McCabe, Rice, Lynch, Podesta, etc? Yeap – she just has a normal everyday daddy and family we all have – and the public wasn’t suppose to know about…

PAST POSITION(s) – Her father Ralph G. Blasey Jr.—a proven CIA operative who, from June-1962 to January-1974, was the Vice President of National Savings and Trust of Washington, D.C.—a CIA black budget bank best known for being 100 paces from the White House, and whom, in 1998, was taken over by SunTrust Bank—whose majority share owner is the CIA-linked investment fund BlackRock. (NOTE – Blackrock Secret contracted worth $100s Billions.)

The main CIA operative involved in this war, and whom Ralph G. Blasey Jr. reported to, was Nicholas Deak (LINK)—a longtime OSS and CIA operative, both during and after World War II, who ran the CIA’smain BLACK BUDGET OPERATIONS under the direct command of the feared CIA Counterintelligence Chief James Jesus Angleton.

To how the CIA prevented the total breakdown of the Western banking system in 1982, was by their illegally laundering hundreds-of-millions of dollars of Colombian drug cartel cash into it to keep it afloatin an operation overseen by the CIA’s “James Bond of Money” Nickolas Deak—but when the President Ronald Reagan administration found out what the CIA had done, and started investigating it, saw Deak, on 19 November 1985, being assassinated in his New York City office by a homeless woman named Lois Lang. (It was alleged that one Ralph G Blasey Jr was assigned this Deep State Wetworks, since he knew and worked with Mr Deak, and was his Senior).

As CIA & FBI Directors come and go after 4+ decades, Mr Blasey stayed at the very top of CIA/FBI officials, and was transitioned into each new CIA/FBI Administration. If there is any Unelected, Stable, Reliable “Deep State” criminal agenda going on today, Mr Blasey Jr is a Major link Lifelong connection between each New Administration to carry out and plan any longterm “Criminal Coup” of our nation. Understand how someone 40+ years in the CIA from controlling Black Ops Secret Bank Budgets, to now Providing Personal Public Security to each of the “Deep State” criminals (Brennan, Comey, McCabe, Mueller, Rice, Lynch, etc) who have been fired, removed, and now facing criminal charges.

"Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company

Indian is an American brand of motorcycles originally produced from 1901 to 1953 in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States. Hendee Manufacturing Company initially produced the motorcycles, but the name was changed to The Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company [sic] in 1928.

The Indian factory team took the first three places in the 1911 Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. During the 1910s, Indian became the largest manufacturer of motorcycles in the world. Indian's most popular models were the Scout, made from 1920 to 1946, and the Chief, made from 1922 to 1953.

The Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company went bankrupt in 1953. Various organizations tried to perpetuate the Indian Brand name in subsequent years, with limited success. In 2011, Polaris Industries purchased Indian Motorcycles and moved operations from North Carolina and merged them into their existing facilities in Minnesota and Iowa. Since August 2013, Polaris have marketed three modern Indian motorcycles that reflect Indian's traditional styling.

"Formula 3 Red Bull Ring: summer weekend of MP Motorsport

The softest compound that Formula 3 got this weekend was the soft tyres with the red colour. Liam Lawson was 16th fastest when he completed his first push lap, Richard Verschoor 21st and Simo Laaksonen was 20th fastest. After their cooldown lap to let the tyres recover and to avoid traffic they went again back up to speed for improving their lap time. Simo Laaksonen did much better this time he was 7th fastest, Verschoor 13th and Lawson 15th. The quickest lap time during the first run was for Armstrong with a time of 1:19.866.

The second run on a new set of tyres got disturbed by a red flag caused by Logan Sargeant after he got launched off a kerb straight into the wall. The clock got stopped with 4 minutes and 13 seconds left. This meant that there was only time for an out lap and one last push lap. Richard Verschoor qualified 14th in that lap, Liam Lawson 17th and Simo Laaksonen 19th. The top 25 cars qualified all in one second! Two ART drivers got disqualified at the end, and this made all MP Motorsport drivers move up two places on the start grid.

Race one

Ricard Verschoor started 12th, Liam Lawson 15th and Simo Laaksonen 17th after they gained two positions because of the disqualifying of ART.
The start of the race went well and without any incidents. Richard improved one position, Liam went three places forward, and Laaksonen was the only one with a loss of three places. Liam Lawson overtook Richard during the third lap for the 11th position, but he fell back to the 14th position two laps later. Laaksonen was recovering from the first lap and gained back three positions. Some minor changes happened during the rest of the race. Verschoor managed to overtake Niko Kari for position ten but had to give it back for some laps before he took it back again. Richard eventually finished the race 10th, Liam Lawson 14th and 18th for Simo Laaksonen.

Race two

An excellent start for Richard Verschoor while he moved up four places during the first lap. Liam Lawson moved up to position 12 while Simo Laaksonen had to give up one position. Liam moved up another two places during lap three what made him 10th. The progress of Verschoor turned around at lap 8. He got overtaken by two drivers and one lap later by Vips as well. The virtual safety car went on in lap 11 and got switched off in lap 12 at that time Verschoor was 9th, Liam Lawson 10th and Simo Laaksonen 20th.

Lawson tried to overtake Verschoor on the outside of the second last corner during lap 14, but that didn’t work out. He dropped down to position 12. Lawson then got pushed off the track in the exit of turn three by Niko Kari. This resulted in a broken front wing for Liam Lawson what he had to repair in the pit. Richard Verschoor ended the race 9th but he got a penalty what made him 12th in the end. Simo Laaksonen finished 18th and Liam Lawson 25th.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Scenes from the Indian Film Industry

Ever since I started blogging, aside from a couple of reviews from the Indian Film Industry, most of my reviews have been about films made in the US. I think it is about time I did a little bit in promoting the wonderful cinema that is being produced in my own country, India.

Just a quick note to inform the worldwide public that most of the people in the Indian Film Industry and a whole lot of citizens of India do not like the title ""Bollywood"" that has become so popular internationally. It's pretty much considered degrading and disrespectful to a vastly talented and original film industry. So it would be nice if everyone recognized the Indian Film Industry as just that and not a re-hash of Hollywood.

So here is a list of just a few of my favorite Indian films. I would like to warn you that you might be shocked to learn that a number of these do not contain any lavish music or dance sequences :-)

Udaan (2010) - Udaan (Flight) is one of the few indian films reviewed on my blog. It is a brilliant coming-of-age film that traces the journey of a teenager returning to his authoritarian father after many years in a boarding school. The performances from all the actors are simply brilliant and the story is as real as it can be. One of the few recent releases that have gone under my all time favorites.

Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron (1983) - JDBY (Let It Go Friends) is a comic satire on the corruption that handicaps India and one which is unfortunately as true today as it was when the film was released in 1983. The movie is about two photographers who want nothing more than to run a successful photo shop, but due to unfortunate events get entangled in a murder that takes them from beautiful newspaper journalists, to shady business tycoons, to the middle of a rather modern theatrical performance of Ramaya (which is till date one of the most comic scenes in the history of Indian Cinema). It was also responsible for kickstarting the career of some of India's most prominent actors. If you find the movie interesting make sure you give Manjula Negi's article ""It Just Happened"" a read. Link to the article - http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/art-culture/it-just-happened

Khosla Ka Ghosla (2006) - Khosla Ka Ghosla (Khosla's Nest) is once again a look at real life. The movie follows a middle class family's ordeals as they try to recover a plot of land illegally taken over by a local property dealer. Done in a light heartedly subtle comical fashion, the movie doubles as a con caper film as well.
Note: ""Khosla"" is a common Indian surname.

Lagaan (2001) - Probably one of the most well known and popular Indian films, Lagaan (Tax) is a fictionalized period drama that is based in India during the British Raj. It has some great characters, dance, music, and in a nutshell its about a village's quest to get rid of the yearly tax they have to pay to the British by playing a cricket match against them. Please, even if you are not familiar with cricket, do not let is hold you from watching the movie.

Ek Ruka Hua Faisla (1986) - Loosely translated it means ""A held up judgement"", but what it really is, is a remake of ""12 Angry Men"". I have watched this film many a times over the years and just happened to watch 12 Angry Men recently. Maybe it is my fondness for the Indian version, or maybe I found that the supporting characters in the original lacked the depth found in the remake, I do prefer the Indian version a whole lot more. So, have a go at it, even if it is to compare the two.

Dil Chahta Hai (2001) - ""The Heart Wants"" or Dil Chahta Hai is another coming-of-age film following three friends as they learn about relationships, friendship, love, work and pretty much everything else that life is all about. Once again a great cast and interesting story with strong performances make this a must watch film. The film also had a very urban feel and look to it, and having lived in a metropolitan city all my life, it was something me and my friends could easily relate to.

Rang De Basanti (Pain It Yellow) (2008) - So, another coming-of-age film of sorts (Yes! I see a pattern here as well), the movie looks at the youth of India through its main characters. What the film brilliantly does is portrays their thought process, their beliefs, and their aspirations by giving them all dual identities. In the present time they are all college going individuals, but in a process of making a documentary they each relive an important character from India's freedom struggle. The movie moves seamlessly between the two eras and culminates as the lost young souls realize the importance of their identity and eventually take drastic measures to rid our nation of corruption. Inspirational and heartening are two words that really describe the movie.

Bluffmaster (2005) - I am sure a whole lot of my fellow countrymen and women will cringe at the fact that I recommended this movie as a must watch. The reason why I do recommend it is because it has good song and dance sequences (you didn't think you could get out of it... did you?), it makes use of multiple starts who go about doing their jobs commendably, and lastly it is about a conman, so you know you will have a pretty good twist at the end. Now, I am not going to name the english movie it is loosely based on, but it does take some inspiration from it. Nevertheless, this rather modern film is perfect for some light fun viewing.

Satya (1998) - The South East Asian film industry is in a league of its own. They have specially been known for making some phenomenal gangster based films. So, being part of Asia, India was not going to be left behind. Satya (Truth) is the journey of a young man from the time he comes to Mumbai to his untimely death. It is also a hard hitting look at the Mumbai underworld and the lives of the various people who are drawn into a lifestyle of guns, women, and shady deals. Watch it for its raw feel and for the various characters, each of whom makes the movie his/her own.

Iqbal (2005) - Iqbal is a story about, well Iqbal. An 18-year-old deaf and dumb village boy who has only one aspiration and that is to play in India's National Cricket Team. The story is less about cricket, but more about facing adversities in life and aiming towards your goal. Iqbal, in this journey of his, on one hand faces criticism from his coach and father, but on the other hand has his sister and a washed up ex-cricketer who support and guide him towards success. The movie is simply a reminder that you should never let go of your dream and hard work always pays off.

So there you have it. 10 films from India that are a must watch. They are all available on DVD and all come with english subtitles. So, if ever in the mood for some foreign (or local if you are from India and have not seen any of the above) film watching, do give these movies a try. You will not be disappointed.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"GM finally am able to get kind of caught up with all my blog sites. Have helped my older sister with her estate sale. And this week isn’t going to be any better. I signed up for a Debate Watch Party that should be fun. Watching upwithchris it about the Suprememe Court.
Hope everyone on TOD has a great day.

Morning all. Down with an awful cold, head stuffed, tears streaming, throat scratchy. Husband still in the grip of a nasty coughing cold. Still, the sun is up and the trees are turning beautiful colors, so all’s right with the world.

It’s a Good Morning here in the land of “Pleasant Living”. I hope everyone is doing well even with the fall allergy season. Just do something to help the POTUS today. Find one more person to register to vote.

In NYT, there’s an article, “Psst: We Feel Bad About Our Arms” and it shows 3 pictures of FLOTUS. “May I suggest that some of her colleagues, a growing cohort of copycat arm-flashers, might want to check the mirror before again preening sans sleeves? It’s time to face the truth: we don’t all look like the First Lady.” It compares FLOTUS fashion trend to others First Lady trends, as Mamie Eisenhower’s bangs, etc. Basically, we just have one beautiful FLOTUS, inside & out.
I meant to thank someone yesterday for posting that video of Michelle’s introductory speech for The 2008 Pres run – she’s just as special as he is.

The Up With Chris segment about the Supreme Court once again highlights why Pres. Obama and Democrats need to win. A rightwing court that will/choose to hear cases on affirmative action, voting rights act, marriage equality etc is a dangerous one.

Good morning every one. I remember that Black Female attorney from being at Rainbow Push on Saturday mornings. Nearly a year or so she exposed voter suppression and the map of shame in addition to how to fight back. Then she said voter suppression was either coming to our state or a state near us.

I posted their link here a while back. I see the map’s been updated. It is now an ” Animated Map of Shame” which allow you to click on it and see how quickly many states rushed to pass government-issued photo ID laws without considering the consequences.

Hi good Peeps,
Today’s a marvelous day. Enjoy it, but I must say that we have our work cut out or us. The corporate media has it’s marching orders to defibrillate Romney’s dying campaign by any means necessary. Why? Cuz media need their pound of flesh re: Romney’s & superpac ad revenue. GOP never intended for that inconvenient thing called Democracy to get in the way of their venal agenda. There’s very little difference between what al Qaeda has done and the tactics of the GOP. I’m not being hyperbolic here. These people WANT power. All of it. They’ll do anything, anything, to get it.

So folks whatever we can each do to convert our healthy poll numbers into ACTUAL votes cast should our ONE and ONLY focus now. Polls don’t WIN elects; VOTES do. T Please help however you can. Thanks

We need a GOP that is willing to compromise to move the country forward. We don’t need a party which will obstruct every dang thing the current administration proposes. Hopefully, now that the Repubs have figured out that they failed at making President Obama a one-term President, they’ll actually do something constructive like pass the Jobs Act.

Wow, McCain was pretty honest in that particular statement. He went as far as saying that americans are a little bit hopeful now ! Isn’t he undermining the Romney/Ryan message ? Maybe he wants Romney to lose, so either Huntsman or Jeb Bush could have a chance in 2016 ?? (I remember reading that John McCain pushed Huntsman to run this year….)

Whoever picked Candy Crowley to moderate the debates needs to be punched over and over and over again. And if that person was a man, he needs to be punched hard in the nuts. HARD. I haven’t watched CNN for a long time and thank goodness. Axelrod and Governor O’Malley were the reasons I watched this morning and Maryland, you are fucking lucky to have Governor O’Malley. Crowley kept interrupting Axelrod over and over again but he got his points through. He sure did. O’Malley also did well and has the patience of a saint considering he was sitting next to GOP woman hater Roy Blunt who kept lying and lying and having his lies aided by Candy Crowley. Crowley practically crawled into McCain’s lap and almost gave him a lap dance….that’s how much she was GOP shilling.

She’s a moron. A bloody moron. An amoeba is smarter than her. Whoever picked her to moderate the debate is a fucking fool and should be punched over and over and over again.

As a current resident of MD, I feel proud to say that yes, we have a great gov, although admittedly I didn’t help to build that since I was not yet an MD resident when O’Malley got elected.

Candy Crowley deserves to be mocked, harassed and humiliated if she ever pushes that bullshyte during the debate on Wednesday. I for one will be scrutinizing her very very closely. And something tells me that I and all of us here at TOD won’t be the only ones. Candy Crowley HAS BEEN PUT ON NOTICE.

When Chris Christie first ran for Freeholder and was sued for defamation, it wasn’t his fault and he did nothing wrong.

When Chris Christie went from “not a candidate for US Attorney” to being appointed US Attorney after he was directly responsible for raising hundreds of thousands (and his brother donates hundreds of thousands) for Bush, the donations had nothing to do with it.

And when many top NJ lawyers pointed out that Christie didn’t have any experience in criminal law and his appointment was directly connected to the above hundreds of thousands in donations for Bush, that was just a coincidence.

Well up and at ’em O’s!!!!! It’s wonderful to join my TODdies on this great getting up day! I’m tuning in to the Sunday shows today, cause it’s much easier to swallow when our team is ahead. Imagine Chrispie flopping around like a beached whale trying to defend Mittwit? That can’t be fun for him. Also, with exception of a few, the moderators smell blood and they go on a feeding frenzy like the sharks they are. It doesn’t matter whose blood at this point. Not to mention, they want to be seen as shaping the winner. Expect them to be less hostile.

My political take today is Wednesday can’t get here soon enough. Wednesday is my Zumba nite, but I’m going to jiggle my wiggle for a PBO debate victory. I’m going to try and at least stay in the room. During the previous debates, I would hang in the doorway and either run away or come back into the room depending on the question and whose turn it was to answer it.

cookemom – lol going in and out of the room. I only do that for POTUS debates and when my baseball team is in the playoffs. I am afraid I am going to leave the TV off and just follow a live blogging of it – too stressful otherwise. I’m a chicken I know!!

I’m basically a chicken so yesterday’s post of Michelle Obama introducing her husband at a campaign in ’08 talking about getting over fear spoke to me. I am still nervous about the debate especially about Romney’s intent to smear our PBO saying he lies. I don’t fear PBO’s debating or explaining skills will not be up to speed. What I fear is the way the media will paint the debate results and their complicency in helping Romney by not holding him to the fire using commercial breaks to aid him and the same tactics they used in the infamous ’08 Primary Debate with George Stephanopolis and Charlie Gibbs.

It’s been a really busy week for me (fiscal year-end). I was able to join the canvass to NOVA yesterday. All I can say is that people are really engaged and from what I can see at least in Northern Virginia things are looking really good.

The campaign has a big fundraising deadline tonight. Please donate what you can and if you can’t can you please retweet my link.

Thanks and have a great productive O’Day!!!

Ashes 2 ashes, dust 2 dust, I hate 2 have 2 ask again but I must, I must. Can you donate $5 b4 the deadline 2nite? https://t.co/gzOTDChe

I like this tweet, because I am tired of people acting like, and speaking like the President is winning by default……just everyone else is being so bad. He is winning because he is so GOOD and doing things RIGHT, and he is getting his message across. People try to take credit from him all the time, and I get angry about that. He has been a good president, he has done good things, and he is a good campaigner, the best I’ve seen. No one in my memory can compare to him, certainly not Saint Ronnie. He was basically lazy, and read a script. This man understands what is going on, and is the most involved president I’ve known of.

Yes, I just had to set someone at Old Orange straight on this issue. Apart from his solid record of accomplishments during the last 3.5 years, President Obama is simply unparalleled in the campaigning department.

I also agree that President Obama has not just been lucky. He is an excellent candidate and campaigner and he has a good campaign group. They have strategized for months and because they have a plan can jump on sudden opportunities that fit their narrative.

Luck? LUCK IS OPPORTUNITY MEETING HARD WORK AND PREPARATION. Got a plaque that says that after many people told my daughter she was lucky for getting so many academic scholarships at the end of her senior year in high school. She was demoralized that people did not recognize the hard work she had put in to get straight As all through high school, for being the president of the National Honor Society, on high school and community sports teams, on the ski team, involved with her church youth group and for starting and participating in a high school tutoring group. The plaque spoke to me about her work. The words also depict President Obama’s hard work.

Successful white folks are successful because of hard work. Successful black folks are successful because of luck.
I first saw this attitude in sports — the black guy is naturally gifted, the white guy lacks the gift but makes up for it with hard work.
Why? Because black people are lazy so if they do well it HAS to be luck.
This drives me even CRAZIER than I already am.

During the Republican presidential primary debates, a telling pattern emerged. Mitt Romney, who first ran for public office back in 1994, called Rick Perry a “career politician.” Mitt Romney, who owned stock in and profited from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, criticized Newt Gingrich for working for Freddie Mac. Mitt Romney, who lobbied for funding for the Salt Lake City Olympics and has many of DC’s top Republican lobbyists intimately connected to his campaign, attacked Rick Santorum as a lobbyist. It seemed that each attack that Mitt Romney leveled at his opponents was done before they had an opportunity to say it about him.

If precedent holds, then the best way to interpret Romney’s charge that Obama will “say things that aren’t true” is that he is attempting to inoculate himself against the abundance of falsehoods he plans on espousing at the debates.

Mitt Romney’s propensity for flip-flopping long ago passed into self-parody, perfectly epitomized by his own campaign’s reference to an etch-a-sketch. But it is important to remember that his ability to say one thing one day and say the opposite the next with a straight face is rooted in his casual relationship with the truth.
.
.
As a quick refresher, here is but a small sampling of Mitt’s lies in the past, and those he is most likely to repeat.

Paul Ryan To Fox News: ‘I Don’t Have The Time’ To Explain How We Will Pay For Our Tax Plan

By Adam Peck

————————————–

Ryan has been the Republican vice presidential nominee for nearly three months, and has still not found the time to explain how a Romney administration would fund its tax plan of 20 percent deductions across the board. Perhaps that is because if he did, voters would balk at the cuts that would need to occur in programs like Medicare for the plan to remain revenue neutral.

Ryan’s refusal to talk specifics only lends further credibility to the various studies and reports that have found time to do the math. And as ThinkProgress has reported, those studies from non-partisan organizations show that the Romney/Ryan tax plan would actually result in a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans. And the only way to keep it revenue neutral is to balance their plan on the backs of middle class families, who would see a tax increase of more than $2,000.

So, NBC nightly news will be focusing on Afghanistan, and Calling it -at the Brink.
All week long, as the media I so surprised that their are Green on Blue attacks?
So surprised?
The Taliban captures these Afghan police forces, and tells them either kill Americans, or your Family dies.
And Ruchard Engle is well aware of this, he just has an agenda.
That is all!

Don’t forget today is the last day of the quarter for the various campaigns. In addition to PBO, we need to give to those downstream races in order to send PBO a Congress he can work with. I’ve decided to help out Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Joe Donnelly Indiana, Elizabeth Warren of Mass, and Joe Tester of Montana. These are close races, but there are many others. Find a few and show them some love today.

After the Romney campaign spends all week tampering down expectations of Mittwit’s debate performance, Chrispie raises the bar higher than ever. I do believe there’s sabotage afoot, that man is no friend of his Repub leader.

David Gregory is now begging David Plouffe to talk to Pres. Obama about coming on to Meet The Press. The look Plouffe gave him was priceless. Plouffe then said “well, there’s 37 days until the election. Anything’s possible.”

David Gregory is such a goof…..I will never watch his show even if the President goes on there which he won’t. David Gregory’s ratings are in the toilet and like his best friend Mitt Robme, nothing can improve his favorables…….people don’t like them.

Thanks UT. Done. And do not forget our Senate races. Just did one for one of my Senator’s friends. We need to keep the Senate solid for POB and get the help to Nancy. I also just did one for our Ms. Smashing Nancy!HZ

David Gregory is an asshole. He lied on MTP that Pres. Obama fundraised in Las Vegas the day after the attacks in Libya that killed four Americans. This NEVER happened. Twitter is on fire calling him and Meet The Press out. Journalist Jon Ralston is pissed off too and calling David Gregory out for perpetuating that GOP lie.

$2.00 $3.00 grateful for whatever. I am almost to one of my three goal.
1. Do all I can with my group in my city to phone bank, organize to go door to door.
2. Set up and meet my goal for my FR Page
3. Be first on TOD at least once.
4. GET POB/BIDEN re-elected .4More 4 -44.

Thank (((((((( Love my TOD Family)))))))) Give some goodness claps. My gut is great today. Miracles are happening. Thank you all for your beautiful thoughts. You lift my heart and spirit up so much.HZ",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Last-wish ID cards?

A Michigan lawmaker says a person's end-of-life wishes should be accessible during an emergency.

You may have what's called a ""living will"" that determines what kind of care -- if any -- you want if you have, say, a heart attack. But if you don't have that document with you, emergency responders are going to try to bring you back to life.

""Their first default is to resuscitate, and in your case, that's wrong. It's not what you wanted to do, but they didn't know that because they didn't have the document,"" says State Sen. Roger Kahn, R-Saginaw.

""When they (living wills) are not followed, you are assaulted by the medical system and then charged a bill for it.""

Kahn says state-issued ID cards that link to living wills would let emergency responders know whether you want to be resuscitated.

""You have to have legislation which says that the ambulance personnel shall search for that document, which, in my opinion, should be available by pressing a button or two.""

Kahn says such a program would spare the pain and expense of unwanted treatment.

Kahn -- who is a physician -- says many people resuscitated after suffering a heart attack outside of a hospital don't survive or have a very poor quality of life afterward.

""Statistics show that if you have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, half of the people die in the field before anybody gets there,"" Kahn says. ""Of the remaining half, another half die during CPR, which includes putting tubes in your body and breaking your ribs.

""So now there are one-quarter that are still alive. Half of them will die in the emergency room, and of the one-eighth who are now alive -- 12 percent -- half of them will die during the hospitalization. And now of the six percent alive, half of those have permanent brain damage.""

Kahn says the financial impact of using extraordinary lifesaving measures can take a big toll on families and on the state.

""We have priorities that need to be honored for the individual, and society as a whole,"" Kahn says. ""There's always a competition for the dollars to do that and for the laws that embrace our people's rights.""",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

“Many would say that a challenge course is simply an elaborate playground that affords a participant fun along with a sense of adventure. In some ways this is true, but such a statement is much too limited in what it conveys.”

For the beginning adventure education professional, Challenge Course Programming (AE 251) covers important content. After all, challenge courses are ubiquitous in our profession, and trends suggest this will continue. Simply put, they allow us to “bring the adventure to our backyard.” Their popularity has resulted, in part, from their accessibility and controllability – qualities inherent to many “artificial” adventure learning environments – both of which can yield powerful learning experiences that can be facilitated to apply to home, work or school.

This course introduces the class to the operation of a variety of low and high challenge course initiatives for adventure programming in problem solving, trust, team building, self-confidence, and communication skills. Includes belay and high ropes rescue techniques.

"BP sums up its response to Deepwater disaster

BP CEO Bob Dudley reflected on the company’s response to the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion in a keynote speech at CERAWeek in Houston, Texas, on 21 April.

He confirmed that the company had spent USD44 billion in response to the 2010 disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 crewman and caused the largest-ever oil spill in US waters. This included USD14 billion recompensing victims, a further USD 14 billion on clean-up activity, and USD 1 billion on restoration projects.

He said the company’s safety culture had since been completely changed, with “sharper oversight and additional levels of protection”. Training, he said, is now focused on best practice, and advanced technology, when approved, is used at all BP’s oil wells.

Looking forward to 2035, Dudley said he believes the oil, natural gas, and coal industries will be equally split, each sharing 27% of the global energy market. The rest would be filled by unconventional resources, such as oil shale fracking and biomass energy.

However, he said the current low oil price can be expected to continue in to the medium term, which will mean a period of massive restructuring and economic suffering for mature regions such as the North Sea, North Dakota, and parts of Texas.

As the third anniversary of the entry into force of the Maritime Labour Convention 2006 (MLC) approaches, Seafarers’ Rights International (SRI) is embarking on a comprehensive study on the effectiveness of the Convention.

Amazon’s Champions of Fire Is Back Next Month for More Mobile eSports Fun

Mobile eSports Gaming Isn’t Going Anywhere

Amazon is bringing back Champions of Fire this year, an eSports tournament focused on competitive but casual mobile games. Last year’s event was a big success for Amazon (as was Mobile Masters last month) so it isn’t too surprising to see it pop up again in 2017. This time, however, they’re going bigger.

On December 2nd and 3rd at the Time Inc.

"Slate's Blacklist of Black Conservatives

Sonny Bunch

February 23, 2010 1:09 PM

Slate's The Root -- the portion of the website where they cordon off their African-American content -- has compiled a list of ""Black folks we'd like to remove from black history."" Some of the choices are funny (Dennis Rodman) some are head-scratching (the doctor who prescribed Michael Jackson his meds?) while others are downright offensive. The continuous pathology in the liberal black community to denigrate black conservatives as ""not really black"" continues apace here: Clarence Thomas, Michael Steele, and Alan Keyes are listed alongside Idi Amin, Papa and Baby Doc Duvalier, and Robert Mugabe.

Oh, and Marion Barry. I imagine that is the excuse that the authors of the list will throw out there if questioned about including a trio of black Republicans alongside cannibals and mass murderers: ""Hey, we included a black Democrat too! He was even our very first choice!""

Of course, there's a huge difference between admitting to being embarrassed of Democrat who was caught in a FBI sting doing crack, muttered ""Bitch set me up"" as the feds burst through the door, and served time in prison as a result -- to say nothing of his myriad tax problems and, most recently, blatant corruption in D.C.'s contracting process -- and being embarrassed about the GOP entries on the list.

What is so embarrassing about Clarence Thomas -- the second black man on the Supreme Court? He would be a source of pride for the African American community, except for the fact that he's a conservative. He's a minority within a minority. One would think that mocking a minority simply for his status as such is something that writers at The Root would want to avoid.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Peanut Butter Cup Pies #apieformikey

August 13, 2011

The food blogosphere came together this week to support our own Jennifer Perillo of In Jennie’s Kitchen and her young daughters, when the shocking news of her husband’s sudden passing hit us all like a slap in the face. And we did it in the best way we know how – with food. With peanut butter pies, to be exact.

You know, I don’t know how to speak about this kind of loss – the one-minute-he’s-here-and-the-next-minute-he’s-gone kind of loss. In my life, I’ve known several and it’s never any easier, because it never makes any sense. I’ve always said that there’s not much I believe in, but I believe that everything happens for a reason, and I believe in ultimate justice. You may not see it immediately – it may take weeks, months, or even years – but you will see it. Right now, I can’t fathom any rhyme nor reason, and those words seem hollow to me.

All I can say is, I’m so sorry for your loss, Jennie. All I can do is give you a virtual hug, and hope that you can read everything I feel for you in that seemingly lame gesture.

In response to the outpouring of love and questions of “What can we do for you?” from food bloggers all over the world, Jennie wrote, “For those asking what they can do to help my healing process, make a peanut butter pie this Friday and share it with someone you love. Then hug them like there’s no tomorrow because today is the only guarantee we can count on.”

Chances are, if you Google “peanut butter pie” from here on out, you’ll have literally hundreds of choices and just as many more eloquent tributes than this one.

Peanut Butter Cup Pie

(makes about 12 mini-pies)

Ingredients:

8 oz. cream cheese (room temperature)

1/2 cup light brown sugar

3/4 cup creamy peanut butter

1/2 cup cream (light or heavy)- divided

pinch of salt

1 tsp. vanilla extract

1 large egg (room temperature)

4 oz. semi-sweet chocolate

2 Tbs. unsalted butter

Preparation:

Preheat the oven to 300º F.

In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until it’s smooth and fluffy. Add the brown sugar, then the peanut butter, 1/4 cup of the cream, salt, and vanilla, scraping down the sides of the bowl well after each addition. Last, add the egg and beat until the entire mixture is smooth. Set aside.

In a small saucepan, over low heat, melt the butter. Add the chocolate and stir until melted. Add the remaining 1/4 cup of cream, and stir until the chocolate is smooth and glossy.

Prepare a muffin pan by lining it with foil or silicone cupcake liners. If using foil liners, give each one a small shot of cooking spray.

Using a dessert spoon, place a heaping spoonful of the chocolate mixture into the bottom of each cupcake liner. Now, spoon the pie batter over the chocolate, filling each cup about 2/3 full.

Bake for 15 – 18 minutes. The batter should still jiggle just a bit when the pan is shaken. Allow the pan and pies to cool completely on a wire rack, then refrigerate for at least several hours.

When cold and firm, flip each pie over onto individual plates and unmold to serve. Allow to warm for about 10 minutes, to get a really soft creamy texture.

Too many for one sitting? After chilling, leave them in the liners, pop into a freezer storage bag, and put them in the freezer. You can thaw just the amount you need in the future!

**************

I couldn’t make my peanut butter pies for Mikey and Jennifer Perillo on Friday, because my own Mikey was having oral surgery. In deference to his sore mouth, I skipped the crust and my beloved chunky peanut butter, and resisted the temptation to garnish with chopped peanuts. I promise you – the hugs were no less fierce.

there isn't an answer that would make any sense Renee – but am grateful for this community who will surround Jennie & her girls w/as much support as she'll let us give her; it will be a long haul, but she'll make it. i am proud to be part of the community!! and those Peanut Butter Cup pies are lookin' mighty, mighty tasty!!

I heard it was over 1,000 posts…what an amazing community and a beautiful tribute to Jennie's husband. I met Jennie just a few months ago and she is such a warm and funny person. I'm so upset for her and her girls but at the same time feel warm inside because of the reaction of our community…it's an awesome one.

"What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is the world’s first digital currency and it is expanding in popularity worldwide. With the Meta Trader 4 platform you can trade this rapidly growing currency against the US Dollar 24/7. Many traders prefer to trade Bitcoin derivatives due to this asset’s highly volatile nature, which makes it ideal for CFD trading online.

Trade Cryptos Against Fiat Currencies – Unlike many exchanges out there, who are restricting their clients to trade only Crypto to Crypto, our clients can trade Cryptos against Fiat currencies (USD, EUR, JPY etc.), as well.

Bitcoin’s Rise to Prominence

Around 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto founded the first ever cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. At the time, a paper explaining its mechanics and the ideology behind it, was published through the Cryptography Mailing List.

The first Bitcoin software client was released in 2009, and Nakamoto collaborated with many other developers on the open-source team, never revealing his identity. By 2011, the enigmatic Bitcoin founder had disappeared. His peers then, understood how valuable this cryptocurrency was and worked feverishly to develop it to its maximum potential.

By October 2009, the world’s first Bitcoin exchange was established, and by November of that year 4 million Bitcoins had been ‘mined’. At the time, $1 was the equivalent of 1,309 Bitcoin – a fraction of a penny. Considering how widely Bitcoin fluctuates, that was a real steal: it hit the $10,000 mark within eight years.

How Bitcoin Became So Popular

Bitcoin was the first digital currency to be created. It is also the most respected, capitalised and traded cryptocurrency in the world. Cryptocurrency trading allows for maximum yield when it is volatile, due to its many ups and downs. This is precisely the reason global traders enjoy Bitcoin trading.

The media plays a big part in Bitcoin’s volatility. Whenever a breaking story surfaces, Bitcoin starts to fluctuate and traders have the opportunity to cash in. History has shown that Bitcoin traders and speculators routinely push this digital currency to the forefront of CFD trading.

It is increasingly being used as the preferred payment option for merchants, money transfers and trading purposes. Bitcoin enjoys widespread popularity as a financial trading instrument, despite no association with governments or central banks.

Bitcoins are mined with powerful computer hardware and software. A maximum of 21 million Bitcoin will be available, after which no further bitcoins will be produced. The algorithm which governs the production of Bitcoin limits the quantity that will be produced, and the rate at which they will be produced. It is a finite commodity – there is a fixed amount, and that ensures that greater demand will always prop up the price. In this way, it is similar to other finite commodities such as crude oil, silver, or gold.

Bitcoin in the News

November 2012 – WordPress started accepting bitcoins

July 2013 – Launching of a joint project in Kenya, linking bitcoin with M-Pesa, a popular East African mobile payments system.

September 2014 – TeraExchange, LLC, received approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission to begin listing an over-the-counter swap product based on the price of a bitcoin, marking the first time a U.S. regulatory agency approved a bitcoin financial product.

March 2016 – The Cabinet of Japan recognised virtual currencies like bitcoin as having a function similar to real money.

December 28, 2017 – Third fork in Bitcoin created: New coin on SegWit2x chain called B2X

"Loving your Job and the People You Work with (by Saskia Tjepkema)

As the Dutch IT firm Schuberg Philis grew, it started to become more of an “organization.” In his keynote address Thurday, information manager Ilja Heitlager explains: “Without realising it, we created departments and hierarchy, inadvertently alienating our experts from our customer. Our people are very skilled and focused, but they were lost. In times of crisis, however, for instance if a machine broke down, multidisciplinary teams were created, with experts in the front. And the whole energy changed.”

Schuberg Philis decided to make this interdisciplinary approach their way of working all the time. They linked their experts closer to the customer, by making them fully responsible for their systems. “Our people are not running an IT machine, they are running a bank,” says Ilja. “If the machine breaks down, people can’t draw money, and they know it”.

The conversations changed. “If people are responsible for the system, and something happens, they don’t talk about the past (‘what happened’, ‘what went wrong’, ‘why did it break down?’) or about others (‘they should just…’),” says Ilja. “Instead, they talk about the future and about themselves (‘how do we solve it’, ‘how can we get the bank up and running?’).” At Schuberg Philis they call this this cupfighter mentality.

Another thing that happened is that people built more personal relations with customers. Ilja tells of finding phone numbers of the company’s engineers scribbled on whiteboards in customers’ offices. “They know whom to call, instead of just having to rely on an anonymous 0800 number.”

This year, the company decided to take this way of working to the next level. While the company used to work with chain-optimizing methods such as the theory of constraints and looking for the weakest link, this always drained the energy from the room. “I wanted to talk about: what makes people get up in the morning? What do they bring to work?” says Ilja.

With David Cooperrider the company organised a three-day Appreciative Inquiry (AI) summit, with over 200 people. Employees as well as clients, family and friends joined. “That summit ended in 16 projects. But that is not the main thing. The main thing is that it gave us 117 people the same energy and a level of affection for each other, their work and our environment, that is stronger than before. And that is what fuels our company right now, making work more meaningful and bringing our company to the next level.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Ways To Allow You To Vend Your Real Estate To The Real Estate Investing Ornaization

The property investment is gaining popularity by the day. A lot of investors are now getting into the business of building the real estate and selling them. The society prefer to buy the already made house rather than buying and starting the construction project. An increase of the selling of the real estate is making the practice challenging even to the agencies. The supply is superseding the demand.

It is difficult to sell a house unless you have the criteria to be in a position to sell it with no time. Involving the realtors is not a perfect solution either. This is because most home buyers like to go directly to the owner of the home instead of following the agency. It is because people are familiar with the lies in the real estate today. The best trick nowadays is to sell the home yourself because you are likely going to sell the home faster and again you will avoid the charges that the agencies would charge you. It is possible to sell your property at an affordable cost to draw the attention of several buyers to open the doors of selling the property quick. Discussed in the article are the things that can enable you to sell your real estate quick and make a lot of profit.

It is not possible to change the location of your property. But making it possible for the real estate investment company to access your property is the best thing you can do. You can do this by making the road to your home passable and comfortable for them to get in there. On the same, you need to make sure you improve the way in a way that it can take them a short duration to access the main roads and the shops form your property. It is a good way to create some competition among several real estate agencies.

Pricing the home right is another important aspect you need to consider. It is because there is no buyer who can enter into a deal over an overrated home.

The first impression of by the customers of the home is very crucial. You need to make your home look good by keeping the grass short, make the lawns to look beautiful or you can even plant new flowers and do some painting.
Still, you need to involve some marketing agents such as the close friends when you need to sell your property fats and at a profit. You can as well post photos online.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"i remember saying last year at draft time that the reason it would be smart to slightly reach for Tannehill at pick #8 was because if he returned to A&M for his senior year he would be the #1 pick in the 2013 draft and more than likely out of our reach. And that's what draft analysts are saying now. That this draft is weak at quarterback and that Ryan would have graded out much higher than Geno Smith or Matt Barkley......and that Tannehill would be headed to the Chiefs with the top pick in April.

I feel great knowing that, like we're ahead of the curve and instead of having to blow a pick on a signal caller this year and then wait til he grows as a rookie again.....thats process is all over now and we can spend all of our picks at positions that make quicker impacts in the NFL. And now we build around our franchise QB.

That was a smart move last year by Ireland and it sets him up in good shape this offseason.

Re: if Tannehill had stayed in school, he'd be going #1 in April

You're assuming he would've played lights out.

Anything can happen. Look what happened to Barkley's draft stock this year.

Re: if Tannehill had stayed in school, he'd be going #1 in April

Even if he didn't play lights out he'd still be the top quarterback and that's what the Chiefs are going to take at #1. Geno Smith and Barkley didn't play lights out this year. And Tannehill has better combine measurables, bigger arm, better pocket presence, can make more pro throws than either.

Smith is not the best player in the 2013 NFL Draft. We have him rated as the 16th best prospect overall. But it won't be a surprise for the Chiefs to use the top pick on him because of how desperately they need a starting quarterback. Of course if Kansas City reloads its front office, the Chiefs could go after a veteran free agent. Or fall in love with another quarterback in the draft. It's also true that Smith faded toward the end of the season, but he still has good talent. To really secure a top five draft position, Smith should participate in the Senior Bowl. His combine measurables will also be important – namely his hand size after he had issues holding the ball in the Pinstripe Bowl.

Measureables or not, if he had a so-so season or sub-par one he would not be a guaranteed top pick in the draft. Guys can play themselves out of that slot.

Not necessarily. Just look at a guy like Jake Locker. He played aweful his senior year. But he was still drafted top ten because of how well he played his junior year and because he had rare athletic ability.

With every prospect it all boils down to their skillset and ability. Production is a big part of where guys get picked, but often times good players are on bad teams, so you wind up having to evaluate guys more based on their skillset.

Just look at a guy like Jake Cutler. The guy only won 11 games his entire college career. His numbers were very mediocre by college standards. But he was a 1st round pick because of his skillset.

I'm not saying production doesn't play a part, but based on Tannehill's growth in such a short period of time, one could reasonably believe that he was primed to improve and have a good season. All indicators were saying that this was a kid on his way up.

But this is all irrelevant because Tannehill and Sherman are attached at the hip and there was no way Tannehill was going to stick around in a transitional year and risk his draft status. All of these guys talk to evaluators. Once Tannehill found out he'd be a 1st round pick, it was an easy decision I'm sure.

Jake Locker didn't go #1 in the draft.

Got anything else for me? I mean by your logic Michael Egnew should've gone higher than the 3rd round based on his junior year. He was an All-Big 12 and concensus 1st team All-American.

Lets say Tannehill sucked it up like Barkley did or got injured. He might not be #1 overall & if he was it would be by default. I am not sure I am getting this thread. Is this another attempt to justify another losing season by implying that we got a steal at #8 because he might be the #1 in the draft the following year. I mean why not just imply that he is by far head & shoulders better than the 2 Quarterbacks taken ahead of him in his draft year. Taking him at #8 was not a reach , we needed a QB & he had ties to our staff & he was there at 8. Had he not been taken at 8 , Ireland would have had his ""acorns"" tied & bound by most Dolphin fans. Look most of us here like the guy but this pedestal thing is getting out of hand. Lets see where we are at in 2 years. Why not start a thread on how he should be rookie of the year.

_________________2015. Jets & Bills new regimes & no QB. Pats , nowhere to go but down. We come back with best young QB in the game plus we keep the best regime intact. Making of dynasty.

Re: if Tannehill had stayed in school, he'd be going #1 in April

Luck for all the good he did...Has some things to cleanup himself...

His qb rating is right there with Tanny 76.5 to 76.1. His comp.% is 54 which was the lowest in the league(Lower than Sanchize) and he had 18 picks...Surrounded by a heck of alot more talent than Tannehill and going into an established system.

Anyway i think i heard Tannehill would'nt have been taken until the second round if not for those guys staying in school.

He's not worthy

He has delivered, and if you look at his progress this year there is no reason to think that he would not be the overall #1 pick in the draft this year. He would have had a very good senior year at Texas A&M.

No question had Tannehill stayed at A & M and if he was again the starter (Manziel as a freshman would have been on the bench) he would have grown even more as a QB heading into the NFL.

Tannehill in my opinion was still very green as a QB and the Dolphins knew that and he still started and played his rookie year. Next season is a year that I am really hoping bigger things from the kid.

Give him some more line protection and more offensive weapons too. There is good reason for us fans to be more excited than in years past at the QB spot.

I agree with the naysayers. I don't think that is a reasonable assumption. He could have gotten hurt or not done well under a different HC. Being the #1 pick isn't easy to earn.

Re: if Tannehill had stayed in school, he'd be going #1 in April

Wasn't Barkley considered the better prospect last year before he decided to return to USC?

Outside of Barkley's intangibles, I can agree that Tannehill probably is the most talented QB versus this year's prospects. But the thread topic is a pretty wild assumption.

Give him this much credit though...he had what would normally be considered a good rookie year on a team that wasn't built too well. No one thought he was ready to start and he ended up being much better than most expected. He has a lot of things to work on but has shown enough upside and flashes for us to think that he can be a good starter for a long time.

Not necessarily. Just look at a guy like Jake Locker. He played aweful his senior year. But he was still drafted top ten because of how well he played his junior year and because he had rare athletic ability.

With every prospect it all boils down to their skillset and ability. Production is a big part of where guys get picked, but often times good players are on bad teams, so you wind up having to evaluate guys more based on their skillset.

Just look at a guy like Jake Cutler. The guy only won 11 games his entire college career. His numbers were very mediocre by college standards. But he was a 1st round pick because of his skillset.

I'm not saying production doesn't play a part, but based on Tannehill's growth in such a short period of time, one could reasonably believe that he was primed to improve and have a good season. All indicators were saying that this was a kid on his way up.

But this is all irrelevant because Tannehill and Sherman are attached at the hip and there was no way Tannehill was going to stick around in a transitional year and risk his draft status. All of these guys talk to evaluators. Once Tannehill found out he'd be a 1st round pick, it was an easy decision I'm sure.

Jake Locker didn't go #1 in the draft.

Got anything else for me? I mean by your logic Michael Egnew should've gone higher than the 3rd round based on his junior year. He was an All-Big 12 and concensus 1st team All-American.

A quarterback doesn't go 1st overall every year. The writer of this article was simply pointing out that with the need for quarterbacks at the top end of the draft, there is a good chance that Tannehill could have potentially gone 1st overall had he improved off of his junior season.

As far as Egnew, he fell for a reason. Low wonderlic score and he probably tested out poorly on the chalkboard. The guy has the physical ability, he just lacks the mental side of things.

Drone War Picks Up Again in Pakistan

According to reports, three separate drone attacks in Pakistan’s South Waziristan mountains killed at least 17 people Tuesday. The AP reported that eight suspected militants were among the dead in a separate strike in North Waziristan today.

The attacks are the latest in a string of strikes since the new year began. The holiday period also saw a number of drone attacks launched against militants in Yemen after a comparatively quiet period.

Meanwhile, criticism of the U.S.’s drone wars remains fierce at home and abroad. A new study by one of President Obama’s former security advisers deemed the drone program counterproductive, “encouraging a new arms race that will empower current and future rivals and lay the foundations for an international system that is increasingly violent,” the Guardian noted Tuesday.

Michael Boyle, who was on Obama’s counterterrorism group in the run-up to the president’s election in 2008, said the U.S. administration’s growing reliance on drone technology was having “adverse strategic effects that have not been properly weighed against the tactical gains associated with killing terrorists.”

Civilian casualties were likely to be far higher than had been acknowledged, he said.

Reports estimate that the CIA and the military have killed about 2,500 people with drone attacks. A report by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism stated that under the Obama administration between 2008 and 2011 drone strikes killed between 282 and 535 civilians, including 60 children. The number of civilian drone deaths up until now is a subject of upcoming U.N. investigations.

Critics of U.S. drone attacks have raised concerns about the nomination of John Brennan as CIA director. Brennan, Obama’s chief counterterrorism adviser, is considered a key architect of the drone program and the creeping militarization of CIA activity.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Archives for April 2012

One of the great joys of our friendship comes from sharing our holidays. For many years we have been lucky enough to celebrate both the Jewish traditions with Rhona’s family and the Italian traditions with Joan’s family. As Passover and Easter rapidly approach (and they fall on the same weekend this year) we find ourselves in heavy planning mode — making lists, shopping, cooking, but also dreaming and remembering. So many of our family celebrations are based on those we remember from our own childhoods, traditions we hope to pass on to the next generation. So we drag out the old faded recipes, tablecloths, photos… and the stories come rushing back. Today we share with you a few sample menus and iconic dishes from our diverse backgrounds, using the fresh ingredients available to us in the Santa Barbara markets. We know you will recognize some of these recipes, and perhaps find some inspiration for your own celebrations in a few of our ideas. As for us, we will sit down at the Seder table together on Friday and then hunt for Easter eggs together on Sunday… our families will share the holidays once again and we will revel in the commonality of our experience as well as the diversity of our traditions. Wishing you all a beautiful holiday weekend spent with loved ones and filled with joy.

Rhona’s Passover Seder

For me, the holiday is all about family and tradition. As I peel the potatoes, slice the onions, braise the brisket, simmer the carrots, update our family Haggadah (the book that guides our telling of the Passover story), set the table, light the candles, I think about all of the Seders that have taken place all over the world for so many centuries. All the dishes we put on the table on the first night of Passover represent a link to a very old story, but also a timeless one, of freedom, of family, of appreciation for what we have been given. My niece recently made me aware of a poem called “A Passover Love Story,” which reminds us that all the thought that goes into this one meal, the endless details: the Seder plates, the many courses, the recitation of the story, grandma’s silver, mom’s linens, granny’s candlesticks, and the memories: the voices of my grandfather and my father in my head as they read the Hebrew in the Maxwell House Haggadah, the laughter of our children as they searched for the hidden “afikomen,” the Manischewitz wine – all of it is a sort of unspoken code for the passing of tradition from one generation to the next. So here is my partial menu, along with my mother’s recipe for matzo ball soup, an important part of that code, and the symbol of everything Jewish that can heal whatever ails us!

There are as many ways to make matzo balls as there are Jewish grandmothers, each recipe claiming to be the best, the fluffiest, the lightest, the densest... it's all according, as my own grandmother used to say. It's what you're used to. For my family, we've gone the route of light and tender, easy on the salt.

Ingredients

3 jumbo eggs, separated, yolks beaten

3 tablespoons chicken fat or shortening

3 tablespoons cold water or sparkling water

⅔ cup matzo meal

½ teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon chopped fresh dill (optional)

1 large onion, chopped (optional)

1 tablespoon vegetable oil (optional)

Instructions

If using the onion, cook in a heavy skillet in vegetable oil over medium heat until softened, then lower heat and continue cooking until well-browned and fragrant. Be careful not to burn it. In a bowl, combine the egg yolks, chicken fat, water, matzo meal, dill if using, and salt. In an electric mixer, whip the egg whites, then fold it gently into the yolk mixture. If using the onion, add it to the mixture now and combine well. Chill in refrigerator six hours or in freezer one hour.

Put a pot of water up to boil. Using a tablespoon measure, scoop and shape by hand into 2"" balls, being careful not to over-handle the mix. Drop each ball into the boiling water, cover and cook for at least 30 minutes. Ladle one or two in each person's bowl and cover with your own hot chicken soup or broth. (If you need a basic recipe for the soup, think about simmering a whole chicken in a big pot of water, adding chunks of carrots, onions, celery, parsnips, dill, and parsley. Bring it to a boil and then cook it over a low flame for about an hour before straining out the broth and letting it sit overnight in the refrigerator. The fat will rise to the top so you can scoop it out and discard it. Then just re-heat your clear broth when you're ready to serve it.)

Joan’s Sicilian Easter Breakfast

As children, my sisters and I couldn’t wait for Easter morning – the end of Lent lifting the ban on eating candy, the Easter baskets somehow magically appearing on our beds, and the Easter eggs we colored the day before, now hiding in the house awaiting our discovery. Our hunts took place first thing in the morning because they were needed for Easter breakfast. Our father always helped out the sister with the least eggs, urging her on with, “You’re getting warmer. You’re getting colder.” I’m not sure who had more fun, the three of us rushing around to collect the most eggs or our parents watching our fervent efforts as we upended upholstery, crawled under tables and rummaged through kitchen drawers. When all the eggs were accounted for, we sat down to an amazing breakfast. Along with the newly rescued eggs, our Easter table consisted of an assortment of Italian salami, cheeses and crusty rolls purchased at the local Italian deli. The Easter table would not be complete without our father’s cured black olives. But the star of our Easter table had to be our mother’s Italian Easter Bread. Yes, the braided bread, shaped like a wreath with brightly decorated eggs nestled inside. We adored this festive bread as children. Our mother continued to make this bread for her grandchildren, using the eggs they colored. Her grandchildren were equally delighted. This bread is sure to enchant children of any age and when my daughters are home we love making the bread together and remembering Grandma Julie and her fabulous bread. Here’s our breakfast menu and my mother’s Italian Easter bread recipe.

In a large mixing bowl, blend the sugar, salt, and yeast and 1 cup of flour; stir well.

In a small saucepan, combine milk and butter, heating slowly until the milk is warm and the butter is melted. Gradually add the milk and butter to the flour mixture, stirring constantly. Add the two eggs and ½ cup flour and beat well. Add the remaining flour, ½ cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When the dough draws away from the bowl, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. If the dough is sticky, add more flour in small amounts. Lightly oil a large bowl, and place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured board. Divide the dough in half. Carefully roll each piece into a 24-inch rope. Loosely braid the two ropes together and form it into a ring on a greased baking sheet. Pinch the ends together to seal. Gently open the braid slightly to make a place for each colored egg. Carefully push the eggs down into the dough as far as possible. Cover the bread with waxed paper and let rise in a warm, draft-free place until double in bulk, about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Beat water and egg together and gently brush the mixture over the dough with a pastry brush. Bake the bread in a preheated 350 degrees oven for about 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the bread comes out clean. Place onto a wire rack to cool. Once the bread is cool, drizzle the icing on top between the eggs, and decorate with colored sprinkles.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Not commenting on how good good he played as I doubt I’ll change your mind but he started the move that lead to Fletch being one on one with a neat pass on to Reach and he started the move that first got Baker in space down the right with a smart pass round the defender to put Reach in space. Don’t know if you’ve forgotten these or choosing to ignore them.

The injury wasn’t made up. Even KW admitted he’d missed a training session due to a knock in his twitter post. The disagreement was over the severity of it, KW felt he was fine to carry on, I imagine (but don’t know) JL probably agreed but saw it as a useful reason for not including him.

This deal could have an impact on us. If Chelsea don’t go for Butland (they were evens with the bookies as his new club) then I don’t know who will. If no one goes for butland then Stoke aren’t going to come in for Westwood.

My understanding was that the good doctor him indoors couldn’t get his money out of China to bankroll Villa hence the hmrc issues. Nw people came in and paid up all the tax issues etc. However they have no idea embargo yet. Next season they will do so they’re going all out for promotion again this year. May well be miles over he limits if hey miss out.

Agreed. What I would say about that is that DC and Katrien were in constant dialogue with EFL during the meeting in an attempt to come to an agreement that will allow us to sign players. Probably not before Thursday but loans before end of August. From why they said yesterday I’m confident that all are aware that Rb remains a weakness. If we get everything sorted hopefully we will get our replacement in. Unfortunately we are not in a position to get players in before selling others.

I understand you point and like you say people have their own views.
I think the club view is that £50k (if that is correct I’ve not seen a figure before) this season doesn’t cover much for a multimillion pound company. It also leaves us open to a continually decreasing figure, next time the Beeb might offer £40k then £30k etc. Whereas this season we might get 2000 more customers. Next season we might get 2000 more etc (figures plucked from my head to illustrate point). Eventually we will be in a much stronger position.
It’s one of those odd things with our club at the moment where people are worrying about the immediate success and the future success. I think this is a decision that has been made to strengthen the future of the club. I guess the club felt that becuse this was over a relatively small fee (in the grand scheme of things) they could afford to take a stand.
I do however agree that we will surely be worse off this season.

Help with accessing. Not purchasing for them. We have enough money trouble as it is. Lol
They know it won’t be popular with all. Only 92% have access to the internet (I believe this was the figure shared yesterday.) however they can offer those 92% a better service which won’t be interrupted to spend 5 minutes talking about pigs, mini pigs and dingles. (Best reaction of the night came when 99% of fans in attendance were in uproar after a fan suggested owls fans prefer to listen to the radio because we want to hear the games of the pigs,mini pigs and dingles as well as our updates. )
As as they admitted last night nobody wants to pay for something that was once free however they will be able to offer a better product to fans this way. One that is uninterrupted by rivals. A good point that I hadn’t given much thought before last night was that old fans who can no longer attend games will now be able to listen to all Wednesday games instead of just some away games.
You’re right in the sense that if we want positive PR we should suck up to the Beeb and accept whatever they offer us. We have taken a riskier and bolder strategy but one that may pay off in the long run. I can definitely see more clubs following us in the future.

Absolutely. It was Carlos that wanted Rhodes DC wasn’t sure but backed CC. Reference to fans was only that they all wanted him when he signed but changed their mind later. When DC talks, he talks a lot so I’m not saying it is intentional misleading from anyone but he didn’t buy him for the fans he bought him for Carlos. He spoke about this at the January meeting and was probably more clear about it then.
Selling Hunt was a decision by the club. Mention of fans was only to say that they had had a drastic change of view since his departure.
I agree about transfer fees. I think DC is eager not to be taken advantage of but we’re clearly in a weak bargaining position. Hopefully they get as good a deal as possible. At least it will be his wages off the books. And long term will help increase the ability (&value) of the youngsters which is positive.

Memberships- won’t change, wouldn’t be fair on those who have already purchased. I do imagine however it will change back to £50 deal next year.
Radio- we won’t be letting the BBC bully us. Explained last night that most fans do have access to internet and the club are willing to support people who have difficulty accessing the service. Also spoke about wanting to offer a free trial month but need the efl to grant us permission first.

Really hate the term ‘fake news’. Really, really hate it. Please don’t make me start talking like trump.
Thats not true. He repeated last night what he said in January at the meeting then. Carlos wanted Rhodes. DC wasn’t convinced we needed him but trusted Carlos’ views and backed him financially. All he said about fans was that they all thought it was great business at the time. Everyone wanted Rhodes when we signed him and now they all point at it as terrible business. Hindsight.
With Hunt he said that fans were critical of Hunt last season. Many said he (and Palmer) weren’t good enough yet as soon as he’s sold people talk about him like he’s amazing. He never said he was influenced into selling Jack Hunt only that there seemed a drastic change in opinion of Hunt before and after the sale.
Your two posts seem to contradict each other. Are you worried we’re trying to get too much or not trying to get enough?
DC made no mention of specific fees (or which players) that have been offered but I don’t think anyone would expect him to disclose that sort of information while talks are on going.

Okay, so nothing specific about transfers just a general negativity?
DC spoke quite extensively about not giving things away for less than they’re worth (Not transfers but sponsorship, radio commentary rights etc). Nothing about the meeting made me think we’d be weak negotiators. They didn’t talk specifics but admitted they received really low bids for players from clubs thinking they could take advantage of us. DC having none of it. Hopefully that continues.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

TUNA TRACKING

WHAT IS TUNA TRACKING?
This is not an introduction to working trials type tracking. It is a scent Mind Game that pet dogs can have fun doing together with their handlers
by following strange but exciting scent trails (eg the scent from the juices of tinned fish) that have been laid either by their handler or a helper. The dog is attached to a long line on its
harness and then the handler and dog silently search and follow the trail until the dog finds the ""jackpot"" (eg. tiny flakes of either tuna,
salmon, sardines, or pilchards) that were left at the end of the trail.

Tuna Tracking helps handlers develop their dog's sense of smell, a sense that is often ignored. A dog of any age or breed will really enjoy
doing this nose work exercise as it fulfills their hunting and scavenging instincts. It leaves the dog mentally tired but satisfied from working
for a reward while not being over excited or stressed. Many handlers have commented that although they walk their dogs for long periods of time the
dogs never seems to tire, yet this type of exercise (ie mental stimulation) leaves their dog mentally and physically replete after ""following"" just one or two relatively short Tuna Tracks.

Obviously take into account the age of your dog when doing this Mind Game and do not expect too much from a young dog as they are only able to concentrate for a very short time (even 2 or 3
seconds can seem like minutes to a young puppy!). Also, some breeds of dog are purposely bred to have low levels of concentration - such as flushing
dogs like Springer Spaniels - as they must run and ""quarter"" the undergrowth to flush out any game that may be hiding, rather than follow a particular track or scent of one bird or animal.

WARNING Do not play this or any other type of ""find the food"" game in countries where poisoned food is routinely left to kill stray dogs. This is a very big problem in countries such as
Greece, where too many pet dogs die in terrible agony from eating baited food left either by the authorities or people who regard dogs as a nuisance and vermin.

WHAT DO I NEED?

A friend or family member who will help you lay the tracks. However, it is possible for a handler to do Tuna Tracking by themselves (see Dog Management below). This track layer will need to
carry -

Soggy/wet strong smelling food (eg. tuna, salmon, pilchards, or sardines etc - one or two types is sufficient) kept in separate airtight containers (eg. see Treat Boxes) so that the dog cannot detect the scent of the food as you travel to the venue.

One leg of an old pair of tights for each variety of food you will be using.

Small airtight box to put the tights leg in after laying the track. This stops the dog air scenting the smelly tights after the track has been
laid and the person who laid it accidentally stands upwind of the dog.

Rubber gloves or hand wipes to clean the hands of the person who is laying the track and squeezing the ""tuna"" in & out of the tights.

Between 2-6 easily visible poles/stakes (one with a strip of plastic cut out of a plastic carrier bag, to flutter in the wind so that you can see the wind's direction). These poles will be used
to mark the start and finish of each track that you lay in the session, enabling you not to lay one track too close to another.

The handler will need -

A cotton tracking line of approximately 20-30 feet (6-9 metres) to enable the handler to control the Game and prevent the dog just running around in a haphazard fashion. You can make your own
tracking line by using a cotton washing line, or a piece of cotton rope, for medium to large dogs; and thinner cord for smaller dogs. Tie a quick release clip from an old lead at one end, and make a
loop at the other end to use as a handle. Do not use synthetic type rope or line (eg. nylon) as it is likely to burn your hands as the dog pulls the line over your fingers.
Although the length of this line seems excessive and cumbersome there is a purpose for it -
- The length of line that is dragging along behind you and the dog indicates where you have just been walking.
- While the 10ft or so between you and your dog prevents you from going too close to the dog and accidentally polluting the air and ground as it assesses the scent in front of it.

A comfortable and well fitting harness to attach the clip on the tracking line. Please don't try to track with a line on a dog's collar (see
Why Dogs Pull on a Lead).

WHERE & WHEN CAN IT BE DONE?
Chose your Tuna Tracking venue carefully. Try to find a place where you and your dog will not be distracted by people or the sudden appearance of a loose dog joining in the tracking. For instance,
try and find an out-of-the-way spot where you usually walk your dog (local parks usually stipulate that all dogs must be kept on leads, which of course your dog will be as it will either be on its
lead or the tracking line), areas of the countryside open to the public, or a field that the farmer has given you permission to use, etc.

In the early stages of teaching your dog to follow a Tuna Track, PLEASEDO NOT LAY TRACKS -

In very long grass, through undergrowth, or through fallen leaves as the scent can be dispersed and lost in such rough and rugged terrain. Ankle high grass is ideal tracking terrain.

Over, beside, or along a footpath, as the scents of other dogs or humans may be too strong or distracting for your dog's nose.

In grassy areas that have just been mown. The scent from the recently cut grass is very strong and may overpower the scent of the ""tuna"".

On recently turned earth - once again the overpowering scent will make Tuna Tracking very difficult.

Across fields of stubble after crops have been harvested. Straw stalks that have been cut can be very sharp and hurt a dog's nose as it follows a track across a field of straw stubble.

When the wind is very strong or gusting. Be aware of the wind's direction (however light) by either looking at the strip of plastic on the pole, or tossing some blades of grass in the air to see
which direction they travel in the wind. Don't ask your dog to track in very windy weather at these early stages. If there is any wind at all, lay the first couple of tracks with the wind blowing
directly towards the track layer (and eventually the dog). Once the dog has learnt the concept of tracking you can make it more of a challenge by laying the track with the wind behind you so that the
dog cannot ""air scent"" the tuna but must follow the trail along the ground. Tracking with the
wind blowing across a trail is very difficult but can be mastered by a dog if it is very determined.

Some of the above can be introduced later on in your dog's training, when it is confident as has plenty of experience. But even then introduce each new challenge one at a time.

Don't give your dog a large meal before it has done the tracking. Dogs need to feel farily hungry in order to really appreciate the prize of the ""treasure"" when they eventually find it at the end
of a track.

Also do not take your dog for its normal walk before you do the tracking - your dog needs to be fresh and keen, not overexcited by too much exercise beforehand. The tracking will soon tire the dog
out mentally and physically from concentrating on the tracks and it will sleep for hours afterwards!

DOG MANAGEMENT
When you arrive at the venue where you want to lay a Tuna Track, do not be tempted to tie your dog up while you lay a track - the dog will become frustrated, overexcited and stressed having to watch you prepare and lay the track and will be unable to concentrate or do the Game properly when it is eventually allowed to do the
track.

We strongly recommend that you leave your dog in a safe place where it cannot see or smell what you are doing and can relax until you are ready to begin the track - ideally we recommend that you
leave your dog in its well ventilated car.

Alternatively, if there are two of you doing Tuna Tracking, get the helper to lay the track while the handler takes the dog in the opposite direction, out of sight and smell of where the track is
being laid. Bring the dog to the start of the track when the helper has finished laying the track and has walked in a wide curve away from the track (and downwind from it) back to the start.

LAYING THE TRACKClick here to print off diagrams (to be edited) of how to lay the first and second sessions of tuna tracking.

Squeezing the ""wet"" tuna to
the end of the leg of the tights

Dragging the tuna in the
tights along the ground

Emptying the tuna on the
ground at the end of the track

After choosing the most suitable area on which to lay the tracks, and having worked out which way the wind (if any) is blowing, the track layer stands facing into the wind and places the first
marker pole in the ground.

Standing beside this first marker pole, take a small handful of the wet and soggy tuna and place it inside the toe part of the leg of the tights.

Squeeze the tuna right to the end so that the juices begin to seep through the toe and fall on the ground beside the post. This strong ""start"" helps the dog to find the scent and then follow the
trail when it is brought to the pole to begin tracking.

Stand facing into the wind (or with the wind behind you when the dog is more experienced at Tuna Tracking) and pick out a specific tree, bush, fence post, or any other landmark which you can use
as a ""focal point"". You will use this focus point to walk towards while you lay the track so that you walk in a straight line into the wind, rather than veer off to one side and make the track more
difficult for the dog to follow.

Pick up the second marker pole (which will be used to mark the end of the Tuna Track) and drag the tights along the ground behind you as you walk towards the focus point.

Make sure that the toe of the tights is touching the ground all the time as you walk - do not allow it to ""bunny hop"" as this does not leave a continuous track for the dog to follow.

Keep focusing your attention on the ""focus point"" as you walk along laying the track.

Try to count and remember how many steps you are taking so that you have some idea of how long the track is going to be. Do not lay too long a track to begin with - 5 or 6 paces is quite
sufficient for a first track. The reason why we recommend that short tracks be used in the early stages of Tuna Tracking is that many dogs do not have the mental stamina to concentrate for long
periods of time when they start playing this Game. However, as the dog's enthusiasm and ability increases in subsequent training sessions the length of the tracks (and even 90 degree turns) can be
increased and added to develop the dog's powers of concentration.

When you have taken 5 or 6 paces empty the tuna from the leg of the tights on to the ground. Try to sprinkle the flakes in a 1-2ft (30-60cm) square area rather than leave a pile of it in one spot
- the dog will then enjoy searching the area for every last morsel of the tinned fish when it comes to the end of the Tuna Track.

Take one or two more paces after the end of the track and place the ""finish"" marker pole in the ground. We recommend that this marker pole should not be left close to or beside the tuna because
some dogs catch on to the fact that this pole is where the tuna will be left and run directly to the pole rather than use their noses to follow the scent trail - cheats!

Put the smelly tights in a sealed container - see ""What do I Need"" above.

Do not walk back down the Tuna Track that you have just laid. You will disturb the track and also pick up scent molecules on your footwear that will leave another, more confusing, track for your
dog. Instead, walk away from the finish marker pole at a 90 degree angle so that your scent does not accidentally blow across the Tuna Track. Make a real effort to do a wide curve until you are
standing well out of the way from where the dog is going to be tracking. On the second and subsequent track laying, make sure you walk over ground that had already been used rather than ""pollute""
ground that you will soon be laying a track on.

It is possible to lay all the tracks for the training session (ie. two or three tracks) before getting the dog and actually tracking. However, be wary of the wind blowing the scent of track 2
& 3 onto track 1 & 2 and distracting the dog while it is working these tracks.

FOLLOWING THE TRACK

14. Once the track layer is well away from the tracking area the dog can be brought to the start pole and have its tracking line attached to the harness. Give your tracking signal/command (I say
""track"" and point to the ground) and encourage it to sniff the ground where the tuna juices were left.

15. Be patient and do not hurry your dog! Just because you can see where the track has been laid (by looking at the marker poles) your dog does not understand what is expected of
it. Let it enjoy having a really good sniff at this unusual and exciting scent it has just found - after all it is concentrating and using its nose already so the tracking session is working even if
it doesn't find the ""end"" straight away.

16. Eventually your dog will discover that there is more of this exciting scent going in one direction (ie. the track that has been laid)

17. Allow the tracking line to run through your fingers as the dog begins to follow the track (ie. it is walking in line with the start and finish marker poles) and silently follow your dog,
feeding your way up the line to keep it taut yet without pulling against it. Let the line drag behind you so that you can either work your way up or down it without distracting the dog while it is
working. The dog should not feel you pulling on the tracking line, but you must not let the line become too slack either.

18. Do not talk or distract your dog (apart from praising it when it reaches the end of the track) - be patient and enjoy watching its body language as it concentrates on assessing the scents on
the ground or in the air. It is fascinating to watch and learn how a dog's body language changes as it focuses and concentrates on using its amazing sense of smell. Often the dog's muscles will
tighten, and their tail carriage and ear positions will change. Later on you may recognise these ""concentration"" signals when working your dog in other training situations and realise how hard your
dog is trying to work for you.

19. Because you have the two marker poles to indicate where the track is, you can tell when the dog is veering off to the right or left of the track. If this occurs, tighten your grip on the line
so that the dog cannot venture any further away from the track, stand perfectly still and silent and wait for the dog to wander back towards the track and pick up the track again. Then allow the line
to run freely again and continue to walk behind the dog, gradually taking in any slack in the line as you walk up it.

Veering to the left

Veering to the right

Veering back on track

20. Eventually your dog will come to the end of the track and begin to find the flakes of tuna on the ground and start to eat them. Only then can you calmly and quietly praise your dog for being so clever and finding such an exciting and tasty a reward. Remember this is the highlight of the exercise for the dog - don't be
in a hurry to call the dog away from the exciting ""treasure"". Let it take as long as it wants to double and triple check that every tiny molecule of tuna has been completely found and eaten - after
all the whole tracking session will only take a few minutes so allow the dog the opportunity to have as long as it needs at the end of the track.

""Cor! What's this!!""

The handler has just as much fun
as the dog when Tuna Tracking

21. Once the dog has lost interest in the end of the track you can walk away from the finish marker pole at 90 degrees, just as the track layer did. Do a large curve back to the beginning of the
first track and then walk towards the second track's marker pole and repeat steps 14 - 20.

22. If the dog is beginning to look tired and is losing concentration, do not ask it to do another track - take it back to the car to rest. If, however, after a third track the dog still looks
keen to do more, make a mental note of the fact and lay longer tracks the next time you do Tuna Tracking.

23. Once the dog has finished the tracking session take it back to the car and allow it to rest there, and also rest at home when you return. You will find that your dog will be mentally exhausted
from choosing to concentrate so hard and for so long, and it will fall into a healthy and very deep sleep. When it eventually wakes it will be calm and fulfilled from doing a ""proper
day's work"".

24. As the dog's levels of concentration and ability to track improves, lengthen the tracks. Experiment to see what happens when the wind is blowing from behind the dog rather than into its face
when Tuna Tracking. Also, you can experiment to try different locations, ground and weather conditions, and also introduce the dog to tracks that veer off at right angles etc. However, do not
overface the dog by asking too much or too soon. Allow the dog to enjoy this Game at whatever level it feels happiest with.

25. Play Tuna Tracking at most once a fortnight. Too much of a good thing can make dog and handler complacent.

SUMMARY
Only lay short tracks when starting to teach your dog to track. Dogs need practice to build up the amount of time that they can concentrate following a trail. Your first training session will give
you some idea of how long your dog can follow a trail. Begin at this level and gradually increase the length of the trail as your dog's concentration levels develop. Also be aware that most dogs
cannot cope with more than two or three tracks in a session.

Some breeds and ages of dogs have more ability to concentrate than others. Do not over stretch your dog so that it becomes disheartened or
stressed and no longer wants to go tracking with you in future. Watch your dog's body language and keenness and you will begin to develop more understanding of your dog's capabilities not only
for doing this tracking but when teaching or training it in the future.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Hard yards begin paying off for Myles Brown

Myles Brown trained really hard last year. He was eyeing individual medals in the swimming pool at both the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the Fina short-course world championships (a 25m event) that took place in Doha, Qatar, in December.

When neither materialised, he was really disappointed – so much so that he decided to take a break from swimming.
“The pressure and expectations [from within myself] got the better of me,” he tells me at a coffee shop in Westville, Durban. “I didn’t achieve what I wanted to do and it was quite a big disappointment for me. Straight after Doha, I took one and a half months off swimming.”

Brown spent that month surfing, playing golf and doing a lot of thinking. “A break is obviously not advisable for a swimmer, but for me it was necessary – to figure out why I was doing what I was doing and to regain my love and passion for the sport.”

The break seems to have paid off for the 22-year-old, if his performances at April’s South African National Aquatic Championships in Durban are anything to go by.

Brown dominated the freestyle events at the King’s Park swimming pool, speeding to gold in the 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle races. On the first day of the championships, he set a new South African 400m freestyle mark of 3:46.08, breaking a record set by Ryk Neethling in 1999. Four days later, Brown broke the South African 800m freestyle record set by Troyden Prinsloo in 2009.

Beating Chad le Clos
In between he caused an upset, beating Olympic gold medallist Chad le Clos in the 200m freestyle final. How did that make him feel? “He’s a great racer; he’s one of the best swimmers in the world. It’s kind of special to have someone like that in the swimming pool that you can race and train with,” said Brown. He and Le Clos are coached by Graham Hill.

“To beat him was great; it’s a step in the right direction. Racing can go anywhere – you never know what’s going to happen on the day. Fortunately this time I got the better of him, but who knows? On the day it can go either way.”

Brown’s times in the 200m, 400m and 800m saw him qualifying for the Fina world long-course championships – which will be held in Kazan, Russia, later this year – in all three events.

When I point out that although he doesn’t have a Wikipedia page dedicated to him (yet), his name frequently featured on newspaper street posters around Durban during the championships, he grins broadly. “It’s been a nice response after the SA champs,” he says. “I’m still fairly new to the international scene. I only started making the senior teams in 2012.

“I wouldn’t say I’m one of the big names in SA swimming, but hopefully in the new year I can be one of them, along with Chad le Clos and Cameron van der Burgh.”

Brown seems to be a modest person. Although he says he wasn’t an especially good swimmer at primary school level, he was offered a swimming scholarship at Westville Boys’ High School – widely believed to be Durban’s premier training ground for schoolboy swimmers.

However, his parents wanted him to give equal attention to his academic performance, so he chose to accept a scholarship at Kearsney College, a private school situated midway between Durban and Pietermaritzburg.

Gap year
“I would get up at 4:30am and go for training, then go to school till 2:30pm, then head off to afternoon training,” he recalls. “By the time you came home it would be 6pm – but from a young age, my parents instilled in me some core values like determination and always putting in 100%.”

The perseverance paid off and he matriculated with six distinctions before registering for a BCom degree in 2011. At the end of the year, he and his parents decided it was time for him to take a gap year so that he could focus on getting to London for the 2012 Olympics.

But it was not to be – Brown didn’t qualify for London; something he considers a blessing in disguise. “I don’t think I was mentally ready. I was very new to swimming on an international stage. I didn’t focus on the negatives. I stayed at home and watched the Olympics, and we had a very good swimming team.

“That was one of the turning points in my swimming career. After that, I really picked up my effort and ended up qualifying for my first world short-course event in Turkey.”

In 2008, as a 16-year-old, Brown had watched his hero Michael Phelps reign supreme in the pool at the Beijing Olympics. “It was truly inspirational to watch him,” he says. “I’ve always wanted to go to the Olympics and compete. I think it’s a great honour, and the pinnacle of a sportsman’s career.”

Could Rio 2016 be the realisation of a long-held dream? He smiles. “It’s been a goal. I won’t say I get up every day and think of it, but I just want to try to have a really good year this year, and carry that momentum on to the Olympics next year.”",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

It was the simplicity of a haiku, the elegance of a sonnet and the complexity of free verse at once. And like any brilliant piece of art, KeVaughn Allen's half-court heave moved those who experienced it beyond words. But instead of staying silent, they screamed.

And screamed and screamed and screamed.

Long after the Gators had left the court for halftime, they were still screaming about Allen's lucky break. About how, off an inbound pass from Chris Chiozza with under three seconds left to the break, he toed the boundary of the court, beat one defender and, like John Wayne drawing his pistol from his belt, heaved the ball from his hip.

""It looked like it was going wide left,"" Allen said, ""but then, at the last second, it curved right.""

The ball landed about 75 feet away and splashed into the net like a missile from nowhere, nearly blowing up the O'Connell Center in the process. But as thrilling as the moment was, Florida is used to that sort of purple prose to start games. It's also used to tragedy to finish them. On Saturday, though, there was no hubris and heartbreak. Only electricity and elation.

Led by Allen, who aside from his buzzer beater scored a game-leading 24 points, the Gators (18-11, 9-7 Southeastern Conference) snatched a 72-66 win from feisty No. 12 Auburn (24-5, 12-4 SEC) in a game that, staying on the theme of literature, climaxed in the final moments. And for the first time in three games, the climax went in Florida’s favor.

“We needed that one, didn’t we?” coach Mike White said.

Allen didn't start off like a man poised to make the shot of his life. He was 0-for-5 before his first bucket, but from there, he made five more shots in a row and finished 8-for-15.

He had help from Jalen Hudson, who added 19 points, and Dontay Bassett, who made his first start and contributed a career-high 12 points, six rebounds and a team-high two steals. White credited Bassett's performance to his team-first mentality, which is also how Bassett explained his emergence.

“We needed this win,” he said.

The Gators struggled to close games during the three-game losing streak they carried into Saturday. Each loss was by five points or fewer. Which is why, when a timeout was called with 15:38 left in the game, someone piped up in the huddle and urged the team to not let the game slip away.

“Guys,” White interrupted, “do not look at the clock. This is not about holding on.”

He wanted Florida to stay aggressive, and the Gators did. But Auburn still pushed, and with 3:55 to play, the Tigers claimed their first lead.

The game became a western shootout from there. The lead changed six times in those final minutes, with Allen contributing back-to-back threes to keep UF afloat. Then, with 50 seconds left, the unthinkable.

Florida center Kevarrius Hayes hustled around a defender and swiped a loose ball from the abyss, passing it toward a teammate with a two-point lead. The referees said he stepped out.

Replays showed that Hayes didn’t appear to step out, but the call stood anyway. Auburn tied the game on the ensuing possession, and the arena turned from an atmosphere of tension to one of rage.

That was quickly reversed by an and-one from Hudson, which gave the Gators their final lead and sent fans into a flailing noodle-arm frenzy.

“I felt like they were out there on the court with us,” Chiozza said of the especially energetic crowd.

White said he wants his team to enjoy the win. To use it as motivation with two regular-season contests left. But he also doesn’t want his players to dwell. He admits they haven’t handled winning well this season.

“I hope it makes us feel good for about an hour,” White said. “We play in Tuscaloosa on Tuesday night.”

February 23, 2018

GAINESVILLE — The evening built to a crescendo with Kennedy Baker's floor routine as the climax. The senior was the anchor for the Gators not just on the event, but for the meet. With Florida still in range of its highest score of 2018, she made her first pass without issue. Then her foot hit the mat at the end of her next pass.

Snap.

And her body followed, as did a silence that roared through the arena, turning it from a party to a funeral in a way that only a serious injury can.

The music stopped immediately, and trainers rushed toward Baker. Her screams could be heard from press row. She couldn't stand, so they carried her to the locker room, her face wet, her teammates in shock.

The meet was already over at that point — even without Baker's score, the No. 5 Gators dominated the visiting No. 11 Arkansas Razorbacks 197.625-196.875. But fans left in near silence after her fall, not knowing if Baker will ever compete again.

""I think it's a little too early to tell,"" coach Jenny Rowland said of Baker's injury. Baker is one of only two current UF gymnasts to have scored a perfect 10.

Baker's fall was the story of the night, but to that point, the Gators had displayed some elite gymnastics.

Florida notched its highest score of the season on the meet's first event, vault, at 49.525. Seniors Rachel Slocum and McMurtry led the Gators through the event, posting 9.95s.

That set the tone for the night, as the Gators didn't lose any event aside from the one where Baker fell.

McMurtry and sophomore Rachel Gowey shared the beam title (9.95) as well as the bars title (9.925). Alicia Boren won the floor with a 9.95, as well as the all around with a 39.525.

""Overall, this team did a fantastic job,"" Rowland said. She added that Baker was Friday's Gator of the day in her opening remarks following the meet.

""She has their back,"" Rowland added, ""and they have her back.""

The meet took place in a pinked-out O'Connell Center, from the cloths on the judges' tables to the fans in the stands to the gymnasts, who wore pink leotards to raise awareness for breast cancer. The theme was especially meaningful for Boren, whose aunt Kathy is a survivor of the disease and was in attendance.

""I was happy that she was here,"" Boren said. ""More than happy — I was ecstatic.”

Florida was cruising toward a season-best score until the floor routines, when freshman Alyssa Baumann stepped out of bounds at the end of a tumbling pass and McMurtry stumbled at the end of a pass as well. Their scores of 9.725 and 9.65, respectively, were Florida's two worst scores of the night.

Then Baker came on, and you know the rest. So while Florida improved to 7-1 on the season, Friday’s meet provided more questions — rather one big, all-important question — than answers.

February 16, 2018

GAINESVILLE — Alex Faedo — Florida's 2017 ace, College World Series MVP and first-round MLB Draft pick — was back on the McKethan Stadium mound on Friday. Although he never actually made it to the rubber.

The flame-throwing righthander instead wore jeans and a 2017 title T-Shirt as he threw out the ceremonial first pitch for Florida's season-opening game against Siena. In a symbolic moment, Brady Singer trotted out of the dugout moments later to take Faedo's Friday night spot on that mound and usher in a new season of Florida baseball.

""He gave me a high five and told me good luck,"" Singer said of Faedo. He also noted that they rarely talked to each other before starts. Neither wanted to break the other's concentration.

Clearly the high five and pair of words didn't have any negative effect on Singer, as he dominated Siena in seven innings. The junior righthander struck out eight, walked one and allowed no earned runs in Florida's 7-1 opening-night win.

And perhaps most impressively, Singer offered 24 first-pitch strikes to the 24 hitters he faced.

""That's the one thing I wanted to do,"" Singer said, ""was go out there and throw strikes.""

Coach Kevin O'Sullivan noted that with first-game jitters and his first Friday night start, the game could be one of Singer's most difficult of the season. He compared him to Faedo, who in last year's season opener against William and Mary allowed four earned runs in four and 2/3 innings.

Singer, obviously, didn't have similar issues.

""He was sharp,"" O'Sullivan said.

Freshman lefty Jordan Butler completed the two-hitter for Florida, tossing two scoreless innings with four strikeouts to end the game.

""You could just see the competitive spirit he has,"" O'Sullivan said of Butler, who will also hit this season.

Four Florida players — Nelson Maldonado, JJ Schwarz, Blake Reese and Nick Horvath — had two hits on the night, while five players notched RBIs. Among them were newcomers Brady McConnell and Wil Dalton.

McConnell had a rough go in his first college game, striking out on his first three at-bats. He also committed a costly error that gave Siena its only run of the game.

But after a hug from Singer following the error and a talk with O'Sullivan following the string of strikeouts, he smashed a home run to give the Gators their final two runs of the game.

""I knew it was gone,"" he said of his arching rainbow shot. Junior third baseman Jonathan India also hit a home run — a solo shot in the fourth inning — that cleared the left-field bleachers and gave the Gators their first run of 2018.

As for Dalton, he roped a ball to left field on his third at-bat of the game to claim his first hit and RBI at UF. The sophomore transferred from junior college and started in right field.

""I started to relax toward the end of the game and simplify things,"" he said.

The Gators continue their three-game weekend homestand against Siena on Saturday afternoon at 4, with Singer's roommate Jackson Kowar scheduled to start for Florida. O'Sullivan tried to temper expectations for that game and the rest of the season, though he did so with a smile.

January 23, 2018

GAINESVILLE — The headliner is Jordan Scarlett, the running back who was supposed to lead Florida's backfield in 2017 before he was suspended ahead of the team's season opener and never returned. He, along with eight teammates, were accused of credit card fraud. Scarlett and three of those teammates were cleared to rejoin the team on Tuesday, ending a monthslong hiatus for the quartet.

Linebackers Ventrell Miller and James Houston along with receiver Rick Wells were also cleared to return, but again, Scarlett is the most consequential of the group. The St. Thomas Aquinas alumnus rushed for a team-best 907 yards and six touchdowns in 2016.

Newcomers Malik Davis and Adarius Lemons stepped up in Scarlett's absence and will push him for playing time alongside rising junior Lamical Perine, who led the Gators with 588 rushing yards and eight rushing touchdowns in 2017.

Incoming recruits Iverson Clement and Dameon Pierce could also factor into Florida's backfield. But assuming Scarlett has stayed in shape during his time away from the team, he should be the favorite to start come UF's season opener against Charleston Southern on Sept. 1 after all the unfulfilled hype he carried into the season that never was.

Wells, a rising redshirt sophomore wideout, has never caught a pass in college. And both Miller and Houston were true freshmen a season ago, so neither one of them has played a college snap either. Both of them could, however, play an important role in the upcoming season by bolstering Florida's depth at linebacker — a position group that underperformed in 2017 and needs capable bodies behind starters Vosean Joseph and David Reese.

The four reinstated players were part of a group of seven who signed agreements with the State Attorney's Office to avoid felony charges for their alleged credit card fraud if they follow the agreements.

As for the remaining suspended players, four of them have left the school. Defensive end Jordan Smith, defensive lineman Richerd Desir-Jones and offensive lineman Kadeem Telfort have all opted to transfer elsewhere. Desir-Jones will transfer to Coffeyville Community College in Kansas while Smith and Telfort haven't announced their transfer destinations. Smith and Telfort are also the two players who were not offered pre-trial intervention programs. Smith still faces a potential nine felony charges while Telfort faces a potential 30.

Antonio Callaway, the former star receiver and Miami Booker T. Washington alum, opted to leave Florida early for the NFL Draft.

Keivonnis Davis, a Miami Central alumnus, is the only player whose case has yet to be resolved. Davis was involved in a scooter accident during his suspension, and it's unknown if his injuries will prevent him from playing football this season and beyond. He's still enrolled in classes.

These smiles shouldn't accompany loss. These giggles shouldn't serve as the anthem of the vanquished. But on Friday night in Gainesville, following a 197.250-197.125 Florida loss to No. 1 LSU, they did.

Following their defeat, four UF gymnats, along with coach Jenny Rowland, didn't trudge to their post-match press conference, nor did they walk. They practically skipped.

Once seated in front of the room, seniors Kennedy Baker, Alex McMurtry and Rachel Slocum told jokes, lauhed and didn't care who saw. ""Literally nothing matters,"" one of them sang. ""It's only January 12th.""

That was the attitude Rowland took when addressing the assembled reporters, noting the team has plenty of work to do, but there's still ample time to do it. Plus she said depsite the losing score, she saw imporvement compared to the team's season-opening win last week at West Virginia.

The improvement, she said, centered around the team's energy. She noticed her gymnasts wrapping their arms around each other between routines and staying engaged during their teammates' performances. The 9,661-fan sellout — the first of Rowland's three-year tensure as head coach — probably helped, too.

Still, she said energy aside, there's lots for the team to work on.

""Fixing the little things,"" she said.

The Gators were led by junior Alicia Boren, who placed second in the all-around to LSU's Myia Hambrick. Boren notched a 39.450.

McMurtry, who couldn't compete on floor because of lingering back issues and therefore didn't qualify for the all-around, led the Gators on vault (9.90) and bars (9.925). Sophomore Rachel Gowey won beam (9.950) and Baker tied with freshman Megan Skaggs for Florida's top floor score (9.925).

Baker's floor routine was one of the highlights of the night. It featrued, as she admitted following the meet, plenty of sass, including playing a whipping noise accompanied by a whipping motion where her teammates fell to the floor.

""I was just lit the whole routine,"" Baker said. ""Seeing my teammates fall when I whipped them was just icing on the cake.""

While the team was very clear about this part of the season having little impact on where it ends up, it has a week off before traveling to Lexington to face Kentucky next Friday at 7 p.m.

December 20, 2017

Florida could still land a few more recruits before the day is done, but here's who the Gators have reeled in so far on the first day of the first-ever early signing period. Quarterback Emory Jones is their top recruit at No. 40 overall, and UF's class — counting commitments as well as signees — ranks 17th nationally.

Emory Jones, quarterback:

The centerpiece of Mullen’s early signing day haul is Emory Jones, a 4-star dual threat quarterback from Georgia who spurned his commitment to Ohio State and picked the Gators. Jones is rated as the fourth-best dual threat quarterback in the country by the 247Sports Composite and the nation’s 40th-best player overall.

Mullen made Jones a priority for the quarterback-starved Gators, who had just three scholarship tossers — Feleipe Franks, Kyle Trask and Jake Allen — on their roster before Wednesday. Known as a quarterback guru after transforming Dak Prescott into a Heisman candidate at Mississippi State, among other success stories, Mullen’s first priority at Florida will be getting either Jones or any of UF’s other quarterbacks to a level of competence. He believes he’s off to a good start with Jones.

Evan McPherson, kicker:

While he’s Florida’s lowest-rated signee of the day and probably of the year, McPherson’s commitment to the Gators could end up being one of the most important of 2018. Junior Eddy Pineiro announced Tuesday that he’s leaving Florida early for the NFL Draft, so McPherson should challenge redshirt senior and Miami Belen Jesuit alum Jorge Powell to replace him.

McPherson is the nation’s top-rated kicking prospect.

Kyle Pitts/Dante Lang, tight end:

Florida snagged an elite tight end prospect in Kyle Pitts, a 4-star recruit from Warminster, Pennsylvania. He’s billed as the sixth-best tight end in the nation and brings great size to the position at 6-foot-6, 235 pounds.

The Gators lost tight ends Kalif Jackson and 2017 starter DeAndre Goolsby this offseason, so Pitts adds another body to the mix. But with veterans C’yontai Lewis and Moral Stephens returning along with Kemore Gamble, who was rated the seventh-best tight end in the nation in the 2017 class, Pitts could find the field later on in his career. The same is true of Dante Lang, a 6-foot-5, 220-pound tight end out of Boca Raton who is rated the 28th best at his position. Although with Mullen, more tight end involvement is possible.

While Florida didn’t use its tight ends in the passing game much under former coach Jim McElwain (Stephens led the group with 141 yards in 2017 while Goolsby and Lewis had the most touchdowns with one apiece) Mississippi State tight end Jordan Thomas amassed 227 yards and three touchdowns for the Bulldogs last season under Mullen.

Amari Burney/Trey Dean/John Huggins/Randy Russell, safety:

Florida set itself up for success at defensive back with its 2017 class, which brought six players into the group. But with seniors Duke Dawson, Nick Washington, Marcell Harris and Joseph Putu gone, signing safeties Amari Burney, John Huggins and Randy Russell bolsters the unit’s depth.

As the nation’s 15th-best safety prospect, Burney, a Clearwater native, could challenge Chauncey Gardner, Jeawon Taylor, Shawn Davis and Quincy Lenton for playing time. He has the size at 6-foot-1, 215 pounds.

Huggins is a little smaller at 6-feet, 200 pounds, and is rated a little lower at No. 32. Russell, who signed out of Miami Carol City, is even smaller at 5-fo0t-10, 180 pounds, but he’s rated higher than Huggins at No. 28. And Dean, the latest addition to Florida's class, has great length at 6-foot-2 but need to bulk up at 180 pounds. He's rated 22nd at his position.

Dameon Pierce, running back:

The Gators lost running back Mark Thompson to eligibility expiration and could also lose Jordan Scarlett, who didn’t play in 2017 but is nevertheless eligible for the NFL Draft. Florida addressed those losses with Pierce.

Rated the nation’s 10th-best running back, Pierce’s 5-foot-11, 205-pound frame is ideal. But with returning backs Lamical Perine, Malik Davis and Adarius Lemons in front of him on the depth chart, it will be an uphill climb for Pierce to see the field consistently in 2018.

That being said, he’s a higher-rated recruit then Davis was, and he finished second on the team in rushing as a true freshman.

Iverson Clement, athlete:

Clement is listed as an athlete by recruiting services, but he plays running back and is expected to stay at that position when he arrives in Gainesville. Pierce brings acceptable size at 5-foot-11, 199 pounds and is ranked as the nation’s 282nd-best recruit. Like Pierce, he'll have to claw onto the depth chart with three experienced backs ahead of him.

Chris Bleich/Noah Banks, offensive tackle:

The Gators addressed a need at offensive tackle with a pair of large additions. Chris Bleich, a 6-foot-6, 305-pound player from Plymouth, Pennsylvania, and Noah Banks, a 6-foot-7, 305-pound player from Pensacola both signed with the Gators. Bleich is rated No. 33 among high school offensive tackles while Banks is No. 6 among junior college tackles. With starting left tackle Martez Ivey possibly leaving for the NFL and with all the injuries Florida suffered along the offensive line a season ago, Mullen got some valuable depth with the two of them.

David Reese, linebacker:

The Gators will have two players named David Reese at linebacker in 2018. Junior middle linebacker David Reese led the team in tackles last season, while incoming freshman outside linebacker David Reese hopes to do the same at some point during his career in Gainesville.

The younger Reese brings height to a major position of need at 6-foot-3, 213 pounds.

December 07, 2017

Coach Mike White was his normal self on Monday, strolling through the Florida basketball complex in a grey sweatsuit, a lone Nike swoosh mark on the shoulder, coffee cup in hand. He seemed calm, which was appropriate given his message to his team following its third straight loss — this time against Loyola-Chicago — on Wednesday night: Don’t panic. There are plenty of games left to play.

His team, however, seemed panicked against the Ramblers. Florida had earned its No. 5 ranking by making shots and scoring at will, but that ability has evaporated since the Gators lost to No. 1 Duke on Nov. 26. White said the only thing to do to combat the funk is play better and make shots, which he said can mask some of the other shortcomings that need to be addressed.

“We’re just not making shots right now,” White said. “We’re coming off a really, really tough week.”

It started on Monday, when the Gators were dominated by Florida State in a 17-point loss. It marked UF’s fourth consecutive loss to the Seminoles.

Florida two leading scorers — guards Jalen Hudson and Egor Koulechov — shot a combined 9-of-24 against FSU, including 3-of-13 from 3-point range. The rest of the team couldn’t do much better.

The Gators shot 37 percent combined against Loyola and Florida State, with nearly identical percentages in each game. Like with Hudson and Koulechov, the shooting has been even worse from deep. The Gators went 8-of-44 in the two games.

White said he didn’t see the sudden frost coming. He said based on practice, he thought his team was just a good shooting team, and he expected that trend to continue. But he has a couple hypotheses for why.

First is the fact that the two games have been at home, and maybe that’s caused some jitters. Then there’s shot selection.

“Let’s make sure your first shot is a really good one,” White’s told his players. “We've gotten away with making a contested one or two early in games early in the season against inferior opponents, and that's backfired on us.”

Florida’s lack of size has also backfired. The Gators’ three leading rebounders are guards — Hudson, Koulechov and Chris Chiozza — and that trio is UF’s only representation on the Southeastern Conference’s top 32 rebounders.

The issue was especially prominent against FSU, which outrebounded the Gators 51-34.

“We're just a very average defensive and rebounding team,” White said, “and when we're not making shots, it's hard to beat anybody.”

But White is trying to extract at least positive from those struggles. He said maybe his players didn’t really believe they were in trouble when they were scoring in the triple digits game after game while allowing other teams to score high as well.

Now that shots aren’t falling and rebounds aren’t getting grabbed, White said his team will learn and get tougher. Florida will have a chance to show off that toughness, or not, on Saturday against No. 17 Cincinnati (7-1). White, meanwhile, will stay calm and sip his coffee with SEC play still several weeks away, trying to get his players to a similar level of tranquility.

“Is everything OK?” They’ve asked him in recent days. “Coach, are you good?”

“Yeah,” White has answered. “We're alive and healthy and we have a great opportunity today and we're in Florida. Are you kidding me? An opportunity to have a great practice today, come together, get better. Tough week, (but) a lot of people in Gainesville are having a lot tougher time in life than we are right now.”

Antonio Callaway, a Miami native and star Florida receiver, will forgo his final year of eligibility at UF and enter the NFL Draft, per a report from InsideTheLeague.com's Neil Stratton.

Callaway's career at Florida was marred by controversy, from accusations of sexual assault as a freshman to his suspension for the entirety of the 2017 season — along with eight other players — for accusations of credit card fraud. But his play on the field was memorable, too.

The Miami Booker T. Washington alumnus was Florida's leading receiver in his freshman and sophomore seasons, grabbing 678 and 721 yards, respectively. He finished his college career with seven touchdowns, including a memorable 63-yarder against Tennessee as a freshman that helped the Gators stun the Volunteers.

Callaway's 5-foot-10, 193-pound frame is smaller than a typical NFL receiver and his speed also isn't elite, but his playmaking ability when he was on the field at Florida was never in doubt. That should at least get him drafted at some point, though it's unclear how much his off-the-field issues may also play a role in his stock.

December 06, 2017

The Gators lost to Duke — the No. 1 team in the nation — fewer than two weeks ago by just three points. But since then, Florida has fallen apart.

The No. 5 Gators (5-3) dropped their third straight game on Wednesday against Loyola-Chicago (9-1) at home, 65-59. The Ramblers' six-point win was Florida's second-worst loss of the season, trailing only Monday's 17-point beatdown from Florida State. The Ramblers led for over 95 percent of the game.

Florida, which boasted the nation's most prolific offense entering the game against FSU at just over 99 points per game, has gone cold from deep since the loss to Duke. It went 2-of-19 from 3-point range against Loyola.

Transfer Egor Koulechov, who scored 34 points for Florida on opening night and was counted on as one of the team's leading scorers, is the embodiment of that frost. The senior went 1-for-10 from 3-point range against FSU and Loyola combined. He also went 7-of-26 from the floor over that same stretch.

He and his team have three days to correct that problem, as well as struggling interior defense, before they take on Cincinnati (7-1) on Saturday in Newark, New Jersey.

November 19, 2017

Brandon Powell is the face of Florida's pending showdown with Florida State.

The senior from Deerfield Beach has never beaten the Seminoles during his time at UF, and this Saturday will be his last chance to do so. It seems like he's let his teammates know it.

After their 36-7 win over UAB on Saturday, two teammates brought him up unprompted.

First was running back Lamical Perine, who said he was just discussing the FSU game with Powell. Then there was center Tyler Jordan, who said basically the same thing.

""We were just talking about that in the locker room,"" he said. ""[Powell's] 0-3 against Florida State. We want to send him out with a win.”

But for Jordan, it's more than just wanting to send him out with a win. He said he's sure of it.

""Beating Florida State’s going to be something we’re going to do,"" he said.

Defensive tackle Taven Bryan is also sure of it.

""I’m expecting honestly that we’re going to win the next game very solidly,"" he said. ""We’ve just been taking steps and getting better and better. Next week we should have a good solid week and play way better than we did this week.”

Bryan is right. The Gators took steps forward against UAB. They rushed for a season-best 257 yards. They avoided any turnovers. They scored their second-most points of the season. But all of that matters little when the Conference USA opponent was overmatched, despite its winning record. Florida has a chance to take a real step forward this weekend against the Seminoles.

That step forward will probably get them across the finish line, because win or lose, Florida will finish with a losing record. That makes a bowl game unlikely. So it's up to the Gators whether they want to cross in stride or limp on through.

""We just need a couple of more fans in there,"" Bryan said, ""and we’ll get thing loud and we’ll win a game for them.""

The official attendance against UAB was 84,649, though there seemed to be far fewer fans in the stands than that number suggests. The team is hoping more fans come out against FSU despite both team having down years.

""That's always going to be one of the pivotal games in college football,"" Florida coach Randy Shannon said.

His players are hoping that brings fans back for one last game in a season that many of them would like to forget.

“It’s really big,"" Jordan said. ""Our biggest in-state rival. Big game at The Swamp. It’s going to be a fun one. It’s something we’re going to work on all week, because we’re going to be busting our ass all week to get ready for this team.”

November 02, 2017

He came to Florida to play his final season of college football only to get beat out by redshirt freshman Feleipe Franks. But finally, after seven contests, Malik Zaire will get his shot.

When the Gators travel to Missouri this weekend to take on the Tigers, Zaire will start under center for the first time this season.

""This is his opportunity,"" interim coach Randy Shannon said, ""to get this team where it needs to be and not to be satisfied just because he's the starter.""

Shannon said Monday he planned to shake things up and do things his way while leading the Gators through the end of the 2017 season. He made that clearer with this move, departing from former coach Jim McElwain's preference for Franks.

Franks started six of Florida's seven games this season, amassing 830 passing yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions. The remaining game was started by Luke Del Rio, who was lost for the season.

Zaire has only played in mop-up duty, helping Florida limp to the finish line in games that were out of reach. In those two appearances, he's thrown for 142 yards and no touchdowns.

Zaire is more mobile than Franks, who at 6-foot-6 has shown the ability to scramble some, but it's not viewed as a strength. Sometimes he also scrambles to his detriment, sensing nonexistent pressure and leaving the pocket only to lose yards near the sideline. Zaire hasn't had many opportunities to show that he can do better, but he'll get one in Columbia.

He just has to make the most of it. Shannon said the competition between him and Franks, who will serve as the primary backup this weekend, is ongoing.

""Today is an opportunity for him to run the offense and understand the expectations that we have for him,"" Shannon said. ""This is not a time for him to feel comfortable and feel like he's made it. We want him to keep grinding and understand that competition is very good.""

October 29, 2017

Jim McElwain's firing is the news of the day, week, month and year for the Florida football program. But with the team now having lost three consecutive games, where does it go from here? A few clues were offered Saturday.

First, at quarterback, where starter Feleipe Franks managed 30 yards on 19 attempts. He was relieved by backup Malik Zaire, who managed 36 yards on six attempts and added 30 rushing yards well after the game was out of reach.

""It’s not showing up on Saturday,"" Franks said of the lack of offensive improvement. ""There’s a lot of things we can improve on. Like I said man. we’re not going to fold. We’re not going to just bow our heads down.""

McElwain didn't address Zaire's apparent spark after the game, though his opinion matters little now. With the SEC title game now officially out of reach, it'll be interesting to see how Florida approaches the quarterback competition between Franks — the incumbent starter who played poorly in meaningful action — and Zaire — the Notre Dame graduate transfer who didn't work out as a starter but who played well on Saturday in meaningless action.

Florida's offense took a hit at running back, where leading rusher Malik Davis was injured and taken to the locker room in the first half. McElwain said he injured his knee, and reports surfaced Sunday that it was season-ending. Davis' mom told the Herald those reports were premature and he hadn't had an MRI yet, but Davis retweeted several teammates wishing him a speedy recovery. So season ending or not, it doesn't sound good. Davis, a true freshman from Tampa, leads the team with 526 yards this season.

His counterpart Lamical Perine managed 93 yards in Davis' absence against the Bulldogs. He's up to 365 on the year, and he's scored six touchdowns.

October 25, 2017

A Florida assistant coach meets with reporters every Wednesday at noon. The coach rotates from week to week, but the procedure is usually the same: Ask about each individual player in that position group, because who knows when that coach will speak again. This Wednesday was receiver coach Kerry Dixon’s turn, but the procedure was a little different.

Only two players were asked about by name: Tyrie Cleveland and Kadarius Toney. That makes sense. When they’re on, Florida’s offense is noticeably improved. When they’re not, like against Texas A&M when they were both injured, well, Florida’s offense is even worse than usual. So heading into a game Florida (3-3, 3-2 Southeastern Conference) must win to stay in slim contention for the SEC eastern division title, it wasn’t surprising to hear them brought up. Because without them, Florida’s chances this Saturday against No. 3 Georgia (7-0, 4-0 SEC), which are already bad (the Bulldogs opened as 14 ½-point favorites), are much worse.

Toney came up in the second question of Dixon’s press conference. He’s the less important of the tandem based on production. At 107 yards through the air this year, he ranks fourth on the team. But his value is more in his electricity.

He can run the ball on sweeps, he can run out of the wildcat formation, he can catch passes, and as a guy who played quarterback in high school, he can throw as well. That versatility is why he’s listed as an athlete — the only athlete — on Florida’s roster. If there was such a thing as the “eyeball test” for Florida’s offense, his moves and cuts would make him one of the few guaranteed to pass.

“We knew he was special in the spring,” Dixon said. “Moving forward we definitely hope to use him a lot more.""

McElwain said Wednesday afternoon that Toney’s return is not certain, but he’s “doing everything” to be able to play.

Cleveland came up a little later for Dixon. Despite not registering a catch in UF’s last two games — that’s a third of the season — he still has twice as many yards as the next-closest receiver at 326. Brandon Powell is next at 149. He missed those two games with a high ankle sprain, and his absence limited Florida’s vertical passing game. Coach Jim McElwain said that will be a big part of this weekend’s contest against Georgia given how the Bulldogs load the box to stop the running game.

“We're going to have to make some plays downfield,” he said.

Players sounded hopeful Cleveland will be back. So did McElwain, who called him probable.

""He's back to his normal self,” Powell said. “It's just an ankle sprain, so he needed some time off, he got the bye week, so now he's back to his old self.”

However, Powell then referred to the abilities of other players in the wideout group.

“We've got playmakers everywhere,” he said. “Just to have another one of our playmakers back just makes us that much better.”

That’s not exactly true. At least not so far. In the two games without Cleveland, UF managed 135 and 108 passing yards. With him, it’s managed 249, 209, 212 and 181. Dixon knows the difference Cleveland makes.

""There's a comfort level when you have that deep threat out there,” he said. “They have to make certain coverage adjustments to him, which is a great asset to the offense.”

-- In addition to updates on Toney and Cleveland, McElwain said defensive end Jabari Zuniga, who was nursing an ankle injury, should be able to play. He added wideout Josh Hammond is questionable with a tweaked back.

-- Jim McElwain ignited Florida’s fan base Monday by revealing he’d received death threats. Some questionedthe legitimacy of those threats after UAA spokesman Steve McClain sent out statement ending with, “Our administration met with coach McElwain this afternoon and he offered no additional details.” McElwain tried to clarify on Wednesday.

“It’s just something that came up and obviously was on my mind,” he said. “It doesn’t make it right. It doesn’t make it right to air that laundry, and yet at the same time [we’ve] got total, total support.”

When asked if his family was threatened directly, he said the threats were anonymous but didn’t offer many other details. His response, in its entirety:

“Obviously, I understand that's the news,” he answered. “It goes with the territory. You know what? It’s hard to leave sometimes. You know how much I care about this program, these players. Obviously, everything that goes in with it. But ultimately allowing one or two, and who even knows who it was, right? You don’t know. It’s anonymous. So, that is what it is, and I’m confident we’re all right.”

There was some speculation after Gainesville native Tom Petty passed away on Monday that the halftime show during the Florida-LSU game would honor the late musician. While that hypothesis hasn't been refuted, it now seems unlikely.

The UF Athletic Association announced Thursday that it will pay a different tribute to Petty. After the band plays ""The Boys of Old Florida"" at the conclusion of the third quarter, Petty's ""I won't back down"" will echo through Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.

""Let's celebrate together what he meant to the world of music and what he meant to this community,'' UF athletic director Scott Stricklin said in a release. ""Since we are already singing 'We are the Boys,' let's go right from that into one of his great anthems and make that the way we are going to jointly celebrate Tom Petty and the Gators.""

September 27, 2017

It wasn’t supposed to happen this way. In the season’s first game, on the Dallas Cowboys’ field, playing on national television against the storied Michigan Wolverines, Florida’s offensive line was supposed to do the pushing rather than get pushed around. Coach Jim McElwain had raved about the unit heading into the season. He said it would be a team strength. Yet in game one, it was not .

“It was a gut punch,” offensive line coach Brad Davis said. “And it was what we needed.”

Since that game, during which Florida allowed six sacks, No. 21 UF’s offensive line has allowed three sacks combined in two games. The nine total sacks still rank 10th in the Southeastern Conference and 86th nationally, but the pass blocking has shown improvement since the stomping it took against Michigan. So has the run blocking.

The Gators managed 11 yards on the ground against the Wolverines, upped it to 168 against Tennessee and 186 against Kentucky.

Through the discouragement of the opening loss, the disappointment of missing out on a tune-up game due to Hurricane Irma, the suspension and levying of potential felony charges against freshman tackle Kadeem Telfort and back-to-back last-second wins, Florida’s offensive line has shown one thing it preached in the pre-season has come true: Thanks to the bonds formed within the unit, it’s been able to tune out distractions.

Now, the classic sports cliche of “just focusing on the game” and forgetting about hurricanes, suspensions, close wins and poor performances is repeated across sports whenever something bad happens to a team. Granted. But Florida’s offensive line has shown its legitimately capable of doing it. One player even says those challenges help.

“It made it a lot easier on us,” left tackle Martez Ivey said. “It’s like, we can fight through adversity and come together and we can still win, still push each other every day to come out and play hard.”

The improvements shouldn’t be a total surprise. Florida’s offensive line features a group of highly ranked, tall, heavy players, starting with Ivey.

He was the top-ranked offensive lineman in the class of 2015, carried five stars and was rated as the nation’s second-best player. He was joined by UF’s now-starting right guard Fred Johnson, who was a three-star recruit, but one who was 6-foot-7, 301 pounds in high school, held offers from Virginia Tech. Nebraska and Tennessee, and played his freshman year at Florida.

Right guard Brett Heggie was rated as the sixth-best center in the nation in the class of 2016 by the 247Sports Composite in addition to being an Under Armour All American. And go-to backup Tyler Jordan was also an Under Armour All American rated the seventh-best center in the country.

That leaves T.J. McCoy and Jawaan Taylor. McCoy is the outlier of the group, having come to Florida as a transfer from North Carolina State to be closer to his ailing father in Orlando. He was relegated to third-string center duty until late into last season when a string of injuries forced him into action. Since then, the 6-foot-1, 314-pound leader of the offensive line hasn’t lost his job. And Taylor, the team’s heaviest offensive lineman at 334 pounds, made the All-SEC Freshman Team last season.

Still, there was work to be done after Michigan tore through them like bullets through paper.

“To go out and underperform and underachieve was a huge disappointment,” Davis said. “My job as a coach is to not beat them up or tear them down. It’s to build.”

He’s done so by trying to improve communication and eliminate “self-inflicted wounds,” like penalties and missed assignments. He said his players have responded well.

“They handled it like men,” he said.

McCoy added having Luke Del Rio at quarterback helped with the communication.

“He does a great job of calling out the play and explaining it to everybody,” he said. “He does a great job of that and keeping everybody together.""

And McElwain, with all the off-field distractions, said it’s expected of the offensive line to tune out. When nine of your teammates are suspended -- including one from your own unit -- you’ve missed a game, your quarterback position is in constant flux, what’s one bad opening game?

“I think there's one thing these guys have done a pretty good job of,” McElwain said, “is dealing with some things.""

Redshirt freshman defensive lineman Jordan Smith is facing four more potential felony charges, according to Alachua County court records.

In a sworn complaint affidavit filed Wednesday by the Gainesville Police Department, Smith is accused of using a stolen credit card to pay $1,007.82 to his apartment complex, the Woodlands of Gainesville.

On Monday, the University of Florida Police Department accused Smith of 18 felony counts. Wednesday's complaint affidavit brings his total potential charges up to 22 by adding two charges of larceny-grand theft and two of fraud.

The State Attorney's Office will decide whether to ultimately press charges against Smith and the other eight players accused of fraud.

The nine Florida football players who have been suspended since August are facing potential felony charges for fraud, according to sworn complaint affidavits filed Monday by the University of Florida Police Department.

The State Attorney's Office will review the evidence and decide whether to formally charge the players.

Most of the players are accused of using stolen credit card information to transfer money to their student debit card accounts, which they then used to purchase laptop computers, iPads and headphones, among other items.

The nine players are facing 62 criminal counts.

Seven of the nine are accused of making one purchase. Smith and Telfort are accused of using multiple cards to make multiple purchases.

According to the complaints, Callaway spent 2,022.44 on a 13-inch MacBook Pro, which came with gloss black Beats headphones thanks to a coupon code, after using the stolen credit card to transfer $1,970 into his student debit account. Scarlett also bought a MacBook with rose gold headphones.

The same complaint says some of the players admitted to selling what they bought. On Aug. 1, Smith bought three different types of Beats headphones ranging in price from $69.99 to $149.99.

The complaint filed against Scarlett says he used his girlfriend's account to make his purchase after transferring $1,940 from the stolen card to it.

When interviewed by police, she said Scarlett told her there was money on her account from ""an agent"" in New York and that he needed her to come with him to the UF bookstore to pick out a computer. He told police he transferred the money to her account because “he needed the money but did not want to get in trouble.""

Telfort is alleged to have used stolen information to buy items ranging from a combo meal at Sonic to an iPad (with $99 insurance) to gummy worms.

The group has a heavy South Florida connection. The two most prominent names -- Callaway, a starting receiver, and Scarlett, a starting running back -- are both from the area, with Callaway, like Telfort, having attended Booker T. Washington in Miami and Scarlett having attended St. Thomas Aquinas in Ft. Lauderdale.

Davis attended Miami Central. Houston attended Plantation American Heritage, and Desir-Jones is also an Aquinas alum.

Scarlett, Callaway, Miller, Davis, Desir-Jones, Smith and Telfort have been suspended since Aug. 13. Scarlett and Wells joined them on Aug. 30.

The news of the affidavits being filed broke in the middle of coach Jim McElwain's press conference on Monday, and McElwain said he was unaware of it. When asked, he said no decisions have been made about the futures of those players.

“You’re asking me something I don’t even know about,” he said.

He added that, if charged, the news could change the players' situations.

""Darn right,"" he said.

Center T.J. McCoy, who spoke to reporters shortly after McElwain, said he still has faith in those players returning.

""I really believe that those guys are gonna come back,"" he said, ""and I believe they're gonna help us to have a great season.""

September 07, 2017

The Gators wont play Northern Colorado this Saturday in The Swamp. The school announced Thursday that the game is canceled and wont be rescheduled due to Hurricane Irma.

“As the Hurricane’s track has approached the state of Florida,"" UF Athletics Director Scott Stricklin said in a release, ""it’s become obvious that playing a football game is not the right thing to do. The focus of our state and region needs to be on evacuations and relief efforts.""

On Wednesday, the school had moved the game up from its original 7:30 p.m. start to noon. But because of everything coming to Gainesville for a football game entails -- filling up on gas, driving on highways, buying snack food and water -- Stricklin said playing the game just wasn't the right thing to do. Plus there are 3,300 working personnel, 17 government agencies and outside vendors who bus employees from Jacksonville and Orlando to Gainesville, per a press release,. Stricklin said he didn't want to clog up those resources incase they're needed elsewhere.

""Playing a college football game Saturday,"" he said, ""would only add to that stress.""

Coach Jim McElwain agreed. While he was excited about the game in press conferences leading up to it, he also noted how the approach of Hurricane Irma put his life into perspective. When the game was canceled, he reiterated those thoughts.

“When you look at the impact this event could have, you have to sit back and realize what’s really important in life,” he said in a release. “In this case, we’re doing everything we can to help facilitate with what may occur.""

He also emphasized that many of the team's players are from South Florida and sent well wishes to them and their families.

The university said ticket holders will be notified about refunds individually.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"Home team cleans up at Central spelling bee

Cameron Fuller, the first home-schooled spelling bee winner in Chinle Agency history, correctly spells a word to stay in the competiton Wednesday at the Chinle Agency Spelling Bee.

advertisement

Is there such a thing as a home court advantage at a spelling bee?

There certainly seemed to be Wednesday as students from the hosting Piñon Unified School District swept six of the 10 positions at the Chinle Agency Spelling Bee to qualify for the Navajo Nation Spelling Bee on March 13.

Eighth-grade champion Catherine Lopez and runner-up Raquel Tom were from Piñon Middle School and Piñon Accelerated Middle School, respectively; seventh-grade champ Nykesha Nez was from Piñon Middle; and both the fifth- and fourth-grade champions, Chenoa Begaye and Latisha Mike, hailed from Piñon Elementary as did fourth-grade runner up Nigel James.

Only the sixth-grade match, won by Cameron Fuller (home-schooled) with Cina Curley (Canyon de Chelly Elementary) as the runner-up, did not include a top finisher from Piñon.

Chinle Elementary claimed the fifth-grade runner-up, Casey Jones, while the seventh-grade runner-up, Mikail Morgan, was from Chinle Junior High School.

Even Piñon's elementary school sponsor, library technician Presilita Bia, was hard-pressed to explain her team's success.

""It's only my second year as a sponsor, and these kids have only had a week and a half to study,"" she said, explaining that she was out sick most of December. ""I gave some of them a word list, but they lost it.""

advertisements

She did say the kids had good luck with words — a lot of the words used in Wednesday's bee had come up at the school's spelling bee as well.

The bee also featured Chinle Agency's first home-schooled winner, Fuller, who was a force to be reckoned with last year, when she represented Mesa View Elementary and won the lower-grades round of the Navajo Nation bee.

It was fortunate her parents, Greg and Regina Fuller, had pulled her out to home-school her this year, or she wouldn't have been able to compete; Mesa View didn't field a team this year.

Greg Fuller said he and his wife, a nurse at Chinle's IHS hospital, were somewhat at a loss helping their precocious daughter study for the bee.

""We couldn't find anyone who had entered a home-schooled child in the spelling bee,"" said Greg Fuller, a stay-at-home dad. ""We just tried whatever we could.""

Fortunately again, the Fullers are close neighbors to Samuel Yeager, last year's Navajo Nation winner, and he offered materials and advice.

Cameron, 12, did not even look worried as she coasted through ""worrisome"" to steal the title from Curley, a close competitor who went head-to-head with Fuller for five rounds.

The most exciting competition was the fifth-grade match, which went 14 rounds, the last eight of which were a pitched battle between Jones and Begaye. It was a good ""scenario"" for Begaye, who won when she spelled that word correctly.

The next bee among the regional competitions is Fort Defiance Agency's Friday at Greasewood Springs Community School, followed by Northern Agency's next Wednesday and Western's next Thursday.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

"Self-Driving Cars, Are They Coming to Our Roads?

If you are planning on buying a new 2017 vehicle, you might not know yet that it will come with connectivity. It will be able to communicate with other new models and they things like how fast the car is going, is it in its lane, and what direction it is headed. Don’t worry, after market updates won’t be far behind.

But that’s not the hot topic of the year, reports Richard Beaubien, PE, past International President of the Institute of Transportation Engineers. The hot topic today is self-driving cars, and when will they be available for all of us.

Beaubien says that estimates are three to 30 years, but some of the technology will be available in the not-too-distant future.

There’s no question about the need for better transportation for the disabled and aged.

But there are still many questions to consider. They are testing driverless cars in Michigan, primarily around Ann Arbor, where there are already 3,000 on the road communicating with each other and in the San Francisco Bay area.

But the testing has to start in a logical progression with a graduated system. First we engineers test on freeways. We started here because it’s the easiest situation to drive in because all the traffic is going in the same direction. It’s all moving about the same speed, and the road doesn’t really change shape quickly.

Then it’s on the boulevards, where we add cross traffic and traffic signals. “it’s comparatively easy.” Beaubien says of that condition.

But when you ramp up to driving in urban centers a whole new set of conditions are encountered. “Here everything is so compact, cars are coming from every which way and there’s all kinds of traffic with pedestrians and mixed intersections going on. This is the hardest kind of driving.”

When we think of rolling in self-driving vehicles, Beaubien says we think of roads that are easy to drive, and the weather is good, so bringing that technology there sounds possible. Of course, he adds, that rain can make this technology to handle. He wonders what snow will do to this technology, when lane lines are no longer visible. Some technology in expensive cars now being offered has trouble operating in inclement weather.

There’s no doubt that automated and connected cars have the potential to substantially reduce accidents. The vehicle can “see” nearby vehicles and know road conditions you cannot see. Crashes can be reduced or eliminated through driver advisories, driver warnings, and vehicle control.

There are, however, still ethical questions to be answered about all this new technology, Beaubien continues.

“Traffic is a social dance,” he observes, something he learned during over 40 years as a traffic engineer. Humans are pretty capable, he notes, and the question is how do we create robots for a human world?” Do we want a vehicle programmed not to exceed 55 mph when the rest of the traffic is going mph? Would your self-driving car strike a pedestrian rather than cross a double yellow line? And, there are definitely questions about cyber security of the vehicle’s computer.

“Finding the right balance between our personal interest and the needs of others is a finely calibrated human instinct driven by a sense of fairness, reciprocity, and common interest.” Beaubien says.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}

Full Moons and Vampires

Most of us are familiar with the effect that full moons have on werewolves, but what about the effect on vampires? Unlike their furry friends, vampires don't turn into a deadly creature only at the full of the moon. A vampire is active any night. Why, then, do we associate the full moon with vampires?

One association has to do with the way a vampire is made. It was believed that even without another vampire's involvement, a human could be turned into a vampire through a witch's curse or through improper burial. If a cat jumped over the corpse or the full moon shone upon it through a window before it was buried, the person would return from the grave as a vampire.

The full moon could also restore a wounded vampire to undead health. The vampire's body would be spread out where it could be bathed in the light of the full moon and left to revive. In Polidori’s “The Vampyre,” Lord Ruthven is shot by bandits and asks that his body be laid out where the first rays of moonlight will strike it. The body disappears. Lord Ruthven has been restored.

Inanna Arthen, author of the New England Vampire series (Mortal Touch, The Longer the Fall, All the Shadows of the Rainbow) and owner of the small press By Light Unseen Media, reminds us of another example in vampire literature. ""In the penny-dreadful Varney the Vampyre, Lord Varney is unkillable because moonlight will revive him every time he’s killed. He finally flings himself into an erupting volcano to end it all.""

There's even an example of a vampire needing moonlight to survive, in “When It was Moonlight,” by Manly Wade Wellman. Arthen tells me that in this 1940 short story, ""Edgar Allen Poe meets a vampire who is animated entirely by the moonlight; he defeats her by locking her into a dark windowless cellar where she’s cut off from the light.""

Two examples where, in literature -- not folklore, but literature -- vampires appear in full moonlight are Dracula and the legend of the Vampire of Croglin Grange. Again, Arthen, a veritable font of vampire knowledge, tells me, ""In Dracula, Jonathan Harker first sees the three vampire women standing in moonlight, and they appear able to almost dissolve into the moonlight and travel along with it. In the allegedly true 'Vampire of Croglin Grange' story reported by August Derleth, the vampire first appears on a brilliant moonlit night.""

Probably the strongest reason that we associate the full moon with vampires, though, has nothing to do with these legends. It has everything to do with visual arts. F.W. Murnau, who gave us Nosferatu, the first film adaptation of Dracula, also gave us the idea that vampires are destroyed by sunlight. Vampires in European folklore had no such vulnerability.

But after Nosferatu, the idea of vampires being destroyed by sunlight caught on and became canon. This presented a problem. If your movie scenes can't be set in daylight (because your vampires can't survive in daylight), you need some light to film in, and that light must therefore be moonlight.

In my two vampire novels, Darksome Thirst and The Old Power Returns, the full moon makes an appearance for a different reason. It's the late 1970s and a new coven of trainees has formed. They're taught that psychic power is stronger at the full moon and use that time to practice divination and other magical techniques. Soon they begin to sense something, an evil something.

Using each full moon to strengthen their powers to battle against the evil presence, the coven eventually finds the source.

Yes, the source of the evil is a vampire. Or two.

Special thanks go to Inanna Arthen for her generous sharing of knowledge for this post. If you love vampires, please visit her site at www.bylightunseenmedia.com.",{'pile_set_name': Pile-CC}
"The Story of this Striped T! New From My Closet

What you seek is seeking you!

No! It’s not some life goals post designed around a striped T, but I quoted these infamous words for encouraging you to keep running after what you really want; because you are an unapologetically obsessive soul and I am proud of you!

I can’t remember for how long I had been looking for a perfect stripped T, looked around online stores, visited the malls, and gave all the rights to my friends to spam my social media feeds whenever they spot one. So it happened last month when I stumbled upon this chic T at Outfitters, and so wanted to share my happiness with you.

I spotted it at Dolmen mall Clifton outfitters in black stripes, asked for a small size which of course was already out of stock! Knew it! The good ones for me are always taken *talking about the Tshirt here*. Mumbling a few curses I headed out and thought of checking it at Outfitter’s store at Tariq Road. The small size was available but only in teal! Hence, I compromised on the color and got back home with it!

Now, let’s talk about the shirt!

It’s a very soft and comfortable linen shirt! The cool, quirky phrase “Out of order” was something that specially made me pick it, because maybe I can relate to it in a few ways. Let’s talk about it some other day. The only downside is I have to wear a slip inside it as the fabric is a bit light! In any case, it’s meant for the hot, sultry Karachi summers so I am fine with this little inconvenience. The phrase is embossed in different colors and looks quite funky. A pair of jeans is perfect to go with it and I also tried pairing it with caprice, but it didn’t look really fancy, so I am sticking with denims here!

That was the short, trivial, not so exciting account of this shirt, I don’t even regret wasting your time, and I will continue doing it! Have a happy weekend!

"Seems we have revolution here in America erupting under our noses and there is not much we can do about it. This revolution pits compassionate children against their uncaring parents. The revolution even has a name, ""Vegan America
-- Revolt!""

The revolution was born from incidents surrounding Dave Warwak and his persistent attempts to teach Humane Education at Fox River Grove Middle School. Warwak said, ""I can't understand why they are fighting so hard against something so good. The World is behind us and prepared to help. There is every reason in the world for the school to go vegan and not one single reason to do otherwise""

PETA's Vice President, Bruce Friedberg is offering to help Fox River Grove Middle School with its transition to a vegan diet ""We'll pay for food for a week, get vegan chefs in to help and consult, whatever"". The ""Chicago Animal Rights Meetup Group"", ""Mercy for Animals"", and other groups around the world are prepared to step in and help Fox River Grove Middle School become the first vegan public school in America. The ""CARMG"" is embarking on a campaign to educate the youth of America. The group's president, Shalesh Kumbhat and Warwak are very enthusiastic about the group's new focus. The campaign consists of passing out small business cards to children wherever they may be. Thanks to Kumbhat's efforts and his extensive connections, animal rights groups, vegetarians, vegans, and humane educators all over the world will be passing out business cards to children wherever they may be. Warwak said, ""Groups are hitting the streets, during times when children are most likely to be out and about. Groups are already planning on a full force presence on Halloween. Even vegans who stay home will be passing out vegan candies accompanied by a message of love."" Warwak, then went on to say, ""So far today, I passed out 34 cards!""

The business card's front reads:

Remember the Santa Claus lie?
One lie is so big, some people prefer to keep it hidden.
So hidden, some never find out!
Do you want to live a lie?

The back reads:
